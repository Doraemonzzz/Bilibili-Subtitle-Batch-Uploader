151
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:54,410
边际填充大小的条件，所以现在让我们说我们有一个
up so right now let's say we have a graph to represent a probability P of X

152
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,640
图来表示X的概率P，我们想找到该值
up so right now let's say we have a graph to represent a probability P of X

153
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,210
图来表示X的概率P，我们想找到该值

157
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:07,810
使X的P以及X的P的最大值最大化的最大效果
X and also that maximum value of P of X so if you think that P of X being the

158
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,240
因此，如果您认为X的繁荣就是Oracle的兴旺，可能是在问什么
X and also that maximum value of P of X so if you think that P of X being the

159
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,000
因此，如果您认为X的繁荣就是Oracle的兴旺，可能是在问什么
so if you think that P of X being the prosperity Oracle may be asking what's

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,010
因此，如果您认为X的繁荣就是Oracle的兴旺，可能是在问什么

163
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:17,660
Knox的x值为什么是后验值，而不是最大值
posterior and what is not maximum value okay so the difficulty with this problem

164
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,300
好吧，所以这个问题的难处在于，如果您最大化边际
posterior and what is not maximum value okay so the difficulty with this problem

165
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,890
好吧，所以这个问题的难处在于，如果您最大化边际
okay so the difficulty with this problem right is that if you maximize marginals

166
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:26,900
好吧，所以这个问题的难处在于，如果您最大化边际

167
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,470
如果将所有XS放在一起，将得到的结果与我们必须位于的轴不同

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,900
如果将所有XS放在一起，将得到的结果与我们必须位于的轴不同
what you will get if you put all the XS together is not the same axis as we must

169
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:31,910
如果将所有XS放在一起，将得到的结果与我们必须位于的轴不同

given a key to okay and then I put Delta and evidence

367
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,579
然后我将Delta和证据潜力固定在x 6的值上
given a key to okay and then I put Delta and evidence

368
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:43,189
然后我将Delta和证据潜力固定在x 6的值上
and then I put Delta and evidence potential there to fix the value of x 6

369
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
然后我将Delta和证据潜力固定在x 6的值上
potential there to fix the value of x 6 of X 6 bar

370
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,250
X 6巴
potential there to fix the value of x 6 of X 6 bar

371
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:46,319
所以我们要压缩最大化相同的单词
potential there to fix the value of x 6 of X 6 bar

372
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:46,329
所以我们要压缩最大化相同的单词


373
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:51,639
所以我们要压缩最大化相同的单词
so we is compressing the maximization same words

374
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:51,649
所以我们要压缩最大化相同的单词
same words so we suppress what parents involve sex

375
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:55,449
所以我们压制父母涉及性棒的事情，这是列表时间
same words so we suppress what parents involve sex

376
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:58,300
所以我们压制父母涉及性棒的事情，这是列表时间
so we suppress what parents involve sex sticks and there is list times this

377
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:58,310
所以我们压制父母涉及性棒的事情，这是列表时间
sticks and there is list times this potential but the only things that

378
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,329
潜力，但唯一涉及六个六的事物，因此我们实际上可以找到
sticks and there is list times this potential but the only things that

379
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:04,660
潜力，但唯一涉及六个六的事物，因此我们实际上可以找到
potential but the only things that involve six six so we can actually find

380
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:04,670
潜力，但唯一涉及六个六的事物，因此我们实际上可以找到
involve six six so we can actually find the max2 of this with respect to its

381
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,670
相对于第六个的max2，当我们说要找到一个
involve six six so we can actually find the max2 of this with respect to its

382
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,750
相对于第六个的max2，当我们说要找到一个
the max2 of this with respect to its sixth when we say we're going to find an

vistors for possible values of x 2 x 5 because in office in a function x 10 x 5

387
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,870
因为在办公室中，函数x 10 x 5个参数给定了，所以我
vistors for possible values of x 2 x 5 because in office in a function x 10 x 5

388
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,750
因为在办公室中，函数x 10 x 5个参数给定了，所以我
because in office in a function x 10 x 5 arguments then that given right so i

389
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:24,760
因为在办公室中，函数x 10 x 5个参数给定了，所以我
arguments then that given right so i mean this time a function of the three

390
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,819
意思是这次这是三个参数的函数
arguments then that given right so i mean this time a function of the three

391

意思是这次这是三个参数的函数
mean this time a function of the three arguments okay

392
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:29,630
意思是这次这是三个参数的函数
arguments okay so X 3 X 5 arbitrary here so when we

393
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,750
X 3 X 5在这里是任意的，所以当我们必须相对于X 6合并时，我们有
arguments okay so X 3 X 5 arbitrary here so when we

394
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,210
X 3 X 5在这里是任意的，所以当我们必须相对于X 6合并时，我们有
so X 3 X 5 arbitrary here so when we must merge with respect to X 6 we have

395
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:37,220
X 3 X 5在这里是任意的，所以当我们必须相对于X 6合并时，我们有
must merge with respect to X 6 we have to do for the possible values of X 3 X 5

396
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,030
为X 3 X 5的可能值做这是非常重要的一步，好吧，
must merge with respect to X 6 we have to do for the possible values of X 3 X 5

397
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:47,380
为X 3 X 5的可能值做这是非常重要的一步，好吧，
to do for the possible values of X 3 X 5 this is very important move on okay you

398
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:47,390
为X 3 X 5的可能值做这是非常重要的一步，好吧，
this is very important move on okay you do this maximization and the same way we

399
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,829
做这个最大化，和我们消除的方法一样，我们称之为
this is very important move on okay you do this maximization and the same way we

400
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:52,780
做这个最大化，和我们消除的方法一样，我们称之为
do this maximization and the same way we did with elimination we're going to call

401
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:52,790
做这个最大化，和我们消除的方法一样，我们称之为
did with elimination we're going to call this 8 6 because 6 is the now to

402
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,290
这个8 6因为6是现在要消除的参数
did with elimination we're going to call this 8 6 because 6 is the now to

403
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:03,220
这个8 6因为6是现在要消除的参数
this 8 6 because 6 is the now to eliminate and the arguments are so

404
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:03,230
这个8 6因为6是现在要消除的参数
eliminate and the arguments are so you're going to have to compute this

405
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,730
您将必须计算此预期的抖动，无论如何都将其称为
eliminate and the arguments are so you're going to have to compute this

406
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,409
您将必须计算此预期的抖动，无论如何都将其称为
you're going to have to compute this expected shakes anyway call it the

407
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:08,419
您将必须计算此预期的抖动，无论如何都将其称为
expected shakes anyway call it the function HX X to connect start we did

408
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:13,750
功能HX X连接开始，我们用消除做了同样的事情，但是在
expected shakes anyway call it the function HX X to connect start we did

409
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,939
功能HX X连接开始，我们用消除做了同样的事情，但是在
function HX X to connect start we did the same thing with elimination but in

410
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:15,949
功能HX X连接开始，我们用消除做了同样的事情，但是在
the same thing with elimination but in elimination what did we go to add 6

411
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:20,110
消除我们去加了6
the same thing with elimination but in elimination what did we go to add 6

412
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,610
所以总的来说，如果我们必须在这里进行分析，我们就不要停止，我们必须
the same thing with elimination but in elimination what did we go to add 6

413
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:23,620
所以总的来说，如果我们必须在这里进行分析，我们就不要停止，我们必须


414
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:30,260
所以总的来说，如果我们必须在这里进行分析，我们就不要停止，我们必须
so to sum it all right if we must analyze it here we don't stop we must

415
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:30,270
所以总的来说，如果我们必须在这里进行分析，我们就不要停止，我们必须
analyze it here we don't stop we must okay the terms that involve x5 obviously

416
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:37,019
好吧，涉及到x5的术语显然是原始的
analyze it here we don't stop we must okay the terms that involve x5 obviously

417
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:38,549
好吧，涉及到x5的术语显然是原始的
okay the terms that involve x5 obviously there was this term from the original

418
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:38,559
好吧，涉及到x5的术语显然是原始的
there was this term from the original distribution times this new potentially

419
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,100
分布乘以这个新的潜在值六倍，因此这里的三个参数
there was this term from the original distribution times this new potentially

420
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,490
分布乘以这个新的潜在值六倍，因此这里的三个参数
distribution times this new potentially six so again the three arguments here

421
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:44,500
分布乘以这个新的潜在值六倍，因此这里的三个参数
six so again the three arguments here are three and few so that we will get a

422
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,380
是三个而只有三个，所以我们将得到一个称为H的新功能5
six so again the three arguments here are three and few so that we will get a

423
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,720
是三个而只有三个，所以我们将得到一个称为H的新功能5
are three and few so that we will get a new function that is called H five

424
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:48,730
是三个而只有三个，所以我们将得到一个称为H的新功能5
new function that is called H five because five is eliminated affects to

425
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,730
因为消除了五个影响将三个结合起来，那么我们需要消除
new function that is called H five because five is eliminated affects to

426
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,890
因为消除了五个影响将三个结合起来，那么我们需要消除
because five is eliminated affects to combine three then we need to eliminate

427
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:52,900
因为消除了五个影响将三个结合起来，那么我们需要消除
combine three then we need to eliminate on with much margin export this function

428
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,149
在大量保证金出口的情况下，让我们看看我们需要我们所说的
combine three then we need to eliminate on with much margin export this function

429
00:17:57,149 --> 00:18:00,720
在大量保证金出口的情况下，让我们看看我们需要我们所说的
on with much margin export this function would be let's see we need what we said

430
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:00,730
在大量保证金出口的情况下，让我们看看我们需要我们所说的
would be let's see we need what we said to do it on Expo right so this function

431
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:06,720
在世博会上做，所以这个功能很好地发挥了所有律师的作用。
would be let's see we need what we said to do it on Expo right so this function

在世博会上做，所以这个功能很好地发挥了所有律师的作用。
well playing it all attorney this blue thing that you see here all right so

434
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,889
您在这里看到的东西很好，所以这将是X的函数，仅
well playing it all attorney this blue thing that you see here all right so

435
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,870
您在这里看到的东西很好，所以这将是X的函数，仅
thing that you see here all right so this would be a function of X to only

436
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:12,880
您在这里看到的东西很好，所以这将是X的函数，仅
this would be a function of X to only which is H porn effective then we need

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,680
这是H色情有效的影片，那么我们需要大量选择三个
this would be a function of X to only which is H porn effective then we need

438
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,240
这是H色情有效的影片，那么我们需要大量选择三个
which is H porn effective then we need to much my selects three which will

439
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,250
这是H色情有效的影片，那么我们需要大量选择三个
to much my selects three which will involve this argument last this function

440
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,210
涉及此参数最后一个函数H五个这是您在这里看到的
to much my selects three which will involve this argument last this function

441
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:27,149
涉及此参数最后一个函数H五个这是您在这里看到的
involve this argument last this function H five this is what you see here this is

00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:27,159
涉及此参数最后一个函数H五个这是您在这里看到的
H five this is what you see here this is a three of x1 and x2 then we need to

443
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:31,139
x1和x2的三个，那么我们需要在x2上最大化具有XQ的所有内容
H five this is what you see here this is a three of x1 and x2 then we need to

00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:40,390
这是到第三阶段的x点时间，我们将此函数称为a到x one
three we call this function a to x one and then we're vision because we only

449
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,990
然后我们就是愿景，因为我们只有x1的函数，我们可以将其最大化

与消除算法没什么大不了的
there is nothing very different from the elimination algorithm okay

460
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,360
这里有些东西什么也没说，所以我们
there is nothing very different from the elimination algorithm okay

461

545
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,930
但是要找到额外的商店来做这项工作，我们必须倒退，所以我们现在

546
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:20,940
但是要找到额外的商店来做这项工作，我们必须倒退，所以我们现在
we have to go backwards right so we now have to go and say you know what

547
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,060
必须说您知道我们知道X 2将最大化
we have to go backwards right so we now have to go and say you know what

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:30,960
对于每个X 1，但是我们知道X 1，所以这将为您提供适当的X 2和
this will give you the proper X 2 and then he worked here in second awhat to

553
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,560
然后他第二次在这里工作为了做到这一点，我需要知道X 1
this will give you the proper X 2 and then he worked here in second awhat to

554
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,690
然后他第二次在这里工作为了做到这一点，我需要知道X 1
then he worked here in second awhat to do this maximization I need to know X 1

555
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:35,700
然后他第二次在这里工作为了做到这一点，我需要知道X 1
do this maximization I need to know X 1 and so in between X 1 and you connect

556
00:24:35,700 --> 00:25:16,490
因此，在X 1之间，您将它们连接在一起不会产生什么影响
do this maximization I need to know X 1 and so in between X 1 and you connect

557
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,740
因此，在X 1之间，您将它们连接在一起不会产生什么影响
and so in between X 1 and you connect them together what is not going to make

558
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:18,750
因此，在X 1之间，您将它们连接在一起不会产生什么影响

go forward we go from the links to the route

583
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:02,650
我们基本上从链接到路线去找到最大值，但是
go forward we go from the links to the route

584
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,590
我们基本上从链接到路线去找到最大值，但是
we go from the links to the route basically to find the maximum but to

585
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:05,600
我们基本上从链接到路线去找到最大值，但是
basically to find the maximum but to find the x that leads to a maximum we

586
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
找到导致最大值的x，我们必须倒退，所以有一个
basically to find the maximum but to find the x that leads to a maximum we

587
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,520
找到导致最大值的x，我们必须倒退，所以有一个
find the x that leads to a maximum we have to go backwards so there is a

588
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:09,530
找到导致最大值的x，我们必须倒退，所以有一个
have to go backwards so there is a forward calculation is a powerful

654
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:52,800
您不会消除它，但是您认为还可以，因此对于此值
okay so for the possible values of this you need need to keep track what is the

655
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,300
您需要跟踪什么是最大化您的价值XI好的，然后
okay so for the possible values of this you need need to keep track what is the

00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,110
您需要跟踪什么是最大化您的价值XI好的，然后
you need need to keep track what is the maximize your value X I okay and then

657
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:00,120
您需要跟踪什么是最大化您的价值XI好的，然后
maximize your value X I okay and then when units eventually the root and you

658
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,790
当单位最终成为根并计算实际音符时，最大化
maximize your value X I okay and then when units eventually the root and you

663
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,000
当您倒退时可以得到的最终潜力可以计算
you go backwards and you can calculate the remaining of the

664
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,040
剩下的，所以这不仅是声音不错，而且
you go backwards and you can calculate the remaining of the

665
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,380
剩下的，所以这不仅是声音不错，而且
the remaining of the so this is not solely the sound good but

666
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:18,390
剩下的，所以这不仅是声音不错，而且
so this is not solely the sound good but basically what I described

667
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:22,190
基本上是我所描述的
so this is not solely the sound good but basically what I described

668
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,580
因此，实际上，如果您认为这是一个计算和神秘主义，
so this is not solely the sound good but basically what I described

669
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:24,590
因此，实际上，如果您认为这是一个计算和神秘主义，


670
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:32,150
因此，实际上，如果您认为这是一个计算和神秘主义，
so actually we the the calculations and the mysticism if you think of this as a

671
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,160
因此，实际上，如果您认为这是一个计算和神秘主义，
the mysticism if you think of this as a message passing algorithm it looks

672
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,230
消息传递算法，它看起来与我们为
the mysticism if you think of this as a message passing algorithm it looks

673
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,130
消息传递算法，它看起来与我们为

719
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:31,550
三个中立的地位的地下室说，好吧，我需要得到
neutralizing it said okay I need to get back the XJ right so we find the match

720
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:37,300
向右退XJ，所以我们找到要移到此处的匹配项，因此我们计算出
neutralizing it said okay I need to get back the XJ right so we find the match

721
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,840
向右退XJ，所以我们找到要移到此处的匹配项，因此我们计算出
back the XJ right so we find the match to move here so we compute the XJ that

722
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:39,850
向右退XJ，所以我们找到要移到此处的匹配项，因此我们计算出
to move here so we compute the XJ that maximizes this alright but we need to

723
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,480
最大限度地提高此功能，但我们需要根据XI通知找到它
to move here so we compute the XJ that maximizes this alright but we need to

724
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:50,830
最大限度地提高此功能，但我们需要根据XI通知找到它
maximizes this alright but we need to find this as a function of X I notice

725
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:50,840
最大限度地提高此功能，但我们需要根据XI通知找到它
find this as a function of X I notice from children effects and then who is

726
00:31:50,840 --> 00:32:40,570
从儿童效果开始，然后这又是谁呢，又往下走了一步
find this as a function of X I notice from children effects and then who is

727
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:43,240
从儿童效果开始，然后这又是谁呢，又往下走了一步
from children effects and then who is this the bound and one step further down

728
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:43,250
从儿童效果开始，然后这又是谁呢，又往下走了一步
this the bound and one step further down and we were to compute basically both

729
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,670
我们基本上要计算两个出口，至少到
this the bound and one step further down and we were to compute basically both

730
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:49,990
我们基本上要计算两个出口，至少到
and we were to compute basically both the exits up to at least the point is

731
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,000
我们基本上要计算两个出口，至少到
the exits up to at least the point is right if you calculate the X J's don't

732
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,750
对，如果您计算出X J不会使整个运动量最大化
the exits up to at least the point is right if you calculate the X J's don't

00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,240
对，如果您计算出X J不会使整个运动量最大化
right if you calculate the X J's don't maximize this whole bunch of exercise

734
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:58,250
对，如果您计算出X J不会使整个运动量最大化
maximize this whole bunch of exercise all right and unique need to keep track

735
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,400
正确和独特的需求，使我的电池地图一无所获，因为

00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,310
正确和独特的需求，使我的电池地图一无所获，因为
all right and unique need to keep track nothing about maps my batteries because

737
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:03,320
正确和独特的需求，使我的电池地图一无所获，因为
nothing about maps my batteries because you will need to do this message passing

738
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,140
您将需要为此算法传递大量的消息，而且
nothing about maps my batteries because you will need to do this message passing

739
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,990
您将需要为此算法传递大量的消息，而且
you will need to do this message passing on this much for that algorithm but also

740
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
您将需要为此算法传递大量的消息，而且
on this much for that algorithm but also you need to keep values of the optimal

741
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,940
您需要为其XI的参与​​债券保持最佳口味的价值
on this much for that algorithm but also you need to keep values of the optimal

742
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,370
您需要为其XI的参与​​债券保持最佳口味的价值
you need to keep values of the optimal taste for its participant bonds of X I

743
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:12,380
您需要为其XI的参与​​债券保持最佳口味的价值
taste for its participant bonds of X I you need this until you get to root this

744
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,850
您需要此，直到您扎根，这是由于
taste for its participant bonds of X I you need this until you get to root this

745
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,890
您需要此，直到您扎根，这是由于
you need this until you get to root this is where this bullet changed because of

746
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:17,900
您需要此，直到您扎根，这是由于
is where this bullet changed because of the work you will know what X is and

747
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,810
您将知道X是什么，然后您就可以标记和计算所有
is where this bullet changed because of the work you will know what X is and

748
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,910
您将知道X是什么，然后您就可以标记和计算所有
the work you will know what X is and then you can mark and compute all the

749
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:21,920
您将知道X是什么，然后您就可以标记和计算所有
then you can mark and compute all the other exit

750
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,340
其他出口
then you can mark and compute all the other exit

751
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,460
好的，您必须再次执行此操作，因为如果
then you can mark and compute all the other exit

752
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:26,470
好的，您必须再次执行此操作，因为如果


753
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:33,849
好的，您必须再次执行此操作，因为如果
all right again you have to do this because the if

754
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:33,859
好的，您必须再次执行此操作，因为如果
again you have to do this because the if you start selecting among them the sum

755
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:37,419
您开始选择其中最大的X J的总和
again you have to do this because the if you start selecting among them the sum

756
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:40,419
您开始选择其中最大的X J的总和
you start selecting among them the sum of the X J's that maximize this for

757
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:40,429
您开始选择其中最大的X J的总和
of the X J's that maximize this for whatever xre you're not going to get a

758
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:42,339
不管什么Xre，您基本上都不会获得一致的解决方案，所以您得到了
of the X J's that maximize this for whatever xre you're not going to get a

759
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:44,229
不管什么Xre，您基本上都不会获得一致的解决方案，所以您得到了
whatever xre you're not going to get a consistent solution basically so you get

760
00:33:44,229 --> 00:33:44,239
不管什么Xre，您基本上都不会获得一致的解决方案，所以您得到了
consistent solution basically so you get the wrong solution and if I can show you

761
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:48,279
错误的解决方案，如果我可以向您展示这个问题，请抓住一些核心
consistent solution basically so you get the wrong solution and if I can show you

762
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:51,339
错误的解决方案，如果我可以向您展示这个问题，请抓住一些核心
the wrong solution and if I can show you this actually please to grab some core

763
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:51,349
错误的解决方案，如果我可以向您展示这个问题，请抓住一些核心
this actually please to grab some core I'm going to come back to this right so

764
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:55,329
我要回到这个正确的位置
this actually please to grab some core I'm going to come back to this right so

765
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:56,729
你知道如果你有一个马尔可夫链，你知道额外的可以说三个
this actually please to grab some core I'm going to come back to this right so

766
00:33:56,729 --> 00:33:56,739
你知道如果你有一个马尔可夫链，你知道额外的可以说三个


767
00:33:56,739 --> 00:34:05,229
你知道如果你有一个马尔可夫链，你知道额外的可以说三个
you know if you have a Markov chain and you know extra let's say can take three

768
00:34:05,229 --> 00:34:05,239
你知道如果你有一个马尔可夫链，你知道额外的可以说三个
you know extra let's say can take three five or six you can take three values

769
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:06,729
五或六个，您可以取三个值，以此类推xn xn加1，所以这是一个
you know extra let's say can take three five or six you can take three values

770
00:34:06,729 --> 00:34:13,539
五或六个，您可以取三个值，以此类推xn xn加1，所以这是一个
five or six you can take three values etcetera xn xn plus 1 so this is one

771
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:13,549
五或六个，您可以取三个值，以此类推xn xn加1，所以这是一个
etcetera xn xn plus 1 so this is one possible this is another possible part

772
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:15,940
可能这是另一个可能的部分，对，这是最优值，然后
etcetera xn xn plus 1 so this is one possible this is another possible part

773
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:26,919
可能这是另一个可能的部分，对，这是最优值，然后
possible this is another possible part right this is the optimal value and then

774
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:26,929
可能这是另一个可能的部分，对，这是最优值，然后
right this is the optimal value and then basically from there you find what is

775
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:30,039
基本上从那里您会找到对应的先前值
right this is the optimal value and then basically from there you find what is

776
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:32,589
基本上从那里您会找到对应的先前值
basically from there you find what is the corresponding previous value for

777
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:32,599
基本上从那里您会找到对应的先前值
the corresponding previous value for that value there is no and from there

778
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:35,109
该值不存在，并且从那里具有xn的对应值，并且
the corresponding previous value for that value there is no and from there

779
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:37,329
该值不存在，并且从那里具有xn的对应值，并且
that value there is no and from there with the corresponding value of xn and

780
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:37,339
该值不存在，并且从那里具有xn的对应值，并且
with the corresponding value of xn and then xn minus 1 so basically you will

781
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:39,700
然后xn减去1，所以基本上您会发现
with the corresponding value of xn and then xn minus 1 so basically you will

782
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,889
然后xn减去1，所以基本上您会发现
then xn minus 1 so basically you will find which is the consisting the

783
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:41,899
然后xn减去1，所以基本上您会发现
find which is the consisting the consistent part that gives you

784
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:43,980
一致的零件，可以使关节最大化
find which is the consisting the consistent part that gives you

785
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,470
一致的零件，可以使关节最大化
consistent part that gives you maximization of the joint

786
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:48,590
再次，这是您需要编程的一些小事情之一
consistent part that gives you maximization of the joint

787
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:48,600
再次，这是您需要编程的一些小事情之一


788
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,010
再次，这是您需要编程的一些小事情之一
again this is one of this little things right that you need to have to program

789
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:53,020
再次，这是您需要编程的一些小事情之一
right that you need to have to program the state in action alright and what is

790
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,950
运行中的状态还不错，这里有趣的是算法
right that you need to have to program the state in action alright and what is

791
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:59,730
运行中的状态还不错，这里有趣的是算法
the state in action alright and what is interesting here is again the algorithm

792
00:34:59,730 --> 00:34:59,740
运行中的状态还不错，这里有趣的是算法
interesting here is again the algorithm gives you the impression to start with

793
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,140
给您以开始的印象，但是您只能通过以下方式将其最大化
interesting here is again the algorithm gives you the impression to start with

794
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,960
给您以开始的印象，但是您只能通过以下方式将其最大化
gives you the impression to start with but you can only you can maximize it by

795
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:03,970
给您以开始的印象，但是您只能通过以下方式将其最大化
but you can only you can maximize it by a forward calculation but to figure out

796
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,570
前向计算，但要弄清楚参数，但要最大化
but you can only you can maximize it by a forward calculation but to figure out

797
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:11,340
前向计算，但要弄清楚参数，但要最大化
a forward calculation but to figure out the the argument the extras but maximize

798
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:11,350
前向计算，但要弄清楚参数，但要最大化
the the argument the extras but maximize jointly the join you have to do the

799
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:14,070
联合，您还必须执行Marquart算法，这就是
the the argument the extras but maximize jointly the join you have to do the

800
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,350
联合，您还必须执行Marquart算法，这就是
jointly the join you have to do the Marquart algorithm as well and that's

801
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:16,360
联合，您还必须执行Marquart算法，这就是
Marquart algorithm as well and that's what this is all about let me see and

802
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:24,720
这是怎么回事，让我看看，我将从我们那里取下来
Marquart algorithm as well and that's what this is all about let me see and

803
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,950
这是怎么回事，让我看看，我将从我们那里取下来
what this is all about let me see and I'm going to pick it up from where we

804
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:25,960
这是怎么回事，让我看看，我将从我们那里取下来
I'm going to pick it up from where we left it

805
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,670
离开它，所以基本上您会注意到
I'm going to pick it up from where we left it

806
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:36,150
离开它，所以基本上您会注意到
left it so basically you notice that from the

807
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,160
离开它，所以基本上您会注意到
so basically you notice that from the previous comics let's say and I'm not

808
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,490
以前的漫画让我们说，我不确定您是否知道这可能会出现
so basically you notice that from the previous comics let's say and I'm not

809
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,530
以前的漫画让我们说，我不确定您是否知道这可能会出现
previous comics let's say and I'm not sure you know maybe this will come in

810
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:40,540
以前的漫画让我们说，我不确定您是否知道这可能会出现
sure you know maybe this will come in the next clock work but the clever

811
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,240
下一个时钟工作，但我们知道一个聪明的程序，多
sure you know maybe this will come in the next clock work but the clever

下一个时钟工作，但我们知道一个聪明的程序，多
the next clock work but the clever program that we you know the multi

813
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:48,250
下一个时钟工作，但我们知道一个聪明的程序，多
program that we you know the multi rejection inspector you can okay working

814
00:35:48,250 --> 00:36:24,750
拒绝检查器，您可以按照我们已经看到的方式处理邮件

with messages the way we have seen before

817
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,790
前
with messages the way we have seen before

818
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,859
显示通知，然后变成添加项，算法变得越来越多
with messages the way we have seen before

00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:30,869
显示通知，然后变成添加项，算法变得越来越多


820
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:35,790
显示通知，然后变成添加项，算法变得越来越多
shows notifications then become additions and the algorithm becomes much

821
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:35,800
显示通知，然后变成添加项，算法变得越来越多
additions and the algorithm becomes much time and relation that this is working

822
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,310
如果您试图最大程度地利用
additions and the algorithm becomes much time and relation that this is working

823
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,880
如果您试图最大程度地利用
time and relation that this is working is basically if you try to maximize the

824
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:41,890
如果您试图最大程度地利用
is basically if you try to maximize the joint of the effect with respect to X

825
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,670
关于X的效果的关节，您花了很长时间，这是相同的
is basically if you try to maximize the joint of the effect with respect to X

826
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,410
关于X的效果的关节，您花了很长时间，这是相同的
joint of the effect with respect to X and you take the long this is the same

827
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:46,420
关于X的效果的关节，您花了很长时间，这是相同的
and you take the long this is the same as much rising with respect X the log of

828
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,650
相对于X上升X的P的对数
and you take the long this is the same as much rising with respect X the log of

相对于X上升X的P的对数
as much rising with respect X the log of P of X

830
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:51,150
相对于X上升X的P的对数
P of X which most defining eggs to be able to

831
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:55,339
如果我定义H为
P of X which most defining eggs to be able to

832
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:59,000
如果我定义H为
which most defining eggs to be able to the masses it's alright if I define H to

833
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,010
如果我定义H为
the masses it's alright if I define H to be the lots of the messages this is how

834
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,980
是很多消息，这就是算法的样子，所以
the masses it's alright if I define H to be the lots of the messages this is how

835
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,710
是很多消息，这就是算法的样子，所以
be the lots of the messages this is how the algorithm looks like okay so the

836
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:03,720
是很多消息，这就是算法的样子，所以
the algorithm looks like okay so the name of the message from JP y por el

837
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,019
目标是JP y节日信息的消息名称
the algorithm looks like okay so the name of the message from JP y por el

838

00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:15,100
如果您想将信息从要素发送到
to send a message from a factor to a node potential if you take all the

963
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,780
如果您将所有消息从所有
to send a message from a factor to a node potential if you take all the

964
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,280
如果您将所有消息从所有
node potential if you take all the messages to derive from all the

965
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:20,290
如果您将所有消息从所有
messages to derive from all the neighbors of the factor except at that

966
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:25,200
该因子的邻居（除了到达该因子的因子之外）与它们相乘
messages to derive from all the neighbors of the factor except at that

967
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,570
该因子的邻居（除了到达该因子的因子之外）与它们相乘
neighbors of the factor except at that arrived to the factor you multiply them

968
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:27,580
该因子的邻居（除了到达该因子的因子之外）与它们相乘
arrived to the factor you multiply them and then you have you basically

969
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,080
然后您基本上就消除了集成x12的麻烦，
arrived to the factor you multiply them and then you have you basically

970
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,420
然后您基本上就消除了集成x12的麻烦，
and then you have you basically eliminate you integrate our x12 except

971
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:33,430
然后您基本上就消除了集成x12的麻烦，
eliminate you integrate our x12 except all the nodes are involved in the fact

972
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:36,840
事实涉及的所有节点现在都可以接受，所以立即
eliminate you integrate our x12 except all the nodes are involved in the fact

973
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,980

all the nodes are involved in the fact will accept nowadays okay so instantly

974
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:40,990
事实涉及的所有节点现在都可以接受，所以立即
will accept nowadays okay so instantly if you wanted to find the message and

975
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,290
如果您想查找消息，现在考虑因素
will accept nowadays okay so instantly if you wanted to find the message and

976
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,750

is the message that central that no that step of course the factor of pest so you

980
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:54,120
这是一个很重要的信息，那就是没有那一步当然是有害生物的因素
step of course the factor of pest so you might have been of incoming messages and

981
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,090
可能是收到的邮件，您与之抗争的因素是s，所以
step of course the factor of pest so you might have been of incoming messages and

982
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,580
可能是收到的邮件，您与之抗争的因素是s，所以

1048
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:18,440
最大分布，它们丢失了，因此它们是相同的，因此
so from that they are the same so the message to this right is the same as the

1049
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:27,370
右边的消息与从此粒子到此节点的消息相同
so from that they are the same so the message to this right is the same as the

1181
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,010
证据在那里，你必须通过xxxx基本上阻止启动，所以
through xxxx basically block start so it's it does it separates the evidence

1182
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:13,670
是的，它会将证据与上游和下游分开，所以如果您
through xxxx basically block start so it's it does it separates the evidence

1202
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:53,880
这还+和反对-这并不重要，所以我们不在乎，所以我
important for it so we don't care so I can write this as the probability of P X

1203
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,900
可以写成PX减去给定X以及X加和的概率
important for it so we don't care so I can write this as the probability of P X

1204
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,900
可以写成PX减去给定X以及X加和的概率

00:51:59,900 --> 00:51:59,910
可以写成PX减去给定X以及X加和的概率
minus given X and the X plus and the probability of x given Y X plus alright

1206
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:02,780
给定YX加上正确的x的概率，因为X耗散了所有权利
minus given X and the X plus and the probability of x given Y X plus alright

1207
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,650
给定YX加上正确的x的概率，因为X耗散了所有权利

1208
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:06,660
给定YX加上正确的x的概率，因为X耗散了所有权利
and because X dissipates all right I can I don't need to keep the X plus

1209
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,290
我可以不用在这里保留X加号，这样的信念可以写成

00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:13,100
我可以不用在这里保留X加号，这样的信念可以写成
I can I don't need to keep the X plus here so this belief can be written as

1211
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:13,110
我可以不用在这里保留X加号，这样的信念可以写成
here so this belief can be written as the community coming from upstream

1212
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:16,550
来自上游证据的社区，这一次是

evidence and this time that is the probability coming from downstream

1215
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,350
来自下游证据的概率确定，所以这基本上是在使用

1216
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:25,760
来自下游证据的概率确定，所以这基本上是在使用

1217
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:25,770
来自下游证据的概率确定，所以这基本上是在使用
evidence ok so this is basically using Bayes rule and the fact that we have a

1218
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,280
贝叶斯规则以及我们在这里使用的耗散这一事实
evidence ok so this is basically using Bayes rule and the fact that we have a

贝叶斯规则以及我们在这里使用的耗散这一事实
Bayes rule and the fact that we have a dissipation here that I used in this

1220
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:32,840
贝叶斯规则以及我们在这里使用的耗散这一事实
dissipation here that I used in this equation it allows me to write the

1221
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:39,390
等式，它使我能够在其中写下您知道他们的信念
dissipation here that I used in this equation it allows me to write the

the belief of the you know they in this case is conditional on the evidence

1224
00:52:43,849 --> 00:52:45,520
本案以证据权为条件，但您可以想到
the belief of the you know they in this case is conditional on the evidence

1225
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,289
本案以证据权为条件，但您可以想到

幻灯片实际上已经放在网上了，我把它们放到今天就可以了，所以
the slides are up on the web actually which I put them to get today alright so

1445
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:16,589
幻灯片实际上已经放在网上了，我把它们放到今天就可以了，所以
which I put them to get today alright so there they trade their pipe so you don't

1446
01:02:16,589 --> 01:02:19,189
他们在那里交易管道，所以您不必非要我写一个问题，
which I put them to get today alright so there they trade their pipe so you don't

1447
01:02:19,189 --> 01:02:21,709
他们在那里交易管道，所以您不必非要我写一个问题，
there they trade their pipe so you don't have to I'm just writing a questions and

1448
01:02:21,709 --> 01:02:21,719
他们在那里交易管道，所以您不必非要我写一个问题，
have to I'm just writing a questions and tastes different than Jame and all of

1449
01:02:21,719 --> 01:02:24,319
口味不同于Jame，所有这些都无法复制，但是
have to I'm just writing a questions and tastes different than Jame and all of

01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:27,109
口味不同于Jame，所有这些都无法复制，但是
tastes different than Jame and all of this can't duplicate this but yet it

1451
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:27,119
口味不同于Jame，所有这些都无法复制，但是
this can't duplicate this but yet it takes so much of platform okay this is

1452
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,140
需要这么多平台，好吧，这是给那些无所事事的教授的
this can't duplicate this but yet it takes so much of platform okay this is

1453
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:31,789
需要这么多平台，好吧，这是给那些无所事事的教授的
takes so much of platform okay this is for professors who have nothing to do at

1454
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:31,799
需要这么多平台，好吧，这是给那些无所事事的教授的
for professors who have nothing to do at night to just do lots of typing of our

1455
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:34,429
晚上只需要对我们的幻灯片进行很多打字

01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:48,749
当我要求您键入作业时的感觉是正确的
homework that is the reason right when you type things you look at them and you

1464
01:02:48,749 --> 01:02:50,719
您键入内容，然后看着它们，然后再看一遍，您说出了自己的意思。

您键入内容，然后看着它们，然后再看一遍，您说出了自己的意思。
take a look again and again you say you know what doesn't look right and if it

1467
01:02:52,859 --> 01:02:55,009
知道什么看起来不对，如果看起来不对，那是不对的
take a look again and again you say you know what doesn't look right and if it

01:02:56,779 --> 01:02:56,789
知道什么看起来不对，如果看起来不对，那是不对的
doesn't look like it is not right and you can only say that when you type

1470
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:58,640
而且您只能说，当您输入这些内容时，便会喜欢
doesn't look like it is not right and you can only say that when you type

1471
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,900
而且您只能说，当您输入这些内容时，便会喜欢

1472
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:01,910
而且您只能说，当您输入这些内容时，便会喜欢
them when you do like that everything but right good or bad you know I mean

1473
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:06,459
但是无论好坏，您都知道我的意思，但是当您键入内容时，它在视觉上并没有

但是无论好坏，您都知道我的意思，但是当您键入内容时，它在视觉上并没有
but when you type it it visually doesn't look right it's most probably not right

1476
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:12,049
看起来不错，很可能是不对，好吧，任何问题都可以
but when you type it it visually doesn't look right it's most probably not right

1493
01:03:49,849 --> 01:03:49,859
通过今天的演讲以及星期二的演讲
the lecture for Tuesday one of the chapters of Michael Jordan's

1494
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:54,169
迈克尔·乔丹（Michael Jordan）的书中的一章或“交界点3（Junction 3）”基本上是最好的
the lecture for Tuesday one of the chapters of Michael Jordan's

1495
01:03:54,169 --> 01:03:56,959
迈克尔·乔丹（Michael Jordan）的书中的一章或“交界点3（Junction 3）”基本上是最好的
one of the chapters of Michael Jordan's book or Junction 3 is basically the best

1496
01:03:56,959 --> 01:03:56,969
迈克尔·乔丹（Michael Jordan）的书中的一章或“交界点3（Junction 3）”基本上是最好的
book or Junction 3 is basically the best read for the subject okay

1497
01:03:56,969 --> 01:03:59,449
读这个主题还可以，虽然很基础但是有点地址
book or Junction 3 is basically the best read for the subject okay

1498
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:03,039
读这个主题还可以，虽然很基础但是有点地址
read for the subject okay very elementary but sort of addresses

1499
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:03,049
读这个主题还可以，虽然很基础但是有点地址
very elementary but sort of addresses everything very nice

1500
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:06,559
一切都很好
very elementary but sort of addresses everything very nice

1501
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:06,720
所以这是当然的，我将通过一个例子来做这件事，以激发
very elementary but sort of addresses everything very nice

1502
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:06,730
所以这是当然的，我将通过一个例子来做这件事，以激发


1503
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:12,390
所以这是当然的，我将通过一个例子来做这件事，以激发
so it's course again I'm going to do this through an example to motivate with

1504
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:12,400
所以这是当然的，我将通过一个例子来做这件事，以激发
this through an example to motivate with the algorithm is so let's assume that we

1505
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,670
该算法是这样的，让我们假设我们有一个有向图，看起来像
this through an example to motivate with the algorithm is so let's assume that we

1506
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:18,359
该算法是这样的，让我们假设我们有一个有向图，看起来像
the algorithm is so let's assume that we have a directed graph that looks like

1507
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:18,369
该算法是这样的，让我们假设我们有一个有向图，看起来像
have a directed graph that looks like this

1508
01:04:18,369 --> 01:04:18,750
没关系，这显然不是一棵树
have a directed graph that looks like this

1509
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:20,920
没关系，这显然不是一棵树
all right obviously this is not a tree right you can see it

1510
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,200
正确，您可以看到它，我的意思是，如果它们不存在，
all right obviously this is not a tree right you can see it

1511
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,470
正确，您可以看到它，我的意思是，如果它们不存在，
right you can see it I mean if it's they are was not there

1512
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:25,480
正确，您可以看到它，我的意思是，如果它们不存在，
I mean if it's they are was not there you can claim this two three but this is

1513
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,810
您可以声称这两个三，但这不是一棵树，所以您知道我们必须看到
I mean if it's they are was not there you can claim this two three but this is

1514
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:29,490
您可以声称这两个三，但这不是一棵树，所以您知道我们必须看到
you can claim this two three but this is not a tree so you know we have to see

1515
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:29,500
您可以声称这两个三，但这不是一棵树，所以您知道我们必须看到
not a tree so you know we have to see how the this new algorithm is action 300

1516
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,460
这个新算法如何动作300将帮助我们计算ryx
not a tree so you know we have to see how the this new algorithm is action 300

1517
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:38,280
这个新算法如何动作300将帮助我们计算ryx
how the this new algorithm is action 300 will help us to calculate ryx all right

1518
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:38,290
这个新算法如何动作300将帮助我们计算ryx
will help us to calculate ryx all right so what we're gonna need is I'm gonna

1519
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:40,800
所以我们需要的是，我将带您完成整个流程，所以我
will help us to calculate ryx all right so what we're gonna need is I'm gonna

1520
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,130
所以我们需要的是，我将带您完成整个流程，所以我
so what we're gonna need is I'm gonna take you through the process okay so I

1521
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:44,140
所以我们需要的是，我将带您完成整个流程，所以我
take you through the process okay so I notice here so I'm going to convert this

1522
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:47,490
注意这里，所以我将把它转换成无向图，正如我们所拥有的
take you through the process okay so I notice here so I'm going to convert this

1523
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:49,980
注意这里，所以我将把它转换成无向图，正如我们所拥有的
notice here so I'm going to convert this to an undirected graph and as we have

1524
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:49,990
注意这里，所以我将把它转换成无向图，正如我们所拥有的
to an undirected graph and as we have seen before the the first step is to

1525
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:54,390
第一步之前看到的基本上是道德化，x5是平衡
to an undirected graph and as we have seen before the the first step is to

1526
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,340
第一步之前看到的基本上是道德化，x5是平衡
seen before the the first step is to moralize basically and x5 is to balance

1527
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:56,350
第一步之前看到的基本上是道德化，x5是平衡
moralize basically and x5 is to balance so we wanna lies that we get an

1528
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:58,290
所以我们想撒谎，我们得到一个无向图，看起来像那样
moralize basically and x5 is to balance so we wanna lies that we get an

1529
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:01,650
所以我们想撒谎，我们得到一个无向图，看起来像那样
so we wanna lies that we get an undirected graph that looks like that

1530
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:03,570
我们要说的是，我们要为此选择一个消除顺序
so we wanna lies that we get an undirected graph that looks like that

1531
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:03,580
我们要说的是，我们要为此选择一个消除顺序


1532
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:08,430
我们要说的是，我们要为此选择一个消除顺序
we are going to say we're going to select an elimination order of this

1533
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:08,440
我们要说的是，我们要为此选择一个消除顺序
select an elimination order of this graph and we're going to keep that

1534
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:12,090
图，我们将基本上保留消除板和
select an elimination order of this graph and we're going to keep that

1535
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:16,370
图，我们将基本上保留消除板和
graph and we're going to keep that basically of the elimination plate and

1536
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:16,380
图，我们将基本上保留消除板和
basically of the elimination plate and we're going to pry interpretation we

1537
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:41,250
我们将撬开解释，我们将消除点击通勤，因此
basically of the elimination plate and we're going to pry interpretation we

1538
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:44,820
我们将撬开解释，我们将消除点击通勤，因此
we're going to pry interpretation we commute elimination clicks so this

1539
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:44,830
我们将撬开解释，我们将消除点击通勤，因此
commute elimination clicks so this elimination cliques or the junction

1540
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:49,980
消灭集团或基本上将要进入的第三个交界处
commute elimination clicks so this elimination cliques or the junction

1541
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,070
消灭集团或基本上将要进入的第三个交界处
elimination cliques or the junction three that are going basically to

1542
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:53,080
消灭集团或基本上将要进入的第三个交界处
three that are going basically to contain the function the factors

1543
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,640
包含功能与我们消除夹相关的因素
three that are going basically to contain the function the factors

1544
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,030
包含功能与我们消除夹相关的因素
contain the function the factors affiliated with our elimination clips we

1545
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:00,040
包含功能与我们消除夹相关的因素
affiliated with our elimination clips we will see this on this particular example

1546
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:04,050
在这个特定的例子中会看到这一点
affiliated with our elimination clips we will see this on this particular example

1547
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:08,880
所以这就是我们做对的事情
affiliated with our elimination clips we will see this on this particular example

1548
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:08,890
所以这就是我们做对的事情


1549
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:14,170
所以这就是我们做对的事情
so this is that what we got right

1550
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,130
穆罕默德以某种方式出现在上一张幻灯片上，我将连接节点X 2
so this is that what we got right

1551
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:15,140
穆罕默德以某种方式出现在上一张幻灯片上，我将连接节点X 2


1552
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:20,410
穆罕默德以某种方式出现在上一张幻灯片上，我将连接节点X 2
that somehow Muhammad is on the previous slide and I'm going to connect nodes X 2

1553
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:20,420
穆罕默德以某种方式出现在上一张幻灯片上，我将连接节点X 2
slide and I'm going to connect nodes X 2 and X 3 this is what I am saying I'm

1554
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:24,550
和X 3这就是我所说的，我要对它进行三角剖分
slide and I'm going to connect nodes X 2 and X 3 this is what I am saying I'm

1555
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:27,400
和X 3这就是我所说的，我要对它进行三角剖分
and X 3 this is what I am saying I'm calling it I'm going to triangulate the

1556
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:27,410
和X 3这就是我所说的，我要对它进行三角剖分
calling it I'm going to triangulate the glass and can you just potentially why

1557
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:31,240
玻璃杯，您能潜在地解释为什么我基本上需要预先点击吗？
calling it I'm going to triangulate the glass and can you just potentially why

1558
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:38,530
玻璃杯，您能潜在地解释为什么我基本上需要预先点击吗？
glass and can you just potentially why basically I need to premonition clicks

1559
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:38,540
玻璃杯，您能潜在地解释为什么我基本上需要预先点击吗？
basically I need to premonition clicks so somebody why do you need why do I

1560
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:44,260
所以有人为什么你需要为什么我需要对图进行三角剖分
basically I need to premonition clicks so somebody why do you need why do I

1561
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:48,250
所以有人为什么你需要为什么我需要对图进行三角剖分
so somebody why do you need why do I need to triangulate the graph what

1562
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:48,260
所以有人为什么你需要为什么我需要对图进行三角剖分
need to triangulate the graph what potentially benefit may exist there you

1563
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:55,300
可能存在潜在的利益，您知道如果我一起打笔记的话，那是什么
need to triangulate the graph what potentially benefit may exist there you

1564
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:58,270
可能存在潜在的利益，您知道如果我一起打笔记的话，那是什么
potentially benefit may exist there you know if I call notes together what is

1565
01:06:58,270 --> 01:06:58,280
可能存在潜在的利益，您知道如果我一起打笔记的话，那是什么
know if I call notes together what is the you know this is a big potential

1566
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,690
您知道这是一个巨大的潜力，因为在那些毫无用处的人中，我们
know if I call notes together what is the you know this is a big potential

1567
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:03,700
您知道这是一个巨大的潜力，因为在那些毫无用处的人中，我们
the you know this is a big potential because in those for naught right so we

1568
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:03,710
您知道这是一个巨大的潜力，因为在那些毫无用处的人中，我们
because in those for naught right so we need sort of to reduce that to 3 nodes

1569
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:07,060
需要将其减少到3个节点，但要吹嘘的是
because in those for naught right so we need sort of to reduce that to 3 nodes

1570
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:09,940
需要将其减少到3个节点，但要吹嘘的是
need sort of to reduce that to 3 nodes but blowing that there is a fundamental

1571
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:09,950
需要将其减少到3个节点，但要吹嘘的是
but blowing that there is a fundamental property that I will show you one we

1572
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:11,500
我将向您展示的财产我们将在没有任何照明的情况下完成这一工作
but blowing that there is a fundamental property that I will show you one we

1573
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,140
我将向您展示的财产我们将在没有任何照明的情况下完成这一工作
property that I will show you one we complete this that without any lighting

1574
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:14,150
我将向您展示的财产我们将在没有任何照明的情况下完成这一工作
complete this that without any lighting in you're not going to be able to make

1575
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:16,060
在你将无法使结点树算法左右，所以我们
complete this that without any lighting in you're not going to be able to make

1576
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:20,500
在你将无法使结点树算法左右，所以我们
in you're not going to be able to make the junction tree algorithm or so so we

1577
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:20,510
在你将无法使结点树算法左右，所以我们
the junction tree algorithm or so so we may need to tell you when we reach the

1578
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:22,540
可能需要告诉您何时我们到达本示例的末尾，所以
the junction tree algorithm or so so we may need to tell you when we reach the

1579
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:26,740
可能需要告诉您何时我们到达本示例的末尾，所以
may need to tell you when we reach the end of this example all right so the

1580
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:26,750
可能需要告诉您何时我们到达本示例的末尾，所以
end of this example all right so the first reason is we want to reduce the

1581
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:29,740
第一个原因是我们想减少这个集团的规模，但是还有另一个
end of this example all right so the first reason is we want to reduce the

1582
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:31,660
第一个原因是我们想减少这个集团的规模，但是还有另一个
first reason is we want to reduce the size of this clique but there is another

1583
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:31,670
第一个原因是我们想减少这个集团的规模，但是还有另一个
size of this clique but there is another important aspect that we will see when

1584
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:34,060
当算法产生OK时，我们将看到的重要方面是1 2 3 1 1 2
size of this clique but there is another important aspect that we will see when

1585
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:48,490
当算法产生OK时，我们将看到的重要方面是1 2 3 1 1 2
important aspect that we will see when the algorithm produces ok is 1 2 3 1 1 2

1586
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:48,500
当算法产生OK时，我们将看到的重要方面是1 2 3 1 1 2
the algorithm produces ok is 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 ok now we're going to eliminate the

1587
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:53,230
3好的，现在我们要消除链条，让我们看看下一个节点是什么
the algorithm produces ok is 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 ok now we're going to eliminate the

1588
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:56,050
3好的，现在我们要消除链条，让我们看看下一个节点是什么
3 ok now we're going to eliminate the chain let's see what is the next node we

1589
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:56,060
3好的，现在我们要消除链条，让我们看看下一个节点是什么
chain let's see what is the next node we want to eliminate now - ok that's our

1590
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:59,260
现在要消除-好的，这是我们的订单，所以下一个消除集团是
chain let's see what is the next node we want to eliminate now - ok that's our

1591
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,660
现在要消除-好的，这是我们的订单，所以下一个消除集团是
want to eliminate now - ok that's our order so the next elimination clique is

1592
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:01,670
现在要消除-好的，这是我们的订单，所以下一个消除集团是
order so the next elimination clique is 2 3 &amp; 4 2 3 or 4 this is what we left

1593
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:05,550
2 3＆4 2 3或4这就是我们剩下的下一个淘汰集团是3 4＆5
order so the next elimination clique is 2 3 &amp; 4 2 3 or 4 this is what we left

1594
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:08,710
2 3＆4 2 3或4这就是我们剩下的下一个淘汰集团是3 4＆5
2 3 &amp; 4 2 3 or 4 this is what we left the next elimination clique is 3 4 &amp; 5

1595
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:08,720
2 3＆4 2 3或4这就是我们剩下的下一个淘汰集团是3 4＆5
the next elimination clique is 3 4 &amp; 5 so we will eliminate

1596
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,180
所以我们接下来将消除三，三，四，五
the next elimination clique is 3 4 &amp; 5 so we will eliminate

1597
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:14,320
所以我们接下来将消除三，三，四，五
so we will eliminate three so three four five the next

1598
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:14,330
所以我们接下来将消除三，三，四，五
three so three four five the next elimination will be for North Shore

1599
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:17,320
消除将是北岸，所以下周将下降五个
three so three four five the next elimination will be for North Shore

1600
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,420
消除将是北岸，所以下周将下降五个
elimination will be for North Shore so the next week would be falling five

1601
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:19,430
消除将是北岸，所以下周将下降五个
so the next week would be falling five and then I have time so the next week is

1602
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:22,360
然后我有时间，所以下周就在这边，另外还有一个
so the next week would be falling five and then I have time so the next week is

1603
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:26,410
然后我有时间，所以下周就在这边，另外还有一个
and then I have time so the next week is now side and one in addition we kept

1604
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:26,420
然后我有时间，所以下周就在这边，另外还有一个
now side and one in addition we kept track of all these plygs and I'm going

1605
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:28,840
跟踪所有这些plyg，我将摆脱存在的点击
now side and one in addition we kept track of all these plygs and I'm going

1606
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,450
跟踪所有这些plyg，我将摆脱存在的点击
track of all these plygs and I'm going to get rid of the clicks that there are

1607
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:31,460
跟踪所有这些plyg，我将摆脱存在的点击
to get rid of the clicks that there are subsets of other maximal cliques all

1608
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:33,820
其他最大派系的子集可以，所以您要保留什么
to get rid of the clicks that there are subsets of other maximal cliques all

1609
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,380
其他最大派系的子集可以，所以您要保留什么
subsets of other maximal cliques all right so what are you going to keep

1610
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:35,390
其他最大派系的子集可以，所以您要保留什么
right so what are you going to keep parked at this much more clicks one two

1611
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:38,380
停在更多的点击一二三二三四和三四有五
right so what are you going to keep parked at this much more clicks one two

1612
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:42,400
停在更多的点击一二三二三四和三四有五
parked at this much more clicks one two three two three four and three four five

1613
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,950
我将认为这是因为注释是在一位神中正确的，所以这是把戏
parked at this much more clicks one two three two three four and three four five

1614
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:43,960
我将认为这是因为注释是在一位神中正确的，所以这是把戏


1615
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:52,210
我将认为这是因为注释是在一位神中正确的，所以这是把戏
I am going to consider this as notes is in one God right so this is trick

1616
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:52,220
我将认为这是因为注释是在一位神中正确的，所以这是把戏
in one God right so this is trick this is click one two three so the notes

1617
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:54,370
这是单击一二三，因此请注意其中包含的变量
in one God right so this is trick this is click one two three so the notes

1618
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:57,460
这是单击一二三，因此请注意其中包含的变量
this is click one two three so the notes the variables that are contained in

1619
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:57,470
这是单击一二三，因此请注意其中包含的变量
the variables that are contained in notes you all are X 1 X 2 3 bottom of 63

1620
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:01,900
请注意，你们所有人都是X 1 X 2 3，是63个出口排泄物的底部4 X 5，所以现在我要
the variables that are contained in notes you all are X 1 X 2 3 bottom of 63

1621
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:05,860
请注意，你们所有人都是X 1 X 2 3，是63个出口排泄物的底部4 X 5，所以现在我要
notes you all are X 1 X 2 3 bottom of 63 export excretes 4 X 5 so now I'm going

1622
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:05,870
请注意，你们所有人都是X 1 X 2 3，是63个出口排泄物的底部4 X 5，所以现在我要
export excretes 4 X 5 so now I'm going to do is I am going to pay attention to

1623
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:10,950
要做的是我要注意您注意，我正在连接所有这些
export excretes 4 X 5 so now I'm going to do is I am going to pay attention to

1624
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:13,540
要做的是我要注意您注意，我正在连接所有这些
to do is I am going to pay attention to you notice I am connecting all of this

1625
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:13,550
要做的是我要注意您注意，我正在连接所有这些
you notice I am connecting all of this together but this is not really to me

1626
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:16,000
在一起，但这对我来说不是真的，所以我们提出了三个
you notice I am connecting all of this together but this is not really to me

1627
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,830
在一起，但这对我来说不是真的，所以我们提出了三个
together but this is not really to me and so we come up with three that

1628
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:20,840
在一起，但这对我来说不是真的，所以我们提出了三个
and so we come up with three that involves this right and that click will

1629
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:26,620
涉及这项权利，点击将随之而来，如下所示
and so we come up with three that involves this right and that click will

1630
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:30,550
涉及这项权利，点击将随之而来，如下所示
involves this right and that click will come with it as follows look at this

1631
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:30,560
涉及这项权利，点击将随之而来，如下所示
come with it as follows look at this connection here how many nodes as the

1632
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,900
在这里连接多少个节点作为剪辑步骤，你可以问多少个普通节点
come with it as follows look at this connection here how many nodes as the

1633
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:39,310
在这里连接多少个节点作为剪辑步骤，你可以问多少个普通节点
connection here how many nodes as the clip steps you can ask how many common

1634
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:39,320
在这里连接多少个节点作为剪辑步骤，你可以问多少个普通节点
clip steps you can ask how many common notes they have to come out this two

1635
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:43,750
请注意，他们必须点击两次，谁是一个，所以我们要
clip steps you can ask how many common notes they have to come out this two

1636
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:51,610
请注意，他们必须点击两次，谁是一个，所以我们要
notes they have to come out this two clicks who is one yes so we are going to

1637
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:51,620
请注意，他们必须点击两次，谁是一个，所以我们要
clicks who is one yes so we are going to design a three that has eight something

1638
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:58,510
设计一个三点，有八点可以抵抗，重量是由
clicks who is one yes so we are going to design a three that has eight something

1639
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:01,420
设计一个三点，有八点可以抵抗，重量是由
design a three that has eight something to resist and weight is accounted by how

1640
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:01,430
设计一个三点，有八点可以抵抗，重量是由
to resist and weight is accounted by how many common notes served between these

1641
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:04,150
这些最大派系之间有许多共同的注解，并且请您诚实地医治您
to resist and weight is accounted by how many common notes served between these

1642
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:07,870
这些最大派系之间有许多共同的注解，并且请您诚实地医治您
many common notes served between these maximal cliques and honestly doctor you

1643
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:07,880
这些最大派系之间有许多共同的注解，并且请您诚实地医治您
maximal cliques and honestly doctor you will believe it may will be C 1 C 2 C 3

1644
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,330
会相信可能是C 1 C 2 C 3，
maximal cliques and honestly doctor you will believe it may will be C 1 C 2 C 3

1645
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:12,790
会相信可能是C 1 C 2 C 3，
will believe it may will be C 1 C 2 C 3 and

1646
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:13,210
因为这就是我们知道的
will believe it may will be C 1 C 2 C 3 and

1647
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:13,220
因为这就是我们知道的


1648
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:27,980
因为这就是我们知道的
because this is what we okay you know

1649
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:37,510
好的
because this is what we okay you know

1650
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:37,520
好的


1651
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,580
好的
all right

1652
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:50,950
好吧，在这种情况下，显然这是
all right

1653
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:50,960
好吧，在这种情况下，显然这是


1654
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:57,320
好吧，在这种情况下，显然这是
okay so in this case obviously this is

1655
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:20,920
通常情况下，诊所和医院之间会发现一个实例的一致性
okay so in this case obviously this is

1656
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:20,930
通常情况下，诊所和医院之间会发现一个实例的一致性


1657
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:32,810
通常情况下，诊所和医院之间会发现一个实例的一致性
it's common to see one instance consistency between the clinics and in

1658
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:32,820
通常情况下，诊所和医院之间会发现一个实例的一致性
consistency between the clinics and in the way we're going to be computing

1659
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,570
如果X属于C 1和C 3，我们将要计算边际的方式
consistency between the clinics and in the way we're going to be computing

1660
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:40,550
如果X属于C 1和C 3，我们将要计算边际的方式
the way we're going to be computing marginals if X belongs to C 1 and C 3 it

1661
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:40,560
如果X属于C 1和C 3，我们将要计算边际的方式
marginals if X belongs to C 1 and C 3 it also has to belong to any other click

1662
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,280
也必须属于通过此树从c1到c3的任何其他点击，所以基本上
marginals if X belongs to C 1 and C 3 it also has to belong to any other click

1663
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:50,480
也必须属于通过此树从c1到c3的任何其他点击，所以基本上
also has to belong to any other click from c1 to c3 via this tree so basically

1664
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:50,490
也必须属于通过此树从c1到c3的任何其他点击，所以基本上
from c1 to c3 via this tree so basically we will not be able to propagate

1665
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:52,160
我们将无法将消息从c1传播到c2到c3，因为
from c1 to c3 via this tree so basically we will not be able to propagate

1666
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:57,320
我们将无法将消息从c1传播到c2到c3，因为
we will not be able to propagate messages from c1 to c2 to c3 because how

1667
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:57,330
我们将无法将消息从c1传播到c2到c3，因为
messages from c1 to c2 to c3 because how are you going to propagate messages

1668
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:58,730
当这不是功能时，您是否要传播有关x3的消息
messages from c1 to c2 to c3 because how are you going to propagate messages

1669
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:01,130
当这不是功能时，您是否要传播有关x3的消息
are you going to propagate messages about the x3 when this is not a function

1670
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:01,140
当这不是功能时，您是否要传播有关x3的消息
about the x3 when this is not a function of X 3 so this property is called the

1671
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:07,190
的X 3，所以此属性称为“运行交叉点”属性，所以如果
about the x3 when this is not a function of X 3 so this property is called the

1672
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:10,190
的X 3，所以此属性称为“运行交叉点”属性，所以如果
of X 3 so this property is called the running intersection property okay so if

1673
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:10,200
的X 3，所以此属性称为“运行交叉点”属性，所以如果
running intersection property okay so if viable is common to

1674
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:14,340
可行是常见的小费，但您会看到例如c1
running intersection property okay so if viable is common to

1675
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:17,460
可行是常见的小费，但您会看到例如c1

1794
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:39,639
这会将所有这些消息初始化为也许或某物（如果有的话），以便谁
this initialize all this messages to maybe or something if any values so who

1795
01:16:39,639 --> 01:16:39,649
这会将所有这些消息初始化为也许或某物（如果有的话），以便谁
maybe or something if any values so who cares for sending messages to all the

1796
01:16:39,649 --> 01:16:41,199
关心将消息发送到所有其他节点，然后您可以应用
maybe or something if any values so who cares for sending messages to all the

1797
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:43,000
关心将消息发送到所有其他节点，然后您可以应用
cares for sending messages to all the other nodes and then you can apply your

1798
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:43,010
关心将消息发送到所有其他节点，然后您可以应用
other nodes and then you can apply your classical Esther passing so if you have

1799
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:45,219
经典的Esther过去了，所以如果您有环路，我会制作结点树
other nodes and then you can apply your classical Esther passing so if you have

1800
01:16:45,219 --> 01:16:47,529
经典的Esther过去了，所以如果您有环路，我会制作结点树
classical Esther passing so if you have the loops the junction tree I would make

1801
01:16:47,529 --> 01:16:47,539
经典的Esther过去了，所以如果您有环路，我会制作结点树
the loops the junction tree I would make work and then lots of time works that if

1802
01:16:47,539 --> 01:16:50,139
工作，然后花费大量时间，如果您在那里设置文献，
the loops the junction tree I would make work and then lots of time works that if

1803
01:16:50,139 --> 01:16:52,299
工作，然后花费大量时间，如果您在那里设置文献，
work and then lots of time works that if you set the literature there some very

1804
01:16:52,299 --> 01:16:52,309
工作，然后花费大量时间，如果您在那里设置文献，
you set the literature there some very standard pain problems when it it pays

1805
01:16:52,309 --> 01:16:55,419
标准的疼痛问题，当它付出巨大的代价，并且不能正常工作时
you set the literature there some very standard pain problems when it it pays

1806
01:16:55,419 --> 01:16:57,189
标准的疼痛问题，当它付出巨大的代价，并且不能正常工作时
standard pain problems when it it pays drastically and it doesn't work a lot

1807
01:16:57,189 --> 01:16:57,199
标准的疼痛问题，当它付出巨大的代价，并且不能正常工作时
drastically and it doesn't work a lot okay but there's no proofs why it works

1808
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:00,540
好的，但是没有任何证据说明为什么它在工作时会起作用，但实际上会起作用，
drastically and it doesn't work a lot okay but there's no proofs why it works

1809
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:04,120
好的，但是没有任何证据说明为什么它在工作时会起作用，但实际上会起作用，
okay but there's no proofs why it works when it works but it actually works and

1810
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:04,130
好的，但是没有任何证据说明为什么它在工作时会起作用，但实际上会起作用，
when it works but it actually works and it works for arbitrary graphs and you

1811
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:07,569
它适用于任意图，您知道并且可以使其实际起作用
when it works but it actually works and it works for arbitrary graphs and you

1812
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:09,759
它适用于任意图，您知道并且可以使其实际起作用
it works for arbitrary graphs and you know and you can make it actually work

1813
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:09,769
它适用于任意图，您知道并且可以使其实际起作用
know and you can make it actually work exactly okay so 146 the slides will have

1814
01:17:09,769 --> 01:17:14,679
完全可以，所以146张幻灯片上会有一个例子，这是我们所做的另一个示例
know and you can make it actually work exactly okay so 146 the slides will have

inference algorithm is from online lecture so to make sure you have this

1823
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:30,100
讲课，所以要确保你有这个转变，好吧，只保留两个

01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:44,949
讲课，所以要确保你有这个转变，好吧，只保留两个
lecture so to make sure you have this transform you okay just reserve two

1825
01:17:44,949 --> 01:17:44,959

01:17:44,959 --> 01:17:48,639
明天有问题，所以你知道
transform you okay just reserve two problems by tomorrow so you know what

1827
01:17:48,639 --> 01:17:53,040
