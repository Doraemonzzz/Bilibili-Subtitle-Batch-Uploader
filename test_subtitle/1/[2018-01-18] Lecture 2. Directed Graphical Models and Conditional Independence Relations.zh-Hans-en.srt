00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:32,230
生物学专业的学生在做这类事情，例如，不要后悔，你知道，所以我
students in biology doing this type of things like not sorry you know so I

104
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
生物学专业的学生在做这类事情，例如，不要后悔，你知道，所以我
things like not sorry you know so I don't know if I stopped working for 20

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,020
不知道我是否停止了20分钟的生物学工作并且我点击了

不知道我是否停止了20分钟的生物学工作并且我点击了
minutes in biology and I did clicker on the slide maybe a third of humans

108
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,110
幻灯片可能有三分之一的人接触到了生物学，但这不会

110
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:42,830
幻灯片可能有三分之一的人接触到了生物学，但这不会
reached biology and that is not gonna be good right

111
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,980
一路正确指向正确的好
reached biology and that is not gonna be good right

112
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,030
一路正确指向正确的好
good right pointing all the way around okay

113
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,380

116
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:56,600
我们将开始讨论有关条件独立关系的限制
about conditional independence relations and graphs but the context of

117
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,410
和图表，但该条件的理论方面的背景
about conditional independence relations and graphs but the context of

118

theoretical aspects of this conditional independence relations not the graphs

120

122
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
独立关系而不是图表所代表的这是不纯的

you know you don't have from the stir everything ok this is if you have

132
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:38,150
一切正常，这是如果您的变量绝对显示为零
you know you don't have from the stir everything ok this is if you have

独立关系，这是对有远见的人的赞赏
appreciation of the visionary all right so look at it carefully

138
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,270
所以仔细看吧，不是x1 x2给定x1 x2
appreciation of the visionary all right so look at it carefully

139
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:55,170
所以仔细看吧，不是x1 x2给定x1 x2
so look at it carefully all right not x1 x2 given x1 x2 be given

140
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:55,180
所以仔细看吧，不是x1 x2给定x1 x2
all right not x1 x2 given x1 x2 be given x2 x1 several different positions like

141
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,900
x2 x1像这样几个不同的位置，因为例如我可以开始

142
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,430
x2 x1像这样几个不同的位置，因为例如我可以开始

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:02,440
x2 x1像这样几个不同的位置，因为例如我可以开始
that because for example I can start with x2 and the next one you will

144
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,770
如果知道x1和x3，则使用x2和下一个将会体验x3
that because for example I can start with x2 and the next one you will

如果知道x1和x3，则使用x2和下一个将会体验x3
experience x3 given you know x1 and x3 etc etc so in essence you have very

147
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,610
等等等等，所以从本质上讲，您非常推崇那些，并且在某些方面不是

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,060
进行此扩展非常昂贵，因此，如果我们有您，请对此稍作检查
so just nibble on this if we have you say K values for its variable X and you

156
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,930
说出变量X的K值，而您两个都没有，所以这需要一个

158
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
说出变量X的K值，而您两个都没有，所以这需要一个
have both no so this will require a table of the order of KT power V and

159
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,719
KT幂V的量表，这就是我们真正开始的原因
have both no so this will require a table of the order of KT power V and

160
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:46,890
KT幂V的量表，这就是我们真正开始的原因

161
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:46,900
KT幂V的量表，这就是我们真正开始的原因
this is the reason really we started probabilistic graphical models because

they significantly reduce from above course okay however this method is not

250
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
他们从上述过程中明显减少了，但是这种方法不是
course okay however this method is not very useful because each of this

251
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,830
非常有用，因为每种条件分布都取决于

非常有用，因为每种条件分布都取决于
very useful because each of this conditional distributions depends on the

253
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,030
非常有用，因为每种条件分布都取决于
conditional distributions depends on the values of all the other previous

254
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,100
所有其他先前变量的值，因此您希望能够

variables so you want to be able to do maths very sort of business in the

257
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,530
数学软件在大学软件中是非常重要的事情，所以如果您
variables so you want to be able to do maths very sort of business in the

258
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,130
数学软件在大学软件中是非常重要的事情，所以如果您
maths very sort of business in the college software plus fire so if you

259
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:58,140
数学软件在大学软件中是非常重要的事情，所以如果您
college software plus fire so if you want people mixtures and you want five

260
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,530
想要人与人之间的混合，并且想要五个模块，这些都可以作为证据
college software plus fire so if you want people mixtures and you want five

261
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,920
想要人与人之间的混合，并且想要五个模块，这些都可以作为证据

262
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:03,930
想要人与人之间的混合，并且想要五个模块，这些都可以作为证据
modules you know account for evidence and things like that you won't be able

263
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,690
而且类似的事情您将无法使用该模块进行代数
modules you know account for evidence and things like that you won't be able

264
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,960
而且类似的事情您将无法使用该模块进行代数
and things like that you won't be able to do the algebra using this module okay

265
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:08,970
而且类似的事情您将无法使用该模块进行代数
to do the algebra using this module okay but again there is more than this one we

266
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,070
但是，除了这个以外，我们还有其他的桌子，炸得不错，还有一些
to do the algebra using this module okay but again there is more than this one we

267
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,650
但是，除了这个以外，我们还有其他的桌子，炸得不错，还有一些
but again there is more than this one we have the tables nice fried this had some

268
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:15,660
但是，除了这个以外，我们还有其他的桌子，炸得不错，还有一些
have the tables nice fried this had some function alright and in this case a few

269
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,680
函数正常，在这种情况下，一旦有了它，这个矩阵就很少了
have the tables nice fried this had some function alright and in this case a few

270
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,870
函数正常，在这种情况下，一旦有了它，这个矩阵就很少了
function alright and in this case a few this matrix not many once you have it

271
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:23,880
函数正常，在这种情况下，一旦有了它，这个矩阵就很少了
this matrix not many once you have it then this could be an easy problem

272
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,850
那么在分类的背景下这可能是一个容易出现的问题
this matrix not many once you have it then this could be an easy problem

273
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,340
那么在分类的背景下这可能是一个容易出现的问题
then this could be an easy problem figure in the context of classification

274
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:28,350
那么在分类的背景下这可能是一个容易出现的问题
figure in the context of classification so what I want to do this in this course

275
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,070
所以我想在本课程中做到这一点，我们将不会做一些更好的基本操作
figure in the context of classification so what I want to do this in this course

276
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:38,360
所以我想在本课程中做到这一点，我们将不会做一些更好的基本操作
so what I want to do this in this course we won't do something better some basic

277
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,370
所以我想在本课程中做到这一点，我们将不会做一些更好的基本操作
we won't do something better some basic things probability integral syndrome

278
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,590
事物概率积分综合症
we won't do something better some basic things probability integral syndrome

279
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,150
有条件独立，所以我有1除以XY和Z可以是标量K
we won't do something better some basic things probability integral syndrome

280
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,160
有条件独立，所以我有1除以XY和Z可以是标量K


281
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:50,690
有条件独立，所以我有1除以XY和Z可以是标量K
conditional independence so I have 1 divided by XY and Z can be scalar K

282
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:50,700
有条件独立，所以我有1除以XY和Z可以是标量K
divided by XY and Z can be scalar K vector so I say that x and y are

283
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,590
向量，所以我说x和y在给定Z 1 FX 2的条件下是独立的
divided by XY and Z can be scalar K vector so I say that x and y are

284
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,590
向量，所以我说x和y在给定Z 1 FX 2的条件下是独立的
vector so I say that x and y are conditionally independent given Z 1 FX 2

285
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
向量，所以我说x和y在给定Z 1 FX 2的条件下是独立的
conditionally independent given Z 1 FX 2 the y and z is equal to B FX given C ok

286
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,220
给定C ok，y和z等于B FX，因此tom是Drive的正常现象
conditionally independent given Z 1 FX 2 the y and z is equal to B FX given C ok

287
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,020
给定C ok，y和z等于B FX，因此tom是Drive的正常现象
the y and z is equal to B FX given C ok so tom is a normal something of Drive

288
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,030
给定C ok，y和z等于B FX，因此tom是Drive的正常现象
so tom is a normal something of Drive make a difference when it comes to the

289
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,390
在x的值上有所不同okay，所以这是一种方法
so tom is a normal something of Drive make a difference when it comes to the

290
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,170
在x的值上有所不同okay，所以这是一种方法
make a difference when it comes to the value of x okay so this is one way to

291
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:11,180
在x的值上有所不同okay，所以这是一种方法
value of x okay so this is one way to I'd the traditional dependent of X for y

292
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,100
我将X的传统依存关系y y乘以Z，这很重要，这就是为什么
value of x okay so this is one way to I'd the traditional dependent of X for y

293
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,680
我将X的传统依存关系y y乘以Z，这很重要，这就是为什么
I'd the traditional dependent of X for y double Z this important that's why you

294
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:17,690
我将X的传统依存关系y y乘以Z，这很重要，这就是为什么
double Z this important that's why you say conditional because there is an

295
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,510
说有条件的，因为如果您认为现在有一个论点，或者是宇宙论
double Z this important that's why you say conditional because there is an

296
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:25,120
说有条件的，因为如果您认为现在有一个论点，或者是宇宙论
say conditional because there is an argument either now cosmas if you think

297
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,130
说有条件的，因为如果您认为现在有一个论点，或者是宇宙论
argument either now cosmas if you think this is a definition let me say the

298
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,550
这是一个定义让我说一个简单的代数对，我可以写这个
argument either now cosmas if you think this is a definition let me say the

299
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,430
这是一个定义让我说一个简单的代数对，我可以写这个
this is a definition let me say the simple algebra right I can write this

300
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
这是一个定义让我说一个简单的代数对，我可以写这个
simple algebra right I can write this more effectively y and z and then P of Y

301
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,710
y和z更有效，然后Y的P给定Z，所以这些是我可以写的
simple algebra right I can write this more effectively y and z and then P of Y

302
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,800
y和z更有效，然后Y的P给定Z，所以这些是我可以写的
more effectively y and z and then P of Y given Z so those are this I can write

303
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:35,810
y和z更有效，然后Y的P给定Z，所以这些是我可以写的
given Z so those are this I can write this as P of X given Z P of Y given C so

304
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,310
这是X的P给定的Y的ZP给定的C，所以我们可以在委员会中推进
given Z so those are this I can write this as P of X given Z P of Y given C so

305
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,370
这是X的P给定的Y的ZP给定的C，所以我们可以在委员会中推进
this as P of X given Z P of Y given C so we can advances in the Commission to

306
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:42,380
这是X的P给定的Y的ZP给定的C，所以我们可以在委员会中推进
we can advances in the Commission to life as an alternative way that when

307
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,120
生命作为一种替代方式，当这种有条件的价格分配时
we can advances in the Commission to life as an alternative way that when

308

生命作为一种替代方式，当这种有条件的价格分配时
life as an alternative way that when this conditional distribution for price

309
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:48,440
生命作为一种替代方式，当这种有条件的价格分配时
this conditional distribution for price is like knob Direction Y an independent

310
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,730
就像旋钮方向Y沿着Z方向独立执行一样，所以有时
this conditional distribution for price is like knob Direction Y an independent

311
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,630
就像旋钮方向Y沿着Z方向独立执行一样，所以有时
is like knob Direction Y an independent commission along Z okay so sometimes

312
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:55,640
就像旋钮方向Y沿着Z方向独立执行一样，所以有时
commission along Z okay so sometimes this will be convenient sometimes this

313
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,910
有时候这很方便，因为它们是完全一样的
commission along Z okay so sometimes this will be convenient sometimes this

314
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,560
有时候这很方便，因为它们是完全一样的
this will be convenient sometimes this they are exactly the same thing that's

315
00:11:59,560 --> 00:11:59,570
有时候这很方便，因为它们是完全一样的
they are exactly the same thing that's good

316
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,610
好的依赖关系也可以用随机变量集来表示，所以我们
they are exactly the same thing that's good

317
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:02,620
好的依赖关系也可以用随机变量集来表示，所以我们


318
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:20,830
好的依赖关系也可以用随机变量集来表示，所以我们
okay dependence relationship also in terms of sets of random variables so we

319
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:20,840
好的依赖关系也可以用随机变量集来表示，所以我们
terms of sets of random variables so we can either assent affection for

320
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,750
可以同意对环境的情感正在发展
terms of sets of random variables so we can either assent affection for

321
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,000
可以同意对环境的情感正在发展
can either assent affection for environments is developing once that

322
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,010
可以同意对环境的情感正在发展
environments is developing once that wagon easy when texas independent of Y

323
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,530
当得克萨斯州独立于Y时，对集合X中的每个X给出Z时，旅行车很容易

当得克萨斯州独立于Y时，对集合X中的每个X给出Z时，旅行车很容易
given Z for every X in the set X and everyone in the sidewalk okay

326
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,900
人行道上的每个人都可以，实际上Zia可以做到
given Z for every X in the set X and everyone in the sidewalk okay

328
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:39,980
人行道上的每个人都可以，实际上Zia可以做到
and actually this Zia can make it also set so I maybe that we have been even

329
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,360
设置好，所以也许现在我们已经在其中进行了更广泛的逆转
and actually this Zia can make it also set so I maybe that we have been even

330
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,050
设置好，所以也许现在我们已经在其中进行了更广泛的逆转
set so I maybe that we have been even more generalized reversals in there now

331
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,060
设置好，所以也许现在我们已经在其中进行了更广泛的逆转
more generalized reversals in there now for example we say this set of the very

332
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,910
例如，我们说这个给定的那个集是非常独立的
more generalized reversals in there now for example we say this set of the very

333
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,160
例如，我们说这个给定的那个集是非常独立的
for example we say this set of the very most is independent that given that set

334
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,170
例如，我们说这个给定的那个集是非常独立的
most is independent that given that set variable so this basically will follow

335
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,800
变量，因此这基本上将遵循此定义
most is independent that given that set variable so this basically will follow

看到你知道，用X表示抱歉，你知道这会告诉你我输入这个
you know it's gonna tell you I type this slide at least we have some slides to

377
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,710
至少我们有一些幻灯片来谈论您所知道的错误论文
you know it's gonna tell you I type this slide at least we have some slides to

379
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:13,480
至少我们有一些幻灯片来谈论您所知道的错误论文
talk about the wrong papers you know it's good idea to sort of be careful and

380
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,760
保持谨慎和一致是个好主意，因为远比您
talk about the wrong papers you know it's good idea to sort of be careful and

consistent because much than you're consistent okay so this mess intent of

383
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:27,570
一贯的好吧，所以这个有条件的和边缘的混乱意图
consistent because much than you're consistent okay so this mess intent of

384
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,370
一贯的好吧，所以这个有条件的和边缘的混乱意图
consistent okay so this mess intent of this conditional and marginal

385
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:29,380
一贯的好吧，所以这个有条件的和边缘的混乱意图
this conditional and marginal independence okay so I am saying here

386
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:37,200
独立性好，所以我在这里说，这整个时间都独立于
this conditional and marginal independence okay so I am saying here

387
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,930
独立性好，所以我在这里说，这整个时间都独立于
independence okay so I am saying here that this whole time is independent of

388
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:39,940
独立性好，所以我在这里说，这整个时间都独立于
that this whole time is independent of the type of the car okay

389
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,080
汽车的类型还可以
that this whole time is independent of the type of the car okay

390
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,230
[音乐]

[Music]

394
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:04,259
我的意思是，您知道他们说a的可能性更高，您知道我


395
00:15:04,259 --> 00:16:08,249
我的意思是，您知道他们说a的可能性更高，您知道我
I mean the you know they say the probability of a is higher is you know I

396
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:08,259
我的意思是，您知道他们说a的可能性更高，您知道我
probability of a is higher is you know I mean they you know would be exactly the

397
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,979
意味着您知道他们将与第一个示例完全相反
probability of a is higher is you know I mean they you know would be exactly the

398
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:14,150
意味着您知道他们将与第一个示例完全相反

399
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
意味着您知道他们将与第一个示例完全相反
opposite effect from the first example okay so so this is the motion again so

400
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,489
好吧，所以这又是议案，所以我们要在这里经文，你知道我在
opposite effect from the first example okay so so this is the motion again so

401
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:22,139
好吧，所以这又是议案，所以我们要在这里经文，你知道我在
okay so so this is the motion again so we're gonna verse here you know I'm

402
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:22,149
好吧，所以这又是议案，所以我们要在这里经文，你知道我在
we're gonna verse here you know I'm writing this is a standard are gonna

403
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:26,879
写这是一个标准，实际上要花两三堂课
we're gonna verse here you know I'm writing this is a standard are gonna

404
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,229
写这是一个标准，实际上要花两三堂课
writing this is a standard are gonna spend actually two or three lectures

405
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:28,239
写这是一个标准，实际上要花两三堂课
spend actually two or three lectures discussing about this kindle market or

408
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:35,049
讨论这种点燃市场或州立公园庄园州立空间
in the State Park Estate state-space models but this is a Markov chain so we

409
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:39,569
模型，但这是一个马尔可夫链，所以我们可以想像您知道您有某种状态

身体移动，但是你知道它的价值
of it Connie so x1 is the volume of dynomonics

415
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,650
康妮，所以x1是重音的音量-谢谢，等等，所以异常
of it Connie so x1 is the volume of dynomonics

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:02,770
这里的单项式假设中，高BP的模型效应仅取决于
effects of high BP depends only on the value of I'm XT minus 1 so prepared this

421
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,030
我的值是XT减去1，所以准备这个表达式可以特别显示出
effects of high BP depends only on the value of I'm XT minus 1 so prepared this

422
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,120
我的值是XT减去1，所以准备这个表达式可以特别显示出
value of I'm XT minus 1 so prepared this expression show expecially we can

423
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,130
我的值是XT减去1，所以准备这个表达式可以特别显示出
expression show expecially we can remember this pretty does this long

424
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,800
还记得这个漂亮的长表达式吗？

还记得这个漂亮的长表达式吗？
remember this pretty does this long expression compared list right with this

426
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:16,510
还记得这个漂亮的长表达式吗？
expression compared list right with this Markovian model that is very simplified

427
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,980
马尔可夫模型非常简化，因为额外模型不依赖于XT减

429
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:23,680
马尔可夫模型非常简化，因为额外模型不依赖于XT减
because extra doesn't depend on XT minus 2 XT minus 3 etc ok so this is this

430
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:32,340
2 XT减3等，所以这是他们看到各种提示的时候
because extra doesn't depend on XT minus 2 XT minus 3 etc ok so this is this

431
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,500
2 XT减3等，所以这是他们看到各种提示的时候
2 XT minus 3 etc ok so this is this moment they see various cues the

432
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:34,510
2 XT减3等，所以这是他们看到各种提示的时候
moment they see various cues the independence relations in particular but

433
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,080
特别是独立性关系，但是XP中的独立性是X 2减去1
moment they see various cues the independence relations in particular but

434
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:44,280
特别是独立性关系，但是XP中的独立性是X 2减去1
independence relations in particular but XP is independent X 2 minus 1 is in the

435
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,290
特别是独立性关系，但是XP中的独立性是X 2减去1
XP is independent X 2 minus 1 is in the parent of all the various values XT

436
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,200
该课程中所有各种值的父项XT减去2 X 1
XP is independent X 2 minus 1 is in the parent of all the various values XT

437
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:58,070
该课程中所有各种值的父项XT减去2 X 1
parent of all the various values XT minus 2 X 1 on this course or something

438
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080
该课程中所有各种值的父项XT减去2 X 1
minus 2 X 1 on this course or something if I highlighted from lecture 1 which is

439
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,950
如果我在第1课中突出显示了该节点的父节点，那么在此
minus 2 X 1 on this course or something if I highlighted from lecture 1 which is

440
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,230
如果我在第1课中突出显示了该节点的父节点，那么在此
if I highlighted from lecture 1 which is the parent of the node right so in this

441
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:07,240
如果我在第1课中突出显示了该节点的父节点，那么在此
the parent of the node right so in this case if we look at no business to

442
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,540
如果我们不给父母做生意的话，那么这是一个基本
the parent of the node right so in this case if we look at no business to

443
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:16,890
如果我们不给父母做生意的话，那么这是一个基本
case if we look at no business to parents okay and so here's a fundamental

444
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,090
公平性有条件地关系了此有向图的先前关系，因此
case if we look at no business to parents okay and so here's a fundamental

445
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:17,100
公平性有条件地关系了此有向图的先前关系，因此


446
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,820
公平性有条件地关系了此有向图的先前关系，因此
fairness conditionally previous relations for this directed graph and so

447
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:22,830
公平性有条件地关系了此有向图的先前关系，因此
relations for this directed graph and so what it says x-ray is independent from

448
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,930
它所说的X射线与负片的主要部分无关
relations for this directed graph and so what it says x-ray is independent from

449
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,350
它所说的X射线与负片的主要部分无关
what it says x-ray is independent from the main the segments of a negative

450
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,360
它所说的X射线与负片的主要部分无关
the main the segments of a negative spiral so this is out there

451
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,020
螺旋形，所以这是在那里塔玛拉沟槽强调
the main the segments of a negative spiral so this is out there

452
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,760
螺旋形，所以这是在那里塔玛拉沟槽强调
spiral so this is out there Tamara trenched to emphasize the

453
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:38,770
螺旋形，所以这是在那里塔玛拉沟槽强调
Tamara trenched to emphasize the depositor given this will highlight in

454
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,010
鉴于此，存款人将在那部电影中突出显示
Tamara trenched to emphasize the depositor given this will highlight in

455
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,270
鉴于此，存款人将在那部电影中突出显示
depositor given this will highlight in that movie

456
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:42,280
鉴于此，存款人将在那部电影中突出显示
that movie alright so

457
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,680
好吧，这样的说法仍然存在，那就是
that movie alright so

458
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,410
好吧，这样的说法仍然存在，那就是
alright so the parlance it stays that the value of

459
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:47,420
好吧，这样的说法仍然存在，那就是
the parlance it stays that the value of V is independent through the name of the

460
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,660
V通过发件人的名字是独立的，因此政治上的摄影师
the parlance it stays that the value of V is independent through the name of the

461
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,920
V通过发件人的名字是独立的，因此政治上的摄影师
V is independent through the name of the sender so photographer at the political

462
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:53,930
V通过发件人的名字是独立的，因此政治上的摄影师
sender so photographer at the political order the wrong descendants will have

463
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,540
命令错误的后代将有数字，但它们基本上是

464
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,860
命令错误的后代将有数字，但它们基本上是
order the wrong descendants will have numbers but they are basically

465
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:58,870
命令错误的后代将有数字，但它们基本上是
numbers but they are basically everything about the values of the

466
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,820

468
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:04,370
关于父母价值观的一切基本上都按顺序排列
parents basically in the order okay these are the non descendants right so

469
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,300
这些是非后裔，所以要指出父母的价值观
parents basically in the order okay these are the non descendants right so

470
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,420
这些是非后裔，所以要指出父母的价值观
these are the non descendants right so point on the values of the parents

471
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:09,430
这些是非后裔，所以要指出父母的价值观
point on the values of the parents excuse you the fella from the

472
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,210
请您从非子孙后代或其他类似的事物中解雇您的小伙子

00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:06,839
反向对，这些将取一个值，而我们全取K个值
values and we're taking K values all right so okay less rough

613
00:26:06,839 --> 00:27:25,249
对，所以没那么粗糙
values and we're taking K values all right so okay less rough

614
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:26,430
是的，新西兰对敌人的纪念较少，被驳回
values and we're taking K values all right so okay less rough

dismissed mara independence relations okay and

619
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,030
玛拉独立关系还可以，这不是很有趣，所以这是
mara independence relations okay and this is not very interesting so this is

620
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,040
玛拉独立关系还可以，这不是很有趣，所以这是
this is not very interesting so this is something very just the Ascension this

621
00:27:36,040 --> 00:28:54,980
只是提升的东西，你可以体会到我所需要的

experience equal to one which is nice so obviously it's individual on

632
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,039
因此，很明显，将标准化归因于个别情况
experience equal to one which is nice so obviously it's individual on

633
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,019
因此，很明显，将标准化归因于个别情况
so obviously it's individual on normalizing expect that this will be the

don't even have to be preferable if this but right now from directed graphs this

647
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:28,680
但是现在从有向图来看就是这种情况，我说证明
don't even have to be preferable if this but right now from directed graphs this

648
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,570
但是现在从有向图来看就是这种情况，我说证明
but right now from directed graphs this is the case and I say the proof and it

649
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:33,580

right so so I don't have to go back and change the story that's already there

980
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:13,680
改变已经存在的故事，我确定每个人都回应
right so so I don't have to go back and change the story that's already there

981
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,130
改变已经存在的故事，我确定每个人都回应
change the story that's already there and I was sure that everybody responds

982
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:17,140
改变已经存在的故事，我确定每个人都回应
and I was sure that everybody responds what this equation makes or let's the

983
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,890
这个方程式是什么，或者让我们得出今天以来的相关率
and I was sure that everybody responds what this equation makes or let's the

984
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:24,270
这个方程式是什么，或者让我们得出今天以来的相关率
what this equation makes or let's the the correlation rate across today from

985
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:24,280
这个方程式是什么，或者让我们得出今天以来的相关率
the correlation rate across today from directly ghost makes a little sense

986
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,670
直接鬼是有道理的，没有别的好吧
the correlation rate across today from directly ghost makes a little sense

987
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:32,460
直接鬼是有道理的，没有别的好吧
directly ghost makes a little sense there was nothing else okay all right

988
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:38,710
所以这11个例子我想我可能要举个例子，因为
directly ghost makes a little sense there was nothing else okay all right

989
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:38,720
所以这11个例子我想我可能要举个例子，因为


990
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:46,060
所以这11个例子我想我可能要举个例子，因为
so this 11 example I think I'm gonna I may have to give this because there's

991
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,040
该示例中令人不愉快的依赖关系作为在
so this 11 example I think I'm gonna I may have to give this because there's

992
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:47,050
该示例中令人不愉快的依赖关系作为在


993
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:50,980

为此运动被告写了一点白色
Belgium to mislead Gaussian so if I wrote a little bit of white for it sex

1067
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:53,609
为此运动被告写了一点白色
wrote a little bit of white for it sex the this exercising defendant and so

1068
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:53,619
为此运动被告写了一点白色
the this exercising defendant and so effectively you know this is the problem

1069
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:56,969
实际上，您知道这是发动机呼啸而过的神性问题
the this exercising defendant and so effectively you know this is the problem

world X living who soldier sex is given Y can be factorized over the data right

1075
00:51:04,089 --> 00:51:07,469
由于可以假设X为
world X living who soldier sex is given Y can be factorized over the data right

1076
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:10,680
由于可以假设X为
Y can be factorized over the data right because of this assumption that the X is

1077
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:10,690
由于可以假设X为
because of this assumption that the X is having a fairly given Y ok so so this is

1078
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:15,209
有一个确定的Y ok，所以这是非常重要的
because of this assumption that the X is having a fairly given Y ok so so this is

1079
00:51:15,209 --> 00:51:16,910
有一个确定的Y ok，所以这是非常重要的

what happened to X 5 minus X 6 well I mean the question of attack the

1181
00:59:11,739 --> 00:59:15,700
好吧，我的意思是说，攻击的问题是黑人，当您
what happened to X 5 minus X 6 well I mean the question of attack the

well I mean the question of attack the black is words you know when you

1183
00:59:17,469 --> 00:59:17,479
好吧，我的意思是说，攻击的问题是黑人，当您
black is words you know when you somewhere X 5 and X 6 this is 0.1 of

1184
00:59:17,479 --> 00:59:20,469
在X 5和X 6处，这等于0.1等于1，所以它们消失了

somewhere X 5 and X 6 this is 0.1 of this equal to 1 so they disappear you

1186
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:24,410
在X 5和X 6处，这等于0.1等于1，所以它们消失了
this equal to 1 so they disappear you see that when you analyze to the joint

1187
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:26,859
看到当您在接下来的5分钟内分析关节时，因为这
this equal to 1 so they disappear you see that when you analyze to the joint

1188
00:59:26,859 --> 00:59:29,710
看到当您在接下来的5分钟内分析关节时，因为这
see that when you analyze to the joint the next 5 minutes because this how

1189
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:29,720
看到当您在接下来的5分钟内分析关节时，因为这
the next 5 minutes because this how conditional distinguishes the summation

1190
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,319
有条件的区分总和给人好处，所以所以这
the next 5 minutes because this how conditional distinguishes the summation

1191
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:37,870
有条件的区分总和给人好处，所以所以这
conditional distinguishes the summation is giving the advantage okay so so this

1192
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:37,880
有条件的区分总和给人好处，所以所以这
is giving the advantage okay so so this is the joint of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 and then

1193
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,049
是X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4的关节，然后如果您想加入音高1 X 2 X
is giving the advantage okay so so this is the joint of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 and then

all right yeah well this consus without this

1202
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,630
是的，没有这个概念的这种疑惑已经发展了，但是你明白了
all right yeah well this consus without this

00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,690
是的，没有这个概念的这种疑惑已经发展了，但是你明白了
yeah well this consus without this concept evolved already but you get this

1204
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:55,700
是的，没有这个概念的这种疑惑已经发展了，但是你明白了
concept evolved already but you get this perfect score given X 2 okay so this is

1205
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,019
给定X 2的完美分数，好吧，这有点满足了这种独立性关系
concept evolved already but you get this perfect score given X 2 okay so this is

1206
00:59:59,019 --> 01:00:01,019
给定X 2的完美分数，好吧，这有点满足了这种独立性关系
perfect score given X 2 okay so this is kinda filled this independence relation

1207
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:01,029
给定X 2的完美分数，好吧，这有点满足了这种独立性关系
kinda filled this independence relation but I wrestle to remember the ideas that

1208
01:00:01,029 --> 01:00:05,519
但是我努力地想起了阿萨德不在所有这些背后的想法，并说
kinda filled this independence relation but I wrestle to remember the ideas that

1209
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,200
但是我努力地想起了阿萨德不在所有这些背后的想法，并说
but I wrestle to remember the ideas that Assad isn't behind all of this and say

1210
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:08,210
但是我努力地想起了阿萨德不在所有这些背后的想法，并说
Assad isn't behind all of this and say all there is an independence relations

1211
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:09,999
一切都有独立的关系，但到天堂的所有团体
Assad isn't behind all of this and say all there is an independence relations

1212
01:00:09,999 --> 01:00:12,940
一切都有独立的关系，但到天堂的所有团体
all there is an independence relations but to heaven all the groups of this

1213
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:12,950
一切都有独立的关系，但到天堂的所有团体
but to heaven all the groups of this graph and he says this graph implies

1214
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,489
图，他说这个图不暗示这种独立关系
but to heaven all the groups of this graph and he says this graph implies

1216
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:18,650
图，他说这个图不暗示这种独立关系
none of this independence relations so whatever distribution that population

1217
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:21,339
因此，无论人口分布图是tamarkan满足的，
none of this independence relations so whatever distribution that population

1218
01:00:21,339 --> 01:00:24,039
因此，无论人口分布图是tamarkan满足的，
so whatever distribution that population the graph has been tamarkan satisfy of

1219
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:24,049
因此，无论人口分布图是tamarkan满足的，
the graph has been tamarkan satisfy of this relationship

1220
01:00:24,049 --> 01:00:25,769
这种关系还不错，所以我们不会
the graph has been tamarkan satisfy of this relationship
