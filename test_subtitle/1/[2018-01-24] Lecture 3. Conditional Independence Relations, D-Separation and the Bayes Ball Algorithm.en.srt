1
00:04:53,690 --> 00:05:00,760
all right so we're going to continue to finish up

2
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,400
so we're going to continue to finish up lecture 2 with a few basic definitions

3
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,190
lecture 2 with a few basic definitions and then discussed about this separation

4
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,100
and then discussed about this separation which is sort of the most rigorous and

5
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,270
which is sort of the most rigorous and easiest way to take independence

6
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,850
easiest way to take independence relations from on directed and

7
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,450
relations from on directed and undirected jobs so let's pick up a few

8
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,420
undirected jobs so let's pick up a few slides from lecture two so this is an

9
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,790
slides from lecture two so this is an example but I mean I hope you take ten

10
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,200
example but I mean I hope you take ten minutes for somebody to type this

11
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,630
minutes for somebody to type this equation right which means I expect me

12
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,310
equation right which means I expect me to at least spend ten minutes to

13
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,330
to at least spend ten minutes to actually a minute

14
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,880
actually a minute okay and it looks awful for everything

15
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,010
okay and it looks awful for everything trivial but there's a lot of substance

16
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,050
trivial but there's a lot of substance in terms of calculation so I'm going to

17
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,630
in terms of calculation so I'm going to carry on everywhere in the course so I

18
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,370
carry on everywhere in the course so I wanted to go through this example in a

19
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,140
wanted to go through this example in a few more details maybe you know spend a

20
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:59,080
few more details maybe you know spend a minute or two so this note is not about

21
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,500
minute or two so this note is not about sex - x3 indicate and this belong will

22
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,990
sex - x3 indicate and this belong will be the case today in the course indicate

23
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,930
be the case today in the course indicate evidence so the idea is we have observed

24
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,610
evidence so the idea is we have observed next to X 3 that's quite a mark okay and

25
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,310
next to X 3 that's quite a mark okay and what we want to prove this if we have

26
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,730
what we want to prove this if we have observed exponent 3 X 1 and X 6 are

27
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,400
observed exponent 3 X 1 and X 6 are independent okay so this but the

28
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,360
independent okay so this but the notation rates

29
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,080
notation rates so again explore extreme anthems by got

30
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,220
so again explore extreme anthems by got some evidence and I want to know now are

31
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,200
some evidence and I want to know now are given the prevalence of X 1 and X 6

32
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,470
given the prevalence of X 1 and X 6 independent okay so effectively what we

33
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,070
independent okay so effectively what we need to prove is so we need X 2 and X 3

34
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,200
need to prove is so we need X 2 and X 3 different so we need to prove now the

35
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,570
different so we need to prove now the probability of matchsticks given X 1 X 2

36
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,940
probability of matchsticks given X 1 X 2 X 3 it's equal to the probability of

37
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,850
X 3 it's equal to the probability of extreme given X 2 X 3 in other way is

38
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,610
extreme given X 2 X 3 in other way is knowing this evidence the information of

39
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,800
knowing this evidence the information of X 1 doesn't sell making you about X 6

40
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,610
X 1 doesn't sell making you about X 6 okay

41
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,620
okay and obviously this brute

42
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,880
and obviously this brute the long way but this is what we are at

43
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,040
the long way but this is what we are at the course at this point ok so where the

44
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,150
the course at this point ok so where the headband is I noticed as the joint in

45
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,980
headband is I noticed as the joint in the numerator is the joint probability

46
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,280
the numerator is the joint probability of X 1 X 2 X 3 and X 6 which means this

47
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,250
of X 1 X 2 X 3 and X 6 which means this is the total joint probability polarized

48
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,910
is the total joint probability polarized on the graph and then obviously have to

49
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,250
on the graph and then obviously have to integrate how's X 4 and X 5 all right

50
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,380
integrate how's X 4 and X 5 all right and then in the denominator have the

51
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,840
and then in the denominator have the joining of X 1 X 2 X 3 which means I

52
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,870
joining of X 1 X 2 X 3 which means I have to integrate out X 4 X 5 and X 6

53
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:36,110
have to integrate out X 4 X 5 and X 6 okay the important thing that algorithm

54
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,330
okay the important thing that algorithm that is going to save us when we work

55
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,630
that is going to save us when we work through this type of graphs is that we

56
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,340
through this type of graphs is that we can put some of these summations in

57
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,580
can put some of these summations in words so for example you have summation

58
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,620
words so for example you have summation X 5 and the only terms that depends

59
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,680
X 5 and the only terms that depends region X 5 or goes to last term so you

60
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,800
region X 5 or goes to last term so you can put X 5 the situation at this point

61
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,330
can put X 5 the situation at this point okay and then the destination in X for

62
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,430
okay and then the destination in X for this x don't depend on exposure you can

63
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,850
this x don't depend on exposure you can push destination in here but not you

64
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,760
push destination in here but not you know notice there is an X 2 there right

65
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,640
know notice there is an X 2 there right and and that will be part of destination

66
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,160
and and that will be part of destination that after forming expired all right so

67
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,930
that after forming expired all right so the summation is person X 5 then in

68
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,090
the summation is person X 5 then in export and similarly in the denominator

69
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,960
export and similarly in the denominator is the summation X 6 and X 5 then export

70
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,620
is the summation X 6 and X 5 then export it's important to this is sort of the

71
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,930
it's important to this is sort of the main trick use to allow

72
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,180
main trick use to allow rocking inconsistent overly structured

73
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,390
rocking inconsistent overly structured water a pentacle for modulation for the

74
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,870
water a pentacle for modulation for the same time good luck okay alright so a

75
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:44,300
same time good luck okay alright so a lot of the things cancel out so this may

76
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,980
lot of the things cancel out so this may because this is a condition distribution

77
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,310
because this is a condition distribution distillation

78
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,020
distillation becomes equal to 1 regardless what

79
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,620
becomes equal to 1 regardless what exteriors so this and this cancel out so

80
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,050
exteriors so this and this cancel out so basically I'm sorry business and cancel

81
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,160
basically I'm sorry business and cancel out this cut is equal to 1 this is equal

82
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,160
out this cut is equal to 1 this is equal to 1 so basically this illustris allow

83
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,620
to 1 so basically this illustris allow this

84
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,090
you know it's one anyways so I get this big donation on the numerator which is

85
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,270
big donation on the numerator which is this and then there's somebody pointed

86
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,730
this and then there's somebody pointed me just they would he came to see me he

87
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,350
me just they would he came to see me he says to me why is this equal to laughs

88
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,400
says to me why is this equal to laughs because you notice suddenly I plug in

89
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,650
because you notice suddenly I plug in Ian's in addition to extreme x2 and in

90
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,960
Ian's in addition to extreme x2 and in addition to extra x5 I plug in an

91
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:35,560
addition to extra x5 I plug in an extreme white house

92
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:35,570


93
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:42,370
so here I have X 5 given X 3 X 5 given X 3 and then I could but this is equal to

94
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:48,430
3 and then I could but this is equal to X 5 and X 3 and X 2 what property from

95
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:54,580
X 5 and X 3 and X 2 what property from the ones we say parent no I don't see a

96
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:04,050
the ones we say parent no I don't see a parent X 2 is not the power

97
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,060


98
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,280
yeah but one of the fundamental independent properties that we stated

99
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,340
independent properties that we stated and we will see three times today or

100
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:16,550
and we will see three times today or four is the given the parent the node is

101
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,260
four is the given the parent the node is independent of of the non-descendants

102
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,490
independent of of the non-descendants again the no descendants of the unjust

103
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,190
again the no descendants of the unjust was basically plus some extra notes okay

104
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:33,240
was basically plus some extra notes okay so in this case X 2 is not an ancestor

105
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,690
so in this case X 2 is not an ancestor is a lone dissenter because the only

106
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:43,440
is a lone dissenter because the only access third of X 5 is X 3 and X 1 all

107
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:43,860
access third of X 5 is X 3 and X 1 all right

108
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,770
right x2 is a non descendant so in other ways

109
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,870
x2 is a non descendant so in other ways you can see the arrows you can go from 5

110
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,650
you can see the arrows you can go from 5 to 6

111
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,140
to 6 you know what to do so XQ is a non

112
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,590
you know what to do so XQ is a non descender ok so again we will see this

113
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,660
descender ok so again we will see this property together but given the power

114
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,600
property together but given the power and X 3 this the probability of X 5 is

115
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,430
and X 3 this the probability of X 5 is independent X 5 is independent of the

116
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,220
independent X 5 is independent of the non depends on X and similarly on the

117
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,330
non depends on X and similarly on the second probability I plug in what I can

118
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,350
second probability I plug in what I can here 3 so given X 2 and X 5 2 and 5

119
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,380
here 3 so given X 2 and X 5 2 and 5 which are the parents of extinct I plug

120
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:25,230
which are the parents of extinct I plug in 3 and 3 is a what it's a you know

121
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,970
in 3 and 3 is a what it's a you know it's obviously not descendant but it you

122
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,560
it's obviously not descendant but it you know it's a grandparent basically 50

123
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,500
know it's a grandparent basically 50 okay it's an ancestor of lectures okay

124
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,800
okay it's an ancestor of lectures okay so in the reason I have to plug in this

125
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,690
so in the reason I have to plug in this time start is because these two

126
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,730
time start is because these two distributions together they give me the

127
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,670
distributions together they give me the probability of X 5 and X 6 condition X 2

128
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,430
probability of X 5 and X 6 condition X 2 X 3 and if I integrate X 5 altogether

129
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,700
X 3 and if I integrate X 5 altogether from Reliford 6 given X 2 X 3 and then

130
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,790
from Reliford 6 given X 2 X 3 and then this identity has been put okay

131
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,090
this identity has been put okay so this way when tisha here at work is a

132
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,169
so this way when tisha here at work is a lot of little things that are important

133
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:06,429
lot of little things that are important basically when you work with high

134
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:09,280
basically when you work with high dimensional distributions so obviously

135
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,929
dimensional distributions so obviously we use the factorization of this

136
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:17,229
we use the factorization of this distribution of the graph we managed to

137
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:19,059
distribution of the graph we managed to do some of the optimizations by

138
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:21,759
do some of the optimizations by appropriately removing the stations in

139
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,509
appropriately removing the stations in words okay starting basically from the

140
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:28,030
words okay starting basically from the Leafs base and then eventually going to

141
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,710
Leafs base and then eventually going to the to the root as needed and then we

142
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,710
the to the root as needed and then we use the independence relation here of

143
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,679
use the independence relation here of the parent overall being given the parts

144
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:42,119
the parent overall being given the parts being independent no descendants and

145
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:49,780
being independent no descendants and that's it okay so let me we discuss this

146
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,400
that's it okay so let me we discuss this example but I want to go back to it and

147
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,049
example but I want to go back to it and then we will do this with again with the

148
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:59,499
then we will do this with again with the distillation algorithm so we have a case

149
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:04,389
distillation algorithm so we have a case here over wet grass sprinkler being on

150
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:07,090
here over wet grass sprinkler being on or off rain overall so basically these

151
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,679
or off rain overall so basically these are binary variables okay and you can

152
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,309
are binary variables okay and you can see various problems one the goes from

153
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:18,699
see various problems one the goes from causes to effects such as cloudy this

154
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:22,059
causes to effects such as cloudy this will cause rain and this will cause to

155
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:25,389
will cause rain and this will cause to say the glass will be wet so far forward

156
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,669
say the glass will be wet so far forward inference problems in B is the glass

157
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:29,249
inference problems in B is the glass weren't given that's cloudy

158
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:32,350
weren't given that's cloudy right so information from a gates in the

159
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,660
right so information from a gates in the direction of the graph all right so this

160
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,449
direction of the graph all right so this is from positive x and that's the

161
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,309
is from positive x and that's the problem

162
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:45,850
all right so that's a very easy problem this is very similar sort of to what you

163
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,530
this is very similar sort of to what you do in Bayesian statistics will be likely

164
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,929
do in Bayesian statistics will be likely to write if you know the parameters what

165
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,350
to write if you know the parameters what is the output so here this causes the

166
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,140
is the output so here this causes the grass to be red so you're asking what is

167
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,269
grass to be red so you're asking what is will become equal 1 given to the sequel

168
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:02,140
will become equal 1 given to the sequel to the more important problem is the

169
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,940
to the more important problem is the English problem to go for the factory

170
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,490
English problem to go for the factory closes so if the grass is wet somebody

171
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,570
closes so if the grass is wet somebody can say is it raining in other words if

172
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,850
can say is it raining in other words if W is equal to R is R equal to R what's

173
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,680
W is equal to R is R equal to R what's the probability of L even more important

174
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,790
the probability of L even more important questions if the grass is wet is the

175
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,890
questions if the grass is wet is the probability that the drain higher than

176
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,470
probability that the drain higher than the probability that the sprinkler

177
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,990
the probability that the sprinkler result okay

178
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000


179
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,600
well actually that's a little bit different from from the one I have here

180
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,490
different from from the one I have here but basically seen in the same spirit

181
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,390
but basically seen in the same spirit and something that we will see in more

182
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:52,060
and something that we will see in more detail in the lecture today is this in a

183
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,060
detail in the lecture today is this in a pond so let's look at it again carefully

184
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,540
pond so let's look at it again carefully because we went through it but you know

185
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,130
because we went through it but you know what should you start getting this event

186
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,460
what should you start getting this event if you sleep ten times in the slide so I

187
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,620
if you sleep ten times in the slide so I have to condition probabilities both of

188
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,650
have to condition probabilities both of them stray or conditional on the grass

189
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,110
them stray or conditional on the grass being wet double equal to one and what I

190
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,750
being wet double equal to one and what I try to infer is if the sprinkler is on

191
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,420
try to infer is if the sprinkler is on or off and the argument here if this

192
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,910
or off and the argument here if this equation is correct I say given the

193
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,550
equation is correct I say given the damage equals one I say that if I also

194
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,130
damage equals one I say that if I also know that it's rain this probability is

195
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,150
know that it's rain this probability is less involved all right so I want you to

196
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,800
less involved all right so I want you to look at this equation carefully because

197
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,800
look at this equation carefully because what the sprinkler and the rain they

198
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,250
what the sprinkler and the rain they cause the glass to be wet so if somehow

199
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,970
cause the glass to be wet so if somehow so with this is an evidence if you have

200
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,140
so with this is an evidence if you have some information that they play this

201
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,610
some information that they play this immediately reduces the probabilities of

202
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,050
immediately reduces the probabilities of the sprinkler result because this

203
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,850
the sprinkler result because this evidence

204
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,810
evidence the grass is wet right so you have two

205
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,660
the grass is wet right so you have two possible causes here that the grass is

206
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,960
possible causes here that the grass is wet and if this was not there at all

207
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,509
wet and if this was not there at all right so we didn't have any the lower

208
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:09,480
right so we didn't have any the lower part of the graph is the probability of

209
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,940
part of the graph is the probability of the sprinkler is the sprinkler drain

210
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,630
the sprinkler is the sprinkler drain independent of each other

211
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,210
independent of each other if there is no no connection spacing you

212
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,920
if there is no no connection spacing you just have the sprinkler and Lorraine are

213
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,380
just have the sprinkler and Lorraine are they independent

214
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,000
they independent all right if they're independent now

215
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,579
all right if they're independent now once you observe the gas all right

216
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:33,060
once you observe the gas all right that's on vacation they are not

217
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,569
that's on vacation they are not independent right because knowing that

218
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:39,060
independent right because knowing that something about if it rained or not

219
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,370
something about if it rained or not immediately tells you something about it

220
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,639
immediately tells you something about it the sprinkler is all about so this is a

221
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,340
the sprinkler is all about so this is a weird event that it only appears in

222
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,610
weird event that it only appears in directional graphs and it is going to

223
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,430
directional graphs and it is going to vary many names explaining away is the

224
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,090
vary many names explaining away is the most common sense name right so

225
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,949
most common sense name right so observing one of the causes that the

226
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:01,680
observing one of the causes that the grass is wet it explains the way in the

227
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,569
grass is wet it explains the way in the fact that the sprinkler result okay sort

228
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,880
fact that the sprinkler result okay sort of a concept that doesn't come in other

229
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,120
of a concept that doesn't come in other sorts of graphs like under X undirected

230
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,620
sorts of graphs like under X undirected jobs

231
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:16,630


232
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:25,490
okay I personally have some additional questions you can work them out okay and

233
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,020
questions you can work them out okay and the same way is the first example that I

234
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,200
the same way is the first example that I showed you today so using which

235
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,799
showed you today so using which marginalization and moving the

236
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,570
marginalization and moving the summations in words so I'm going to

237
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,460
summations in words so I'm going to repeat this example shortly the local

238
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,370
repeat this example shortly the local property micro property that we have

239
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,830
property micro property that we have used them and I will try to give you

240
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,930
used them and I will try to give you well shapes different resistance of this

241
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:59,940
well shapes different resistance of this is that given the parts of a node V xB

242
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,419
is that given the parts of a node V xB is independent of the non descendents of

243
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:06,570
is independent of the non descendents of the node V and I am generalizing here

244
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,990
the node V and I am generalizing here I'm not saying have to be of the parents

245
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,610
I'm not saying have to be of the parents of V I mean I'm not saying of the

246
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,500
of V I mean I'm not saying of the ancestors of the am saying the

247
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,720
ancestors of the am saying the non-descendants

248
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,820
non-descendants which that is bigger the unstressed

249
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:25,250
which that is bigger the unstressed orthogonal descendants

250
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:25,260


251
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:33,050
which type is bigger the ancestral stronger non-descendants the

252
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,060
stronger non-descendants the non-descendants is bigger right so I can

253
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,210
non-descendants is bigger right so I can write this also I can take a subset of

254
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,450
write this also I can take a subset of anyway which are the ancestors and text

255
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,580
anyway which are the ancestors and text me is independent of the ancestors given

256
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,150
me is independent of the ancestors given the part and I want you to think if you

257
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,160
the part and I want you to think if you have a topological ordering the

258
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,470
have a topological ordering the ancestors basically are the notes that

259
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,250
ancestors basically are the notes that are numbered before we in the authority

260
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,480
are numbered before we in the authority but the non-descendants they have

261
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,780
but the non-descendants they have numbers that they're higher than C all

262
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,920
numbers that they're higher than C all right it's important here the

263
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,210
right it's important here the non-descendants you have numbers that

264
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,890
non-descendants you have numbers that have higher than this okay

265
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:12,759
have higher than this okay [Applause]

266
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:12,769


267
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:18,249
it's obviously in this case the for mr. Chappel good let's say this contest for

268
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:19,930
Chappel good let's say this contest for the student that gets different grades

269
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,440
the student that gets different grades and some is also from via safekeeping so

270
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,999
and some is also from via safekeeping so the let's accept this graph like that so

271
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:29,109
the let's accept this graph like that so we don't have to discuss all the details

272
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:32,489
we don't have to discuss all the details but basically the parents of this are

273
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:35,499
but basically the parents of this are there's no difficulty in intelligence

274
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:38,049
there's no difficulty in intelligence but you know the socialist idea is a non

275
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:45,580
but you know the socialist idea is a non descender right so wouldn't be ni this

276
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,389
descender right so wouldn't be ni this no this is the friend of SAT okay the

277
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,580
no this is the friend of SAT okay the note is something that I am discussing

278
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,239
note is something that I am discussing on the bottle but if you look at the

279
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:58,629
on the bottle but if you look at the great differently in terms of difficulty

280
00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:02,200
great differently in terms of difficulty alright it's not independent of the

281
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:09,310
alright it's not independent of the letter right because this is this is not

282
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:13,409
letter right because this is this is not in the list of the non-descendants okay

283
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:17,259
in the list of the non-descendants okay so G is not independent well given a and

284
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:22,330
so G is not independent well given a and B

285
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:22,340


286
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,950
a little bit about inference and again we discuss it very fast them and we were

287
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:30,489
we discuss it very fast them and we were spent at least two lectures to discuss

288
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:32,259
spent at least two lectures to discuss inference later also right now

289
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:35,320
inference later also right now accept this as an introduction to the

290
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:42,519
accept this as an introduction to the topic not that we cover anything so for

291
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:44,830
topic not that we cover anything so for those who know about hidden Markov

292
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,989
those who know about hidden Markov models and I think we saw in lecture 1

293
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:49,720
models and I think we saw in lecture 1 we have a hidden state and we have some

294
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,310
we have a hidden state and we have some noisy let's say observations maybe the

295
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,560
noisy let's say observations maybe the problem is to estimate the state given

296
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,009
problem is to estimate the state given the information because you know when we

297
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:04,690
the information because you know when we say inference not only you try to say

298
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,609
say inference not only you try to say something about known observe variables

299
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:08,259
something about known observe variables but maybe there are lots of parameters

300
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:10,960
but maybe there are lots of parameters started parameters in the module for

301
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,989
started parameters in the module for example we would say you know you

302
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:15,609
example we would say you know you decompose the joint probability

303
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,310
decompose the joint probability distribution in conditionals

304
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,109
distribution in conditionals did you notice conditional we know the

305
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:22,629
did you notice conditional we know the probability of x2 given x1 maybe have

306
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,399
probability of x2 given x1 maybe have some parametric definition right you say

307
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:26,590
some parametric definition right you say this is defined by this table everything

308
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,230
this is defined by this table everything is alone and everything is unknown means

309
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,730
is alone and everything is unknown means the toast probabilities in this table

310
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,529
the toast probabilities in this table are those parameters theta all right so

311
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:38,109
are those parameters theta all right so there is how are you there are two

312
00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:40,480
there is how are you there are two things right one is to estimate the

313
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,659
things right one is to estimate the scottie parameters theta and those

314
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:47,529
scottie parameters theta and those priorities theta don't increase as your

315
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:50,019
priorities theta don't increase as your dataset increases so for example in the

316
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:51,700
dataset increases so for example in the hidden Markov model you can keep

317
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,249
hidden Markov model you can keep collecting data this theta will remain

318
00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:55,330
collecting data this theta will remain the same

319
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,470
the same ok and we will do those things later on

320
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,909
ok and we will do those things later on but the number of shaded variables

321
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:05,710
but the number of shaded variables increases the number of observation data

322
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,850
increases the number of observation data type increases okay so in some sense the

323
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,700
type increases okay so in some sense the hidden exists and treated differently

324
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,270
hidden exists and treated differently from computing

325
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:18,020
from computing I'm gonna sleep in the morning okay so I

326
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,330
I'm gonna sleep in the morning okay so I I don't know I think I'm gonna show you

327
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,700
I don't know I think I'm gonna show you a slide or two an archery I'm surprised

328
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,930
a slide or two an archery I'm surprised but this is okay I don't know why this

329
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,560
but this is okay I don't know why this thinking here all right it doesn't

330
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,000
thinking here all right it doesn't matter I think actually talks about

331
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,290
matter I think actually talks about evidence we're gonna go to this light

332
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:38,960
evidence we're gonna go to this light bit so this takes the parameters people

333
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,700
bit so this takes the parameters people so let's say you know the conditional

334
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,860
so let's say you know the conditional distributions change your graph so

335
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,750
distributions change your graph so that's why you stay conditioning or

336
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,810
that's why you stay conditioning or theta so we're not people in the oil

337
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,520
theta so we're not people in the oil problems you do not know what we face

338
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,200
problems you do not know what we face you have to complete but you know theta

339
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,960
you have to complete but you know theta and you want given some evidence so

340
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,960
and you want given some evidence so these are the visible notes the

341
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,670
these are the visible notes the invisible notes actually means like in

342
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,760
invisible notes actually means like in this graph the budget notes alright and

343
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,020
this graph the budget notes alright and then you want to say start thinking

344
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,490
then you want to say start thinking about the kids in the valleys to the

345
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,950
about the kids in the valleys to the hidden rocks so you want to compute the

346
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,210
hidden rocks so you want to compute the probability of XT given X 3 with fixed

347
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,520
probability of XT given X 3 with fixed parameters so effectively what you do is

348
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,980
parameters so effectively what you do is a simple calculation that we say this

349
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,580
a simple calculation that we say this the question there is a resonance a show

350
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,640
the question there is a resonance a show that you have to do the denominator all

351
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,010
that you have to do the denominator all right this is a very important quantity

352
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,940
right this is a very important quantity this is the evidence this is basically

353
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,610
this is the evidence this is basically tells you how probable are the data that

354
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,570
tells you how probable are the data that you have observed

355
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,480
you have observed okay so this is how you calculate the

356
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,960
okay so this is how you calculate the evidence and in the numerator you need

357
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,820
evidence and in the numerator you need the Joint Commission of the kid another

358
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,660
the Joint Commission of the kid another vehicle body but the way I can tell you

359
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,320
vehicle body but the way I can tell you and it may be on a coming slide that if

360
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,360
and it may be on a coming slide that if you want to post a step or a problem in

361
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,130
you want to post a step or a problem in this area how do we compute this

362
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,980
this area how do we compute this parameters theta effectively

363
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,040
parameters theta effectively you compute the parameters by maximizing

364
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,590
you compute the parameters by maximizing the evidence which is the denominator T

365
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:06,380
the evidence which is the denominator T of XT given theta all right so

366
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:06,390


367
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:12,090
okay we don't need this life we'll need some partial details so this

368
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,510
we'll need some partial details so this is actually I mentioned that see that

369
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,110
is actually I mentioned that see that you want to compute it you maximize the

370
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,840
you want to compute it you maximize the evidence don't pay attention to this one

371
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,870
evidence don't pay attention to this one here to the second what have I done here

372
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:28,080
here to the second what have I done here before I had the probability of X being

373
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,890
before I had the probability of X being given theta so here I wrote this this is

374
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,720
given theta so here I wrote this this is sort of my new evidence the

375
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,450
sort of my new evidence the log-likelihood data logical but I have

376
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,070
log-likelihood data logical but I have done something else the fact I wrote the

377
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,470
done something else the fact I wrote the destination over N so what is this

378
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:45,630
destination over N so what is this summation you think why is Tommy what is

379
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:56,140
summation you think why is Tommy what is N what's capital N

380
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,150


381
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:00,669
the hidden letters not see the Lakers here say there's only one who do

382
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:02,620
here say there's only one who do calculate the likelihood right you

383
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,169
calculate the likelihood right you maximize the life of the data what is

384
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:07,659
maximize the life of the data what is the assumption implicitly implied by

385
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:11,919
the assumption implicitly implied by writing like this that my data by ad

386
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,000
writing like this that my data by ad okay all right so so basically we're

387
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,460
okay all right so so basically we're trying to filter that much minus the log

388
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,980
trying to filter that much minus the log likelihood and also just analyze the

389
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,850
likelihood and also just analyze the problem which is the preeminent to

390
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,279
problem which is the preeminent to computing a map estimate I have added

391
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,450
computing a map estimate I have added here the love of the pile of theta right

392
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,899
here the love of the pile of theta right so this likely Qin times the prior they

393
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:37,539
so this likely Qin times the prior they give you the posterior of theta okay see

394
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,399
give you the posterior of theta okay see the values are not there can be anything

395
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:42,639
the values are not there can be anything any ground okay so much smizing this and

396
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:44,260
any ground okay so much smizing this and performing this problem you get you

397
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,419
performing this problem you get you point parameters and again we will see

398
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,149
point parameters and again we will see this problem in detail with a lot of

399
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:51,820
this problem in detail with a lot of numerical and analytical results later

400
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,260
numerical and analytical results later on in the course cause it's a good idea

401
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,130
on in the course cause it's a good idea to know what it means

402
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,000
to know what it means completing the hidden variables

403
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,210
completing the hidden variables parameters sleep

404
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:04,220


405
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:11,320
right and another problem that maybe we will discuss in April very close to the

406
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,899
will discuss in April very close to the end of the semester would be this

407
00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:18,310
end of the semester would be this problem it goes under the links not

408
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,980
problem it goes under the links not celerity so for example in our sprinkle

409
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:26,200
celerity so for example in our sprinkle with glass problem let's say got a

410
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,619
with glass problem let's say got a different day somebody does observations

411
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:31,389
different day somebody does observations when it's cloudy if the sprinkler is on

412
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,700
when it's cloudy if the sprinkler is on it drains with the grass is wet and you

413
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:39,279
it drains with the grass is wet and you collect amounts of data on I did data so

414
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,310
collect amounts of data on I did data so maybe somebody will ask if I have this

415
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,889
maybe somebody will ask if I have this observation can you figure it out for me

416
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:48,789
observation can you figure it out for me what is the graph that represents these

417
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:51,190
what is the graph that represents these observations the only ways you know can

418
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,320
observations the only ways you know can you tell me that particular differential

419
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,539
you tell me that particular differential being cloudy of not rain defense a lot

420
00:26:55,539 --> 00:27:00,389
being cloudy of not rain defense a lot with grass defense of sprinkler rain etc

421
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:00,399


422
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:06,490
this problem effectively is false as a structure learning problem and see this

423
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:13,149
structure learning problem and see this as follows G you can get the log

424
00:27:13,149 --> 00:27:16,330
as follows G you can get the log likelihood of the data all right so the

425
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,820
likelihood of the data all right so the problem here is find the graph G that

426
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,230
problem here is find the graph G that maximizes the log likelihood of the day

427
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,149
maximizes the log likelihood of the day all right so for each graph like this

428
00:27:25,149 --> 00:27:26,830
all right so for each graph like this graph for example you can go and

429
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,889
graph for example you can go and calculate this okay

430
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:32,649
calculate this okay and if you calculate then for many

431
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:34,149
and if you calculate then for many graphs you can say finding the graph

432
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:36,759
graphs you can say finding the graph that maximizes that and this is sort of

433
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:39,490
that maximizes that and this is sort of a penalty terms to be sure that you

434
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,289
a penalty terms to be sure that you don't have an overly complex graph we

435
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:46,480
don't have an overly complex graph we discussed a bit about these things in

436
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,650
discussed a bit about these things in the fall of the balance of

437
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,930
the fall of the balance of between keeping the data and complexity

438
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,530
between keeping the data and complexity right so you don't want to overdo it

439
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,690
right so you don't want to overdo it again we will come up to this problem in

440
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:04,700
again we will come up to this problem in sometimes we need a tree okay and I want

441
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,010
sometimes we need a tree okay and I want to introduce one more from the mental

442
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,710
to introduce one more from the mental concept that you may have traditional

443
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:12,200
concept that you may have traditional programming and hopefully Tuvok takes

444
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,990
programming and hopefully Tuvok takes notes on this that has to do with

445
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,750
notes on this that has to do with ancestral subject okay because this is

446
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:22,700
ancestral subject okay because this is sort of a very essential for you know

447
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,040
sort of a very essential for you know clever and distribution of it a graph

448
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,470
clever and distribution of it a graph and you want to take samples full of

449
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:31,370
and you want to take samples full of distribution there is a very efficient

450
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,590
distribution there is a very efficient way of doing this so remember in in in

451
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,150
way of doing this so remember in in in directed graphs right the distribution

452
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,390
directed graphs right the distribution was let's say we have a chain okay so

453
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,080
was let's say we have a chain okay so the probability of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 3 is

454
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,690
the probability of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 3 is the probability of X 1 times the

455
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,150
the probability of X 1 times the probability of x2 given X 2 and 5 the

456
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,700
probability of x2 given X 2 and 5 the probability of X 3 given X 2 or in

457
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,650
probability of X 3 given X 2 or in general we have a product of the

458
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,480
general we have a product of the probability effect and even the parents

459
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,750
probability effect and even the parents of all right so I'm just on something

460
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,300
of all right so I'm just on something the sample we take a sample of this bar

461
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,670
the sample we take a sample of this bar and with such 1/2 let's say X K or

462
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:12,980
and with such 1/2 let's say X K or extreme we do is you start talking

463
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,800
extreme we do is you start talking interest from the probability P x1 we

464
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,000
interest from the probability P x1 we start with the root note then the sample

465
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,460
start with the root note then the sample the problem there if you sample from the

466
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,990
the problem there if you sample from the conditional effect still given the

467
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,480
conditional effect still given the participant still and the part of it

468
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,790
participant still and the part of it still basically is x1 which already

469
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:32,030
still basically is x1 which already focused on hope right and then the

470
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,220
focused on hope right and then the probability of X 3 given the powers of X

471
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,270
probability of X 3 given the powers of X 3 which I will assume are x1 and x2

472
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,820
3 which I will assume are x1 and x2 right so you basically proceed from the

473
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,970
right so you basically proceed from the root to the left

474
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,380
root to the left countering first from this marginal and

475
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,960
countering first from this marginal and then from this conditional and this is

476
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,120
then from this conditional and this is called ancestral soundly

477
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,910
called ancestral soundly and there's many algorithm this thing in

478
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:55,220
and there's many algorithm this thing in Montecarlo reference that sort of take

479
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,490
Montecarlo reference that sort of take advantage of that so in other ways if

480
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,040
advantage of that so in other ways if the distribution is 50 dimensional near

481
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,170
the distribution is 50 dimensional near South Point between dimensions the

482
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,970
South Point between dimensions the sample from very low dimensional

483
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,960
sample from very low dimensional distributions by taking a particular in

484
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,900
distributions by taking a particular in effect they we realizations of the

485
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:17,330
effect they we realizations of the directions on the box makes a bit of

486
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:25,370
directions on the box makes a bit of sense okay so many things from election

487
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,520
sense okay so many things from election to with another little concept and those

488
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:40,490
to with another little concept and those within a Markov blanket okay blanket is

489
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,420
within a Markov blanket okay blanket is the set of nodes that render Sanofi

490
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,560
the set of nodes that render Sanofi conditionally independent of folder all

491
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,140
conditionally independent of folder all the nodes in the dock in other ways what

492
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,840
the nodes in the dock in other ways what is the minimal number of nodes which I

493
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,680
is the minimal number of nodes which I need to know so that no information from

494
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,390
need to know so that no information from any other nodes we make any difference

495
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:01,520
any other nodes we make any difference in my about saying something about the T

496
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,090
in my about saying something about the T no no T so it's the set of nodes but

497
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,710
no no T so it's the set of nodes but make the node conditional independence

498
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:12,110
make the node conditional independence all the other nodes in a graph okay

499
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:16,010
all the other nodes in a graph okay and so let me just tell you that what it

500
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,020
and so let me just tell you that what it consists of

501
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:23,720
it consists of the violence of the node the hindrance of the node and the

502
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,900
the hindrance of the node and the copilot of the node right because some

503
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,110
copilot of the node right because some node step too far and so the components

504
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,270
node step too far and so the components of the road so can you tell me what is

505
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,490
of the road so can you tell me what is the mark of blanket

506
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:42,039
the mark of blanket no talk huh I'm here 23 no there are 23

507
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:46,649
no talk huh I'm here 23 no there are 23 under father so you let me wander

508
00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:51,310
under father so you let me wander without the children five six and seven

509
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:55,690
without the children five six and seven and what are the components what are the

510
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:59,890
and what are the components what are the components of five you notice Frank is a

511
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,680
components of five you notice Frank is a a kid seven and if you can't another

512
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,520
a kid seven and if you can't another father or mother for of poor is a

513
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,110
father or mother for of poor is a co-parent of long time okay

514
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:14,360
co-parent of long time okay now you may ask me

515
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,100
now you may ask me you know is there any proof of this

516
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,170
you know is there any proof of this place is coming and I'm going to at

517
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,450
place is coming and I'm going to at least highlight its being in one slide

518
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:26,750
least highlight its being in one slide to see this but then the Marfa Blanca

519
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,790
to see this but then the Marfa Blanca the five of the forest two and three

520
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,640
the five of the forest two and three right the children six and seven and

521
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,590
right the children six and seven and then the cool parents in this case is

522
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:37,790
then the cool parents in this case is for so basically knowing two three four

523
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,120
for so basically knowing two three four six and seven

524
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:47,990
six and seven no fives in the friend of node 1 okay so

525
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,950
no fives in the friend of node 1 okay so in essence think with this notes isolate

526
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,690
in essence think with this notes isolate note 5 all right

527
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,600
note 5 all right the separation of five from the rest of

528
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,840
the separation of five from the rest of the launch integral ok and and actually

529
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,330
the launch integral ok and and actually this thing did what this graph shows

530
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:05,270
this thing did what this graph shows let's say this is this other parent

531
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,030
let's say this is this other parent all right these are the children which

532
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,680
all right these are the children which are the copilot from knowing all this

533
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,650
are the copilot from knowing all this information separate this is what's a

534
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:16,520
information separate this is what's a blanket which sort of to isolate X from

535
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,490
blanket which sort of to isolate X from the rest of the graph an extremely sort

536
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:23,330
the rest of the graph an extremely sort of important idea here all right the

537
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,740
of important idea here all right the drawing parents and again everybody

538
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,020
drawing parents and again everybody forgets not the components come in the

539
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,030
forgets not the components come in the picture okay like you know the fourth

540
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:36,500
picture okay like you know the fourth year list extremely important so we do

541
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,280
year list extremely important so we do this example

542
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,470
this example so any highlight the point okay it's you

543
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,450
so any highlight the point okay it's you know a lot of these things terms of

544
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:49,510
know a lot of these things terms of their authors but I want you to sort of

545
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,650
their authors but I want you to sort of realize that they don't come from north

546
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,640
realize that they don't come from north where there is some common sense

547
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,540
where there is some common sense derivation there so let's say

548
00:33:59,540 --> 00:33:59,550


549
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:06,440
we know the probability we won't me all the relevant notes but no die what's the

550
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,740
the relevant notes but no die what's the problem being to fix all right remember

551
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,710
problem being to fix all right remember we said the market market is the

552
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,090
we said the market market is the strength of the notes the thighs the

553
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,070
strength of the notes the thighs the lays know the eye from the rest of the

554
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:20,180
lays know the eye from the rest of the notes so you need to know from what is

555
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,000
notes so you need to know from what is this perform infinity depends on carry

556
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,310
this perform infinity depends on carry put it basically excited given all the

557
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,280
put it basically excited given all the other notes and what I'm asking is do I

558
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,350
other notes and what I'm asking is do I really need all the other notes or some

559
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,240
really need all the other notes or some of us you know it's basically we come to

560
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,280
of us you know it's basically we come to they are important so when I could not

561
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,550
they are important so when I could not is I wrote this as the joint probability

562
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,990
is I wrote this as the joint probability of for the notes in the mouth in the

563
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:43,730
of for the notes in the mouth in the track event and here he kept - I have

564
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,220
track event and here he kept - I have the probability of list of quarter notes

565
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:50,050
the probability of list of quarter notes Mathari so I have to materialize my out

566
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:53,240
Mathari so I have to materialize my out so I use the factorization on the top is

567
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,820
so I use the factorization on the top is an authorization on the bottom okay

568
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,210
an authorization on the bottom okay and now though I don't want you to need

569
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,920
and now though I don't want you to need anything here right so don't get

570
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:08,440
anything here right so don't get polluted by reading look this ratio and

571
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,040
polluted by reading look this ratio and figure out what terms you know sometimes

572
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,599
figure out what terms you know sometimes are going to cancel from the numerator

573
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:17,090
are going to cancel from the numerator and denominator what is going to be left

574
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:20,480
and denominator what is going to be left there so here I have the whole

575
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,300
there so here I have the whole distribution and they're like have X

576
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,910
distribution and they're like have X trying to graveyard so what is left what

577
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,530
trying to graveyard so what is left what is what are the common terms doesn't

578
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,920
is what are the common terms doesn't disappear so that this X I who made a

579
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,240
disappear so that this X I who made a time dependent

580
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,109
time dependent given this Markov Blanca dimension so

581
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:38,180
given this Markov Blanca dimension so what you know term some disappearing

582
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:43,020
what you know term some disappearing from this ratio

583
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,030


584
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,670
look for you know even better what notes are they going to stay in that

585
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:55,440
are they going to stay in that calculation

586
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:55,450


587
00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:03,599
with my mind that's not very good

588
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:03,609


589
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:12,839
okay so there is an integration care of its high right so let's see in in this

590
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,989
its high right so let's see in in this product there is a distribution of X my

591
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:21,449
product there is a distribution of X my given the parent right ladies

592
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:23,910
given the parent right ladies distributions that involves the children

593
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:27,539
distributions that involves the children given the politics i right

594
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:31,259
given the politics i right and those distributions involve also the

595
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:39,120
and those distributions involve also the copilot you see that I mean somehow here

596
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,519
copilot you see that I mean somehow here because an integrative annex I write in

597
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:44,729
because an integrative annex I write in the denominator anything that relates

598
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:46,620
the denominator anything that relates book starring of the top has to stay

599
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,969
book starring of the top has to stay there and what this relations contain at

600
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:53,849
there and what this relations contain at tie is the distribution of X i given its

601
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:55,499
tie is the distribution of X i given its parents right

602
00:36:55,499 --> 00:36:58,499
parents right nice ghostie nodes and then the

603
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:01,859
nice ghostie nodes and then the distribution of the children of X I in

604
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:03,989
distribution of the children of X I in that differential from the co-pilot

605
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:05,789
that differential from the co-pilot so this children depends on the trolley

606
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:08,519
so this children depends on the trolley and the copilot you see those are the

607
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:14,430
and the copilot you see those are the only distributions of any display yep so

608
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,140
only distributions of any display yep so basically this type of nodes that you

609
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:24,010
basically this type of nodes that you see there are the mark of Naga

610
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:24,020


611
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:32,079
now the so the market wanted basically gives a very efficient way for computing

612
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,599
gives a very efficient way for computing the probability of a now given all the

613
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,570
the probability of a now given all the other nodes all right because we said

614
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,640
other nodes all right because we said this probably the only depends on the

615
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,609
this probably the only depends on the parents for parents and children okay

616
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:45,339
parents for parents and children okay and I did it here one example of the

617
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:48,900
and I did it here one example of the probability of X 5 given all the other

618
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,120
probability of X 5 given all the other I'm sorry given all the nodes with type

619
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:58,540
I'm sorry given all the nodes with type right you can write this reverse the

620
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,630
right you can write this reverse the factorization of the Joint Distribution

621
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:04,300
factorization of the Joint Distribution the only terms of pay is expired given

622
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,060
the only terms of pay is expired given experience three right five depends on

623
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,480
experience three right five depends on the parents children depending on five

624
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,900
the parents children depending on five and three right and then notice what

625
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,070
and three right and then notice what else we never have several depending on

626
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:20,470
else we never have several depending on five and six the parlance and the

627
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:24,010
five and six the parlance and the copilot for a case why I indicated here

628
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,240
copilot for a case why I indicated here for five states in this calculation can

629
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,770
for five states in this calculation can here well it's written here again those

630
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:36,220
here well it's written here again those who have taken courses for should the

631
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,579
who have taken courses for should the computational statistics course in which

632
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:43,390
computational statistics course in which means in the fall we recognize basically

633
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,839
means in the fall we recognize basically business the distribution we need to do

634
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:49,990
business the distribution we need to do get something right so this is the

635
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,700
get something right so this is the cognition we need to give to give

636
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,630
cognition we need to give to give something and you see a nice

637
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:59,530
something and you see a nice fertilization to keep in mind the sort

638
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,020
fertilization to keep in mind the sort of idea so far instead of something and

639
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,810
of idea so far instead of something and the concept of Markov blanket welcome to

640
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,079
the concept of Markov blanket welcome to camp with a very nice implementation of

641
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,539
camp with a very nice implementation of get started

642
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:12,849
get started so we will assure give you homework from

643
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:19,960
so we will assure give you homework from this soon okay

644
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,470
this soon okay so let me summarize and then we're done

645
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:27,599
so let me summarize and then we're done with lecture to every know given the you

646
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,420
with lecture to every know given the you know descendants okay now try moving the

647
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:36,370
know descendants okay now try moving the parent is independent of the

648
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,220
parent is independent of the non-disabled and I assume for the

649
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,789
non-disabled and I assume for the parents and the predecessors are a

650
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:45,670
parents and the predecessors are a subset of the you know descendants so T

651
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:48,609
subset of the you know descendants so T is independent of the three defendants

652
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:53,410
is independent of the three defendants given the powers and so this is called

653
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,519
given the powers and so this is called the directive local Markov property this

654
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:59,319
the directive local Markov property this is called the order Markov property we

655
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:01,000
is called the order Markov property we can appreciate why it's for London

656
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,200
can appreciate why it's for London because in essence this knowledge of

657
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:13,319
because in essence this knowledge of numbering that is before the number of T

658
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:13,329


659
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:21,190
so this local property L immediately gives to you the order Markov property

660
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,960
gives to you the order Markov property because this is a subset of the known

661
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,319
because this is a subset of the known dependents what is interesting is if

662
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,930
dependents what is interesting is if this property is true then also the

663
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:32,440
this property is true then also the other properties to all right and that

664
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,450
other properties to all right and that makes a bit of calculation if you are

665
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:38,650
makes a bit of calculation if you are interested you can read this move for

666
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,849
interested you can read this move for the derivation so effectively this still

667
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:44,279
the derivation so effectively this still Markov properties are equivalent and

668
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:46,960
Markov properties are equivalent and both of them can be shown that they are

669
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,720
both of them can be shown that they are equivalent with a polarization that we

670
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,319
equivalent with a polarization that we have seen you know talking in lecture

671
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:54,400
have seen you know talking in lecture one

672
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,309
one electric drums so again a local property

673
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:02,680
electric drums so again a local property an order Markov property and this

674
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,740
an order Markov property and this factorization you can feel from one of

675
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,210
factorization you can feel from one of them you can prove what the other ones

676
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,240
them you can prove what the other ones and the other way around

677
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,819
and the other way around remember in some of the little examples

678
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:14,470
remember in some of the little examples we did without the information we were

679
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,559
we did without the information we were proving you know sort of identities but

680
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,210
proving you know sort of identities but also you can prove that starting with

681
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,760
also you can prove that starting with any of this you can solve a district

682
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:33,850
any of this you can solve a district relationship one can

683
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:33,860


684
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,170
I have to drink some coffee at lunchtime because from my system it's gotten at

685
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:42,160
because from my system it's gotten at this time and without it we may still

686
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,090
this time and without it we may still equally in this little here okay but one

687
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:47,890
equally in this little here okay but one day I'm sure that you see all the coffee

688
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:50,890
day I'm sure that you see all the coffee coming on the top of me not paying

689
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:53,800
coming on the top of me not paying attention because talking and drinking

690
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,010
attention because talking and drinking coffees not the jungle can be continued

691
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:00,000
coffees not the jungle can be continued so drinking wine isn't talking

692
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,970
so drinking wine isn't talking alright and this is going to be a little

693
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:09,550
alright and this is going to be a little bit weird it's not very public is

694
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:14,050
bit weird it's not very public is basically the graphical way to figure

695
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:16,180
basically the graphical way to figure out what independence relations you have

696
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:20,080
out what independence relations you have in a graph okay so we want to dis have a

697
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,370
in a graph okay so we want to dis have a calculation so I'll go under the name

698
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:27,070
calculation so I'll go under the name this separation is what is going to

699
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,560
this separation is what is going to allow us to figure out independence in

700
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,850
allow us to figure out independence in the graph so I have to admit when you

701
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,740
the graph so I have to admit when you first see them this may sound a little

702
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,590
first see them this may sound a little bit weird the only thing I'm going to

703
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:42,250
bit weird the only thing I'm going to say just our homes because Rose has to

704
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45,670
say just our homes because Rose has to decide and you can secular satisfied

705
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,920
decide and you can secular satisfied then you can test independence

706
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,880
then you can test independence relationships

707
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,220
relationships so this'll look like something will

708
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:54,010
so this'll look like something will drive we cannot for this reason you can

709
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:56,400
drive we cannot for this reason you can solve that they're equivalent to this

710
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,600
solve that they're equivalent to this local mark of properties that we

711
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,330
local mark of properties that we discussed before and this will go on the

712
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:05,590
discussed before and this will go on the name the separation so definitions there

713
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:07,210
name the separation so definitions there is way too much information that's right

714
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,750
is way too much information that's right so let's go line by line and undirected

715
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,240
so let's go line by line and undirected path is this separated by a set of nodes

716
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,390
path is this separated by a set of nodes II so he clearly implies the notes that

717
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,450
II so he clearly implies the notes that I know about the evidence so an

718
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,760
I know about the evidence so an undirected graph is the separated if at

719
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,030
undirected graph is the separated if at least one of the Tony Hawk so in the

720
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,310
least one of the Tony Hawk so in the various graphs that you see this is my

721
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:31,090
various graphs that you see this is my evidence right this is my evidence

722
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:37,900
evidence right this is my evidence so here the path from X to Z right the

723
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,970
so here the path from X to Z right the arrows point in this way but

724
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:42,670
arrows point in this way but can also find the opposite way so it can

725
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:46,240
can also find the opposite way so it can be this or that so in this case we say

726
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,460
be this or that so in this case we say that x and z are be separated from Y if

727
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:57,570
that x and z are be separated from Y if Y is observed okay so a lot of times

728
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:01,210
Y is observed okay so a lot of times what you say basically is whenever this

729
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:04,090
what you say basically is whenever this node and you see the arrow converging

730
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,640
node and you see the arrow converging this chance and tail so if you have

731
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,980
this chance and tail so if you have heads entailed already obtained and

732
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,740
heads entailed already obtained and shares the other way around and this is

733
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,500
shares the other way around and this is an observed node the next year this

734
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,880
an observed node the next year this operator is given Y okay mr. Paretti so

735
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,380
operator is given Y okay mr. Paretti so you can you can start getting the

736
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:23,050
you can you can start getting the concept right means the Texans they're

737
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:25,750
concept right means the Texans they're independent really given Y reinstitute

738
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:29,140
independent really given Y reinstitute not really rich Z from X by going

739
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,990
not really rich Z from X by going through the evidence known why okay and

740
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:37,630
through the evidence known why okay and this sort of little blocks that you see

741
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,950
this sort of little blocks that you see on the bottom that's what they indicate

742
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:42,280
on the bottom that's what they indicate but somehow the path from X to Z is

743
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,600
but somehow the path from X to Z is broke if you observe why okay I'm

744
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,130
broke if you observe why okay I'm throwing a lots of terminology there but

745
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,020
throwing a lots of terminology there but so this is one part of the definition if

746
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,910
so this is one part of the definition if you have this situation and wise observe

747
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:59,250
you have this situation and wise observe okay excellent zero disparate from Y

748
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:04,390
okay excellent zero disparate from Y another case is when if you have a stock

749
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:07,270
another case is when if you have a stock situation right so this is the parent

750
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:11,620
situation right so this is the parent pointing into two children so again we

751
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,640
pointing into two children so again we contain support and wise and evidence

752
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,190
contain support and wise and evidence excellency then and be separated by Y so

753
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:21,040
excellency then and be separated by Y so again you notice the path is indicated

754
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,940
again you notice the path is indicated here products the Z is blocked because Y

755
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:27,160
here products the Z is blocked because Y doesn't allow this to go through

756
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,589
doesn't allow this to go through and try to go from X to Z or from seed

757
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:35,260
and try to go from X to Z or from seed to X the pocketbook have instead what's

758
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,789
to X the pocketbook have instead what's the relation with independence for

759
00:45:36,789 --> 00:45:38,799
the relation with independence for anything I'm defining I'm just giving

760
00:45:38,799 --> 00:45:42,039
anything I'm defining I'm just giving some definitions right but we can

761
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,870
some definitions right but we can motivate what these definitions are

762
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:46,990
motivate what these definitions are going to be about okay so again we will

763
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,839
going to be about okay so again we will show that in this case given Y and

764
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,059
show that in this case given Y and sharing this fork structure with Y given

765
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:54,130
sharing this fork structure with Y given being in the evidence actions here

766
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,390
being in the evidence actions here conditionally independent given Y and

767
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:02,319
conditionally independent given Y and then of course we have this explaining

768
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:08,680
then of course we have this explaining away situation where we have X and G be

769
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:13,750
away situation where we have X and G be the causes of the same Y right so the

770
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,960
the causes of the same Y right so the arrows bullet at this is a restructure

771
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,839
arrows bullet at this is a restructure and notice that the patient suddenly

772
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:20,890
and notice that the patient suddenly changed

773
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:23,890
changed it says they contain service trucks like

774
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,720
it says they contain service trucks like that and we say the text in Z are

775
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,240
that and we say the text in Z are dissipated if the destruction like math

776
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,990
dissipated if the destruction like math and y is not in the evidence why is not

777
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:38,920
and y is not in the evidence why is not observed so in other ways the path from

778
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:45,890
observed so in other ways the path from X to Z is block if y is not a safe

779
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:45,900


780
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:54,240
perfect why is nothing set okay

781
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:54,250


782
00:46:54,250 --> 00:47:00,990
so basically if wise not observed we will see in the comics life that

783
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:06,720
will see in the comics life that excellency you know are they will give

784
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,910
excellency you know are they will give this example what did we say for X and Z

785
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:17,130
this example what did we say for X and Z alone what did we say there were

786
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:19,440
alone what did we say there were handsome undefended all right so

787
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,570
handsome undefended all right so obviously this wise and himself I know

788
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:22,920
obviously this wise and himself I know not the excellency of artillery

789
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,680
not the excellency of artillery independent once I observed why they

790
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:33,700
independent once I observed why they become dependent okay

791
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:33,710


792
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:39,309
so before we had done you you know XY &amp; z notes but you can tell relies this to

793
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:41,289
z notes but you can tell relies this to a set of notes or fear percentage we

794
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:44,920
a set of notes or fear percentage we don't say we say that in a given graph

795
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,049
don't say we say that in a given graph is dissipated from a set of notes be

796
00:47:47,049 --> 00:47:49,809
is dissipated from a set of notes be given some evidence on the step of no 60

797
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:57,910
given some evidence on the step of no 60 if basically this is be separated from

798
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:00,400
if basically this is be separated from the given e so to try to mystical for

799
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,099
the given e so to try to mystical for any note way to an old in me to be

800
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:09,160
any note way to an old in me to be evidence knows that part is block okay

801
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:17,859
evidence knows that part is block okay using the rules that we have seen so so

802
00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:21,670
using the rules that we have seen so so this may involve a small angle it right

803
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:25,240
this may involve a small angle it right I mean the thing is you know when you

804
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:30,210
I mean the thing is you know when you start putting this topics in place right

805
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:34,240
start putting this topics in place right 350 years ago when people doing that you

806
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,789
350 years ago when people doing that you can call anything anything you know so

807
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:40,029
can call anything anything you know so the idea is I don't know the history I

808
00:48:40,029 --> 00:48:41,980
the idea is I don't know the history I think is very possible mr. Vaile

809
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,370
think is very possible mr. Vaile reference 98 introduced responsible very

810
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:50,620
reference 98 introduced responsible very small so the idea is to to graphically

811
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:55,569
small so the idea is to to graphically business operation the probable and you

812
00:48:55,569 --> 00:48:57,579
business operation the probable and you try to shape a ball that you throw text

813
00:48:57,579 --> 00:49:02,500
try to shape a ball that you throw text can reach Z all right and you have some

814
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,510
can reach Z all right and you have some rules the best date tells you when the

815
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,490
rules the best date tells you when the ball can pass through and evidence we

816
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:07,390
ball can pass through and evidence we all don't know

817
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:13,390
all don't know okay and so if you can read Z then

818
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:16,000
okay and so if you can read Z then basically the path is not block if you

819
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,220
basically the path is not block if you cannot reach the path is blocked and the

820
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,779
cannot reach the path is blocked and the notes are independent given the evidence

821
00:49:19,779 --> 00:49:22,029
notes are independent given the evidence so basically this is the same picture

822
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:24,579
so basically this is the same picture that we had before but again think

823
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:27,519
that we had before but again think you're throwing it home and it's

824
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:29,500
you're throwing it home and it's important on the northeast a song called

825
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,839
important on the northeast a song called the most in travel offers it to be as

826
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,849
the most in travel offers it to be as directions right

827
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:36,219
directions right and this has to do with the fact that

828
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:39,199
and this has to do with the fact that you know like in this case the arrows

829
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:41,269
you know like in this case the arrows can look the other direction as well you

830
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,939
can look the other direction as well you get the same result so the most can have

831
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,849
get the same result so the most can have an opposite to the s directions so

832
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:50,929
an opposite to the s directions so here's the case given why if you throw a

833
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:54,890
here's the case given why if you throw a ball is blocked here so actions here be

834
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:55,759
ball is blocked here so actions here be separated

835
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:58,160
separated if Y is not given the ball can go

836
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,249
if Y is not given the ball can go through you can go from X to Z here if Y

837
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:04,370
through you can go from X to Z here if Y is given to the spot from X Y Z is

838
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,859
is given to the spot from X Y Z is blocked so if you you know the monster

839
00:50:06,859 --> 00:50:10,699
blocked so if you you know the monster me back so actions here independent

840
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:12,679
me back so actions here independent basically given Y I'm just giving you

841
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:14,989
basically given Y I'm just giving you this you know because this is what we're

842
00:50:14,989 --> 00:50:18,859
this you know because this is what we're gonna use again if Y is not given then

843
00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:22,880
gonna use again if Y is not given then the ball can go from X to Z no problem

844
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,729
the ball can go from X to Z no problem and then this is the is explaining a way

845
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:32,419
and then this is the is explaining a way situation excellency the path is blocked

846
00:50:32,419 --> 00:50:36,019
situation excellency the path is blocked to Y if Y is not observed was very

847
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:38,239
to Y if Y is not observed was very important it's observe then you can go

848
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:40,640
important it's observe then you can go from X to Z so if you remember those

849
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,549
from X to Z so if you remember those rules basically you can test

850
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:45,169
rules basically you can test independence in any directed drop

851
00:50:45,169 --> 00:50:49,429
independence in any directed drop without doing any calculations budget

852
00:50:49,429 --> 00:50:54,319
without doing any calculations budget okay now when I say you can do any

853
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,719
okay now when I say you can do any calculations obviously books given with

854
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:58,969
calculations obviously books given with 135 but actually they give you the right

855
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:02,599
135 but actually they give you the right answers right so maybe I will do a

856
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:04,219
answers right so maybe I will do a trivial example you guys can do a more

857
00:51:04,219 --> 00:51:07,009
trivial example you guys can do a more complicated example but before you do an

858
00:51:07,009 --> 00:51:10,400
complicated example but before you do an example I also need to tell you oh this

859
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,380
example I also need to tell you oh this is the same slide but you have to

860
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:15,410
is the same slide but you have to confirm under conditions so what happens

861
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:17,089
confirm under conditions so what happens is the bone which is the root node of

862
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:20,089
is the bone which is the root node of the list and so there are pusher to

863
00:51:20,089 --> 00:51:26,660
the list and so there are pusher to boundary conditions if you reach

864
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,539
boundary conditions if you reach Nick node and the myth note is observed

865
00:51:29,539 --> 00:51:36,799
Nick node and the myth note is observed the note comes back all right if this is

866
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:39,529
the note comes back all right if this is observed basically the more the us the

867
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:45,470
observed basically the more the us the ball okay now if the error goes in the

868
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:51,289
ball okay now if the error goes in the other direction okay so in this case if

869
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:54,799
other direction okay so in this case if Y is different the path is blocked all

870
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:56,900
Y is different the path is blocked all right so the ball doesn't return back

871
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,970
right so the ball doesn't return back the opposite would interfere

872
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:02,089
the opposite would interfere and if Y's are observed the mall

873
00:52:02,089 --> 00:52:05,839
and if Y's are observed the mall compartment this way we need something

874
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,789
compartment this way we need something to have to stop the algorithm dot

875
00:52:07,789 --> 00:52:10,579
to have to stop the algorithm dot something it is listed among the

876
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:12,529
something it is listed among the relationship when we do some examples

877
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,690
relationship when we do some examples remind me to come back on the slide 29

878
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,729
remind me to come back on the slide 29 so you can see that through these

879
00:52:16,729 --> 00:52:19,009
so you can see that through these boundary conditions actually do make

880
00:52:19,009 --> 00:52:30,109
boundary conditions actually do make Church okay so this is what we were

881
00:52:30,109 --> 00:52:35,029
Church okay so this is what we were talking on the previous slide right this

882
00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:39,140
talking on the previous slide right this is exactly this situation here so if Y

883
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,660
is exactly this situation here so if Y is observable x mark if Y will observe

884
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,450
is observable x mark if Y will observe the model block so let's consider the

885
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:48,079
the model block so let's consider the following situation we have this V

886
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,839
following situation we have this V structure-wise are observed all right

887
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:54,979
structure-wise are observed all right don't pay attention to this

888
00:52:54,979 --> 00:52:56,900
don't pay attention to this the walls are observed so if I found

889
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:03,210
the walls are observed so if I found from it what is going to happen here

890
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:03,220


891
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:17,420
you can tell em f of X in this case we're more definitely the answer is no

892
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:23,280
we're more definitely the answer is no all right this is what okay so the

893
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,890
all right this is what okay so the poppies blow however let's consider how

894
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:31,069
poppies blow however let's consider how many K Y is not observed but let's say

895
00:53:31,069 --> 00:53:35,130
many K Y is not observed but let's say it's children of Y or some noise in the

896
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:38,190
it's children of Y or some noise in the presentation of eyes observe then with

897
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:43,670
presentation of eyes observe then with if accomplice so religion is why the

898
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,170
if accomplice so religion is why the Magnaflow but now what you seen desired

899
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:51,450
Magnaflow but now what you seen desired then what happens in an in a and a heavy

900
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:53,640
then what happens in an in a and a heavy disclosed sentiment analysis for y prime

901
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,550
disclosed sentiment analysis for y prime is a noisy version of Y effectively y

902
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:59,130
is a noisy version of Y effectively y prime is a noisy version of Y observing

903
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:01,710
prime is a noisy version of Y observing y Prime's the stainless observing Y and

904
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,390
y Prime's the stainless observing Y and when you observed Y what confidence to

905
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:10,840
when you observed Y what confidence to remote

906
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:10,850


907
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:15,520
you remember

908
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:15,530


909
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:20,920
so when you observe live right if it's not vote for X you can reach you can

910
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:27,880
not vote for X you can reach you can reach Z okay so this is a tricky

911
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:28,810
reach Z okay so this is a tricky situation

912
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,000
situation all right to you when you have this

913
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,670
all right to you when you have this restructure this explaining away and you

914
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:37,240
restructure this explaining away and you have something here an observation we

915
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,350
have something here an observation we have evidence from the children of Y

916
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:43,660
have evidence from the children of Y pretty effectively the same as having

917
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:47,230
pretty effectively the same as having observations on Y itself because

918
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:49,720
observations on Y itself because basically this unlocks the path from X

919
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,340
basically this unlocks the path from X to Z all right so let's write this and

920
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:58,150
to Z all right so let's write this and see that this is not just released but

921
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:00,340
see that this is not just released but somehow they do make sense so let's

922
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,520
somehow they do make sense so let's start with the most trivial case so

923
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,490
start with the most trivial case so we're going to take this alright song

924
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:09,280
we're going to take this alright song writing my dissolution Direction Y and

925
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,670
writing my dissolution Direction Y and VST effects py given X P of Z given Y

926
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:19,150
VST effects py given X P of Z given Y all right so all right so we condition

927
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:24,640
all right so all right so we condition on Y so next if I am evidence of Y what

928
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,120
on Y so next if I am evidence of Y what happens between X and Z and I'm just

929
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,120
happens between X and Z and I'm just using you know from the numerator little

930
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,950
using you know from the numerator little bit of XY and Z and denominator

931
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:36,250
bit of XY and Z and denominator convinced of Y this is P of x and y so

932
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,910
convinced of Y this is P of x and y so this is no P of x given Y so you notice

933
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,560
this is no P of x given Y so you notice that excellency become independent of

934
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:47,830
that excellency become independent of given Y right okay so when we have this

935
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:51,640
given Y right okay so when we have this you know observed and it can contain

936
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,180
you know observed and it can contain here had some pain and observe then the

937
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:59,770
here had some pain and observe then the path is blocked and that's we you know

938
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:02,650
path is blocked and that's we you know we call this graph separation right and

939
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,950
we call this graph separation right and it's equivalent to

940
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:07,079
it's equivalent to this independent simulation would be

941
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:10,440
this independent simulation would be seamless a question so the idea here is

942
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,690
seamless a question so the idea here is rather than having to prove an equation

943
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:16,470
rather than having to prove an equation like that if you can prove that the note

944
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:19,470
like that if you can prove that the note section Z are not separated all right

945
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:21,570
section Z are not separated all right and the rien tation of the arrow scale

946
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:24,349
and the rien tation of the arrow scale don't even make a big difference okay

947
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:26,550
don't even make a big difference okay stretch he'll use the biggest mole

948
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,079
stretch he'll use the biggest mole algorithm for something from extra

949
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,730
algorithm for something from extra between zero and that part is blocked

950
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:33,450
between zero and that part is blocked then excellency are independent even why

951
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:36,750
then excellency are independent even why okay Felicia Rizal would it improve to

952
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:43,710
okay Felicia Rizal would it improve to check this permission independent spirit

953
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:43,720


954
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:51,720
okay you know this is the Michael che all right first folder and it says given

955
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:55,200
all right first folder and it says given X I X I plus 1 is independent of for the

956
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,930
X I X I plus 1 is independent of for the previous exercise right this the

957
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:01,349
previous exercise right this the first-order Markov chain can give me an

958
00:57:01,349 --> 00:57:04,170
first-order Markov chain can give me an argument of this being through using the

959
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,680
argument of this being through using the separation however going to stop this

960
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:16,290
separation however going to stop this that this is you know so let's say in

961
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:20,250
that this is you know so let's say in this case x-rays the evidence for my

962
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:23,609
this case x-rays the evidence for my eyes 3 then I say that basically what we

963
00:57:23,609 --> 00:57:25,950
eyes 3 then I say that basically what we need to prove is to let's say that X for

964
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:32,240
need to prove is to let's say that X for all right exploits in the final text 1

965
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:32,250


966
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:37,800
you actually you know so okay so this is the evidence right so we improve our

967
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,089
the evidence right so we improve our exports in defender of x2 and x1 Topshop

968
00:57:42,089 --> 00:57:43,980
exports in defender of x2 and x1 Topshop are you going to drink this how you

969
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,720
are you going to drink this how you gonna prove that given explain that

970
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,260
gonna prove that given explain that exports independent effects to without

971
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:55,070
exports independent effects to without doing any calculations

972
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:55,080


973
00:57:55,080 --> 00:58:02,470
but remove the algorithm that makes war angry

974
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:02,480


975
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,520
so what situation do we have killed with the arrows in this evidence no this is

976
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,970
the arrows in this evidence no this is what Henson tell you all right so if you

977
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:12,660
what Henson tell you all right so if you throw a ball look and no trees observe

978
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,800
throw a ball look and no trees observe what happens when you throw the ball

979
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:20,980
what happens when you throw the ball from x264 the pocket no all right so

980
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,300
from x264 the pocket no all right so it's sports independent XP sing with me

981
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,210
it's sports independent XP sing with me if I put a little extra on when it rates

982
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:32,620
if I put a little extra on when it rates extreme I want to probe in the pencil

983
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,510
extreme I want to probe in the pencil for X 4 for X 1 so if I throw and we're

984
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,609
for X 4 for X 1 so if I throw and we're from extraordinaire its X 3

985
00:58:36,609 --> 00:58:39,790
from extraordinaire its X 3 yes because this node is not observe but

986
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:43,380
yes because this node is not observe but popular tax free

987
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:43,390


988
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:50,380
ok so now this tutorial example I think you take it for granted but you know if

989
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,780
you take it for granted but you know if I start making fancy connections between

990
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,900
I start making fancy connections between the norms mister very easy algorithm to

991
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,550
the norms mister very easy algorithm to prove independence without having to do

992
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,829
prove independence without having to do any calculations by hand and mayors

993
00:58:59,829 --> 00:59:02,740
any calculations by hand and mayors against assuming to give you a platform

994
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:06,970
against assuming to give you a platform work to work on this thing okay so all

995
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:09,430
work to work on this thing okay so all right an issue because it's sort of an

996
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:16,780
right an issue because it's sort of an important way of doing this ok again

997
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,329
important way of doing this ok again showing in this case with a dispatcher

998
00:59:19,329 --> 00:59:28,960
showing in this case with a dispatcher right with a tail and tail and observe

999
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:28,970


1000
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:33,040
okay what no I'm sorry it's okay it's not at this time sir

1001
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,079
not at this time sir this is this is the four o'clock sir

1002
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:38,290
this is this is the four o'clock sir rights and fail and fail and observe the

1003
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:42,400
rights and fail and fail and observe the path is blocked for I didn't observe the

1004
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,490
path is blocked for I didn't observe the part is unblocked okay so in this case

1005
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:48,430
part is unblocked okay so in this case of the fourth given why actions they're

1006
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:49,690
of the fourth given why actions they're independent

1007
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:55,480
independent if why some observe that you know if in

1008
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,829
if why some observe that you know if in this case you can see that the

1009
00:59:56,829 --> 00:59:58,510
this case you can see that the probability affection see margarine

1010
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:02,859
probability affection see margarine basically you know this is not equal to

1011
01:00:02,859 --> 01:00:13,250
basically you know this is not equal to P of X x gives independence

1012
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:13,260


1013
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:18,950
and again vistas this is the most difficult case certificate I have two

1014
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:23,510
difficult case certificate I have two causes of why if the part is blocked

1015
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,849
causes of why if the part is blocked when y is nothing self that's the

1016
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:27,890
when y is nothing self that's the opposite from all the previous cases if

1017
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,630
opposite from all the previous cases if Y is observed in the both can walk

1018
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:33,730
Y is observed in the both can walk through all right

1019
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:33,740


1020
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:40,760
okay so again goes to its opposite from the other case x and z are marginally

1021
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,700
the other case x and z are marginally independent but you can try to establish

1022
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,700
independent but you can try to establish basically initial independence given the

1023
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:55,130
basically initial independence given the evidence Y X is not independent you okay

1024
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:58,940
evidence Y X is not independent you okay and we talked about this let's

1025
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:01,970
and we talked about this let's concentrate on this on this example

1026
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:04,820
concentrate on this on this example right they need anything because you

1027
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,530
right they need anything because you know I have no idea with the space here

1028
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,750
know I have no idea with the space here okay because we need to think together

1029
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:12,859
okay because we need to think together here so you can help me as you aspiring

1030
01:01:12,859 --> 01:01:15,410
here so you can help me as you aspiring speaking here so in this case I have

1031
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,630
speaking here so in this case I have nothing observed and I thought well for

1032
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,700
nothing observed and I thought well for next can you tell me what happens step

1033
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,070
next can you tell me what happens step by step and maybe if you don't remember

1034
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:25,870
by step and maybe if you don't remember we go back to all the previous slides

1035
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:25,880


1036
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:32,630
from from X and I want to see where this not hasn't involved

1037
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:35,030
not hasn't involved so what is my extraction phase of the

1038
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:38,330
so what is my extraction phase of the structure all right so this is

1039
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:41,480
structure all right so this is unobserved alright so what happens to

1040
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,050
unobserved alright so what happens to the both look nervous to the to the path

1041
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:48,260
the both look nervous to the to the path here when I look at the two arrows being

1042
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:55,850
here when I look at the two arrows being down like that

1043
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:55,860


1044
01:01:55,860 --> 01:02:07,120
can I go from X to Y no because those are observed can I move over from X to W

1045
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:07,130


1046
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:16,490
can I go from X to W yeah because mrs. Stetson tale based on observed life is

1047
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:20,510
Stetson tale based on observed life is Pakistan block okay then I mixed loudly

1048
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:22,130
Pakistan block okay then I mixed loudly and what happens to the volume down to

1049
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:25,370
and what happens to the volume down to you when that me is not observed goes up

1050
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,700
you when that me is not observed goes up so the ball is lost they never come back

1051
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,260
so the ball is lost they never come back okay tell me now what happens when I

1052
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,890
okay tell me now what happens when I observed that me you

1053
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:37,000
observed that me you so obviously the volume there all right

1054
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,940
so obviously the volume there all right you know we don't say anything

1055
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:42,200
you know we don't say anything stimulus situation so the ball comes

1056
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:46,480
stimulus situation so the ball comes here okay what happens this from zero

1057
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,800
here okay what happens this from zero from our bounding conditions the mall

1058
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,350
from our bounding conditions the mall comes back and then this one observed

1059
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:55,070
comes back and then this one observed the wall was too wide to here

1060
01:02:55,070 --> 01:03:01,900
the wall was too wide to here what can we say about x and y given W

1061
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:01,910


1062
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:09,730
so we have this RR is the x and y in the separated and both the list can reach Y

1063
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:12,250
separated and both the list can reach Y so what can you tell me when that B is

1064
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:19,420
so what can you tell me when that B is observed so in order for next year it's

1065
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:22,150
observed so in order for next year it's Y all right so this is the Ritz ability

1066
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:28,300
Y all right so this is the Ritz ability condition so annoying W is more or less

1067
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:31,540
condition so annoying W is more or less the same as knowing easy and you can

1068
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,100
the same as knowing easy and you can remember from the destructor

1069
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,650
remember from the destructor knowing this the evidence makes notes x

1070
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:42,610
knowing this the evidence makes notes x and y what makes them dependent right

1071
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,880
and y what makes them dependent right because anything we say about X or Y

1072
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,340
because anything we say about X or Y imply something about yoga okay

1073
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:52,060
imply something about yoga okay all right so here the take apart is any

1074
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,620
all right so here the take apart is any information that you get down from

1075
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,840
information that you get down from chamber is basically four five eighths

1076
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,310
chamber is basically four five eighths half points and this is the tricky part

1077
01:03:57,310 --> 01:04:07,650
half points and this is the tricky part for this graphs

1078
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:07,660


1079
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:13,920
I know but the idea is right we're trying to see you know when interesting

1080
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,750
trying to see you know when interesting to go back from X to X right there is

1081
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,610
to go back from X to X right there is you know we want to stick its the

1082
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:20,930
you know we want to stick its the volcano rich wife Theresa part ever

1083
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:29,920
volcano rich wife Theresa part ever no Peppa okay

1084
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:29,930


1085
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:36,880
this is an example that you read if your target stays the same things and this is

1086
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,310
target stays the same things and this is a very nice example from Bishop's book

1087
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:43,599
a very nice example from Bishop's book actually about buzzes compilations for

1088
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:47,079
actually about buzzes compilations for this explaining away paste okay so I

1089
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:51,430
this explaining away paste okay so I remember I go through all the answer bra

1090
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:53,859
remember I go through all the answer bra and I believe I'm not sure but I think

1091
01:04:53,859 --> 01:04:55,359
and I believe I'm not sure but I think one of their former chrome works has

1092
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:59,530
one of their former chrome works has this something like this okay so there

1093
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:03,370
this something like this okay so there is a former problem but so certainly do

1094
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:05,050
is a former problem but so certainly do this homework and when we see the

1095
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:08,680
this homework and when we see the algebra algebra they say here in wrote

1096
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:12,609
algebra algebra they say here in wrote you've got zero point 1 1 1 then 0 1 1 1

1097
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:14,200
you've got zero point 1 1 1 then 0 1 1 1 because you will appreciate

1098
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,599
because you will appreciate but this numbers is not magic right

1099
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:19,870
but this numbers is not magic right there's not become basically by this

1100
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:21,880
there's not become basically by this condition of of abilities that we assume

1101
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,849
condition of of abilities that we assume them known and this prior okay so when

1102
01:05:24,849 --> 01:05:27,700
them known and this prior okay so when you do this algebra so in this case it's

1103
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,589
you do this algebra so in this case it's basically to the same example that we

1104
01:05:29,589 --> 01:05:31,480
basically to the same example that we will discuss in with the rain case

1105
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:35,050
will discuss in with the rain case alright so knowing that this is 0

1106
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:37,349
alright so knowing that this is 0 somehow saying something about B

1107
01:05:37,349 --> 01:05:39,730
somehow saying something about B produces the probability that this left

1108
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:43,930
produces the probability that this left is 0 all right since we explained the

1109
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:47,740
is 0 all right since we explained the observation that I receive from Z this

1110
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:50,140
observation that I receive from Z this is a very nice example please

1111
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:55,800
is a very nice example please winded and do that calculation okay

1112
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:55,810


1113
01:05:55,810 --> 01:06:03,750
can you show me with the biggest Milan written that they even have right as my

1114
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:06,270
written that they even have right as my evidence is independent of B given a

1115
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:08,310
evidence is independent of B given a tell me what you will do with the

1116
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:16,060
tell me what you will do with the biggest ball algorithm

1117
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:16,070


1118
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:23,350
so terrible I fell beyond the rules can I reach and if this is true right mr.

1119
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,930
I reach and if this is true right mr. Sanford the ball is blocked right so no

1120
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:28,720
Sanford the ball is blocked right so no no wait because we believe we cannot

1121
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,480
no wait because we believe we cannot think it's like eating and blind being

1122
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:35,290
think it's like eating and blind being right Oh checking your phone when you

1123
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:37,540
right Oh checking your phone when you walk and then you expect me to pay

1124
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:40,320
walk and then you expect me to pay attention to you right the same thing

1125
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:47,980
attention to you right the same thing so a independent big given up you know

1126
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:49,900
so a independent big given up you know tell me about the ball so I like the

1127
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,790
tell me about the ball so I like the ball I say if I bought from a what

1128
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:54,850
ball I say if I bought from a what happens to it when it comes here then

1129
01:06:54,850 --> 01:07:00,820
happens to it when it comes here then the whole roll up left alright so the

1130
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:06,160
the whole roll up left alright so the motor is blocked right right because

1131
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:13,120
motor is blocked right right because this is unobserved okay so this part is

1132
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:18,790
this is unobserved okay so this part is blocked but anyways we verify was not

1133
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,650
blocked but anyways we verify was not the case and then one goes up there

1134
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:23,410
the case and then one goes up there because this to observe this part will

1135
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:26,350
because this to observe this part will also be blocked right so you know but

1136
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:34,319
also be blocked right so you know but not there

1137
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:34,329


1138
01:07:34,329 --> 01:07:39,569
okay this is sort of the same language or different waters exactly the same

1139
01:07:39,569 --> 01:07:48,230
or different waters exactly the same thing okay these are all the rules

1140
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:48,240


1141
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:53,030
now you may ask me why are the slides not liquid because you know sometimes I

1142
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:56,510
not liquid because you know sometimes I in here let's say 2005 I ride the slide

1143
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:59,720
in here let's say 2005 I ride the slide and that I forgot and then you have 2015

1144
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,870
and that I forgot and then you have 2015 I prefer something else and and then you

1145
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,160
I prefer something else and and then you get it's nothing it's nice but you know

1146
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,650
get it's nothing it's nice but you know what I like to keep that because when

1147
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:09,520
what I like to keep that because when you read them yes you put an extra page

1148
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,690
you read them yes you put an extra page but you may get something from the

1149
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:13,069
but you may get something from the different slide that seems to be the

1150
01:08:13,069 --> 01:08:15,440
different slide that seems to be the same but may have something different

1151
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:22,740
same but may have something different there okay

1152
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:22,750


1153
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:27,919
don't be pissed so some simple example just before we

1154
01:08:27,919 --> 01:08:29,329
so some simple example just before we finish the election today right we

1155
01:08:29,329 --> 01:08:31,030
finish the election today right we really have to take this

1156
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:39,309
really have to take this so this is the proportion if you collect

1157
01:08:39,309 --> 01:08:44,450
so this is the proportion if you collect data from iid data with little

1158
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:48,470
data from iid data with little innovation and something new what can be

1159
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:50,689
innovation and something new what can be something else actually this can be an

1160
01:08:50,689 --> 01:08:52,760
something else actually this can be an indicator variables no tells you what

1161
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,729
indicator variables no tells you what Gaussian in a mixture here's but the

1162
01:08:55,729 --> 01:08:58,820
Gaussian in a mixture here's but the idea here is would you look at the

1163
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:01,760
idea here is would you look at the probability of the data so these all the

1164
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:06,919
probability of the data so these all the collections of data x1 to xn each of

1165
01:09:06,919 --> 01:09:09,320
collections of data x1 to xn each of these the excise given you is

1166
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,260
these the excise given you is independent alright so this is the iid

1167
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:14,930
independent alright so this is the iid assumption that you guys use in every

1168
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:21,140
assumption that you guys use in every statistics course you pay and the idea

1169
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,660
statistics course you pay and the idea here is representation a graphical

1170
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,059
here is representation a graphical representation of the I I need property

1171
01:09:26,059 --> 01:09:30,200
representation of the I I need property is the simple graph with the city so can

1172
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,490
is the simple graph with the city so can somebody tell me just you know why this

1173
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:37,519
somebody tell me just you know why this graph basically invent this independence

1174
01:09:37,519 --> 01:09:39,769
graph basically invent this independence relation otherwise my x1 is independent

1175
01:09:39,769 --> 01:09:48,189
relation otherwise my x1 is independent of X 2

1176
01:09:48,189 --> 01:09:48,199


1177
01:09:48,199 --> 01:10:02,700
what is the only way to go from x1 to x2 in this case the broken arrow right

1178
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:02,710


1179
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:21,740
so wait when do I get this

1180
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:21,750


1181
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:26,990
so don't get coaster scared okay because my exes are my date obviously have to

1182
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,910
my exes are my date obviously have to mark them because that's my evidence

1183
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:32,540
mark them because that's my evidence right but when I write this relation and

1184
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:34,040
right but when I write this relation and I'm looking at this Malaysian my

1185
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,560
I'm looking at this Malaysian my evidence from public speakings what

1186
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,790
evidence from public speakings what right you know what variable when I say

1187
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:44,900
right you know what variable when I say three of the given moon right so if I

1188
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:47,479
three of the given moon right so if I want to welcome x1 to x2 I have to go

1189
01:10:47,479 --> 01:10:50,540
want to welcome x1 to x2 I have to go through the evidence new alright so I've

1190
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:54,380
through the evidence new alright so I've got another 2x2 the path from here is

1191
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,450
got another 2x2 the path from here is blocked all right

1192
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:58,790
blocked all right because I already know the values of me

1193
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:03,350
because I already know the values of me okay so you need to start get years to

1194
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:08,689
okay so you need to start get years to do this little drops basically that

1195
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:11,390
do this little drops basically that they're not just a sort of dummy doctor

1196
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:13,430
they're not just a sort of dummy doctor relations but they embed from holistic

1197
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:17,000
relations but they embed from holistic relationship so in essence when you have

1198
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,140
relationship so in essence when you have this graph immediately this is their

1199
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:23,570
this graph immediately this is their right so it's not one of the other once

1200
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:25,580
right so it's not one of the other once you plot it this is what immediately you

1201
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,740
you plot it this is what immediately you are implying that you have the iid

1202
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:28,430
are implying that you have the iid assumption

1203
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:32,300
assumption okay and you can obviously you know hear

1204
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:35,360
okay and you can obviously you know hear that if you might analyze me out all

1205
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:35,570
that if you might analyze me out all right

1206
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:38,689
right that marginally basically you can P of

1207
01:11:38,689 --> 01:11:40,550
that marginally basically you can P of me

1208
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:43,850
me it doesn't factor is P of X 1 P of X 2

1209
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:48,320
it doesn't factor is P of X 1 P of X 2 etc okay and so there's no really

1210
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:53,570
etc okay and so there's no really all right the basically you cannot you

1211
01:11:53,570 --> 01:11:57,439
all right the basically you cannot you cannot approve any independence so let's

1212
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,740
cannot approve any independence so let's do

1213
01:11:59,740 --> 01:11:59,750


1214
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:04,930
so again please maybe one of those trivial example so let's prove this all

1215
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:08,500
trivial example so let's prove this all right so we have evidence x2 and we want

1216
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,880
right so we have evidence x2 and we want to prove that X for two different

1217
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,440
to prove that X for two different effects on an extinct

1218
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,950
effects on an extinct okay so excuse my red Nestor we want to

1219
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:17,860
okay so excuse my red Nestor we want to say exports in the final factoid exit so

1220
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,780
say exports in the final factoid exit so with the biggest mall algorithm rather

1221
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:21,180
with the biggest mall algorithm rather than going to do

1222
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:23,770
than going to do all right so given X still we need to

1223
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:26,050
all right so given X still we need to prove those exports in the panel of X 1

1224
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:29,710
prove those exports in the panel of X 1 and X 6 so let's not miss X 1 the proof

1225
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:33,070
and X 6 so let's not miss X 1 the proof independence of export X 1 where your

1226
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:35,730
independence of export X 1 where your own role in the boy can go this way or

1227
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:39,700
own role in the boy can go this way or can go all the way like that so if the

1228
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:42,060
can go all the way like that so if the ball goes this way what happens here

1229
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:45,820
ball goes this way what happens here you know if the world goes this way then

1230
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:52,200
you know if the world goes this way then you know yes yes yes

1231
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:52,210


1232
01:12:52,210 --> 01:13:00,629
well you tell me what happens there

1233
01:13:00,629 --> 01:13:00,639


1234
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:14,699
so can I go from X chicks can I go to x2

1235
01:13:14,699 --> 01:13:14,709


1236
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:20,450
so we can know okay

1237
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:20,460


1238
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:27,770
but remember next text is the way that I say is a mismatch sir

1239
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:30,560
say is a mismatch sir all right so it's not observed it's not

1240
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:39,900
all right so it's not observed it's not observable missed

1241
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:39,910


1242
01:13:39,910 --> 01:14:04,050
if x6 is no observe what happens it's no okay and then from X to X is right this

1243
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:07,410
okay and then from X to X is right this is given and and then I'm working on

1244
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:08,580
is given and and then I'm working on this way and then it's you know

1245
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:11,760
this way and then it's you know protected too so this is true so you

1246
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,080
protected too so this is true so you know if you write to this sort of this

1247
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:16,170
know if you write to this sort of this calculation with the factorization of

1248
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:18,180
calculation with the factorization of the probability distribution it will

1249
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:20,310
the probability distribution it will take you basically half an hour or

1250
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:21,510
take you basically half an hour or something

1251
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:23,580
something if you dress this relationship you do

1252
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:25,950
if you dress this relationship you do they may be lost by it you don't have to

1253
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:34,920
they may be lost by it you don't have to bother again so let's finish so X 1

1254
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,630
bother again so let's finish so X 1 given X clinics the exponents in the

1255
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:43,320
given X clinics the exponents in the benefit sticks okay so it's no exponents

1256
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,910
benefit sticks okay so it's no exponents in the time no fixed is there two parts

1257
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:48,740
in the time no fixed is there two parts one part is this way is this parking lot

1258
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:56,370
one part is this way is this parking lot yes right now is this part yes not here

1259
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:59,540
yes right now is this part yes not here it states that given X for Linux state

1260
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:05,430
it states that given X for Linux state x2 is not independent extreme so given X

1261
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:07,830
x2 is not independent extreme so given X 1 X 6 roll it a little more like this

1262
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:10,290
1 X 6 roll it a little more like this the more can walk from this distraction

1263
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:13,860
the more can walk from this distraction why because this is observed then the

1264
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:16,140
why because this is observed then the more can go there can go to explain

1265
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:17,730
more can go there can go to explain there is a path so this going the

1266
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:18,620
there is a path so this going the backwards

1267
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:23,660
backwards okay

1268
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:23,670


1269
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:31,140
all right so this is the biggest model thing in action for a must know

1270
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:35,280
thing in action for a must know computation problems okay

1271
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,400
computation problems okay let me just finish what's 144 so I don't

1272
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:42,230
let me just finish what's 144 so I don't know what's my last slide because I had

1273
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:45,240
know what's my last slide because I had and we're going to come back from on

1274
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:53,670
and we're going to come back from on this would do the slides on Thursday but

1275
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:55,350
this would do the slides on Thursday but I went basically to summarize the same

1276
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:57,450
I went basically to summarize the same slide that had before for now in

1277
01:15:57,450 --> 01:16:00,090
slide that had before for now in addition to this local the northern and

1278
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:02,550
addition to this local the northern and lack of property I also put this

1279
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:07,440
lack of property I also put this deceleration property okay you know

1280
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:11,550
deceleration property okay you know which is you know sort of a graph

1281
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:13,950
which is you know sort of a graph theoretic way of separating a set of

1282
01:16:13,950 --> 01:16:15,900
theoretic way of separating a set of notes a from beginner so main evidence

1283
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,870
notes a from beginner so main evidence shall any the say if I throw this

1284
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:22,100
shall any the say if I throw this property this global map of property

1285
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:25,650
property this global map of property ecology this is an ahkam directed by the

1286
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:27,240
ecology this is an ahkam directed by the profit division is the order Markov

1287
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:32,370
profit division is the order Markov property and if you can solve the G next

1288
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:35,070
property and if you can solve the G next 12 leads to old and then you can

1289
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:36,750
12 leads to old and then you can actually show the opposite which is not

1290
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:39,870
actually show the opposite which is not trivial but only 12 Nick stingy all of

1291
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:42,420
trivial but only 12 Nick stingy all of them relatively well if you could put

1292
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:45,630
them relatively well if you could put one you can write the other two okay and

1293
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:48,810
one you can write the other two okay and also you can solve the poultry basically

1294
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:51,180
also you can solve the poultry basically lead to the same factorization of the

1295
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:52,740
lead to the same factorization of the Joint Distribution the graph which is

1296
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:54,980
Joint Distribution the graph which is the relation that you share the body

1297
01:16:54,980 --> 01:17:01,110
the relation that you share the body okay so this sort of is you know

1298
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:03,180
okay so this sort of is you know something easy to remember this is way

1299
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:05,820
something easy to remember this is way more powerful basically because in

1300
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:08,250
more powerful basically because in essence doesn't really even care what

1301
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,990
essence doesn't really even care what are the non descendants invert the

1302
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:12,210
are the non descendants invert the direction of the arrow says although the

1303
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,850
direction of the arrow says although the numbering of the

1304
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:17,520
numbering of the right so this made separation actually

1305
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,040
right so this made separation actually can be applied to both directed and

1306
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,739
can be applied to both directed and undirected graphs and it is the way to

1307
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:24,770
undirected graphs and it is the way to prove condition independence to this

1308
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:27,149
prove condition independence to this again if you want the top of each of

1309
01:17:27,149 --> 01:17:29,219
again if you want the top of each of these we're learning this this you have

1310
01:17:29,219 --> 01:17:31,889
these we're learning this this you have shown them at least with examples the

1311
01:17:31,889 --> 01:17:35,159
shown them at least with examples the truth is very few lines and again you

1312
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:38,359
truth is very few lines and again you can consult one of the Bible's in in

1313
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:40,739
can consult one of the Bible's in in community graphical models for people

1314
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:44,189
community graphical models for people okay 1:46 we will come back and and

1315
01:17:44,189 --> 01:17:46,469
okay 1:46 we will come back and and three some slides and then discuss about

1316
01:17:46,469 --> 01:17:49,709
three some slides and then discuss about the elimination algorithm when we return

1317
01:17:49,709 --> 01:17:52,019
the elimination algorithm when we return on Thursday
