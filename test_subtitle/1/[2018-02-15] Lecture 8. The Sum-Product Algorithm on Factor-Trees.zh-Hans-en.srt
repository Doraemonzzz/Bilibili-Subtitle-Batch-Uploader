00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,270
能够计算此消息，您需要计算来自的消息
be able to compute this messages you need to compute the messages coming from

126
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:18,280
能够计算此消息，您需要计算来自的消息
need to compute the messages coming from that syndrome and then to compute those

127
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,610
该综合症，然后计算那些混乱，您必须继续下降
need to compute the messages coming from that syndrome and then to compute those

128
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,860
该综合症，然后计算那些混乱，您必须继续下降
that syndrome and then to compute those mess you have to keep going down

129
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:21,870
该综合症，然后计算那些混乱，您必须继续下降
mess you have to keep going down eventually this will take me down to the

130
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,939
最终，这将带我到树叶上，这就是为什么收集
mess you have to keep going down eventually this will take me down to the

131
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:27,420
最终，这将带我到树叶上，这就是为什么收集
eventually this will take me down to the leaves and that's why the collect

132
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:27,430
最终，这将带我到树叶上，这就是为什么收集
leaves and that's why the collect algorithm you noticed

133
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,560
您注意到它是递归算法，所以您
leaves and that's why the collect algorithm you noticed

134
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,409
您注意到它是递归算法，所以您
algorithm you noticed it's the recursive algorithm so you

135
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:31,419
您注意到它是递归算法，所以您
it's the recursive algorithm so you start from the root and then you go one

136
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:34,080
从根开始，然后每次向下走一步，直到基本上
it's the recursive algorithm so you start from the root and then you go one

137
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,770
从根开始，然后每次向下走一步，直到基本上
start from the root and then you go one step down at a time until basically you

138
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:37,780
从根开始，然后每次向下走一步，直到基本上
step down at a time until basically you are at the bottom and you can already

139
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,390
位于底部，您已经可以开始收集邮件了，所以您
step down at a time until basically you are at the bottom and you can already

140
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,340
位于底部，您已经可以开始收集邮件了，所以您
are at the bottom and you can already start collecting messages okay so you

141
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:44,350
位于底部，您已经可以开始收集邮件了，所以您
start collecting messages okay so you don't have to write any fantastic

142
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,719
不必编写任何出色的算法，这是一条运河，但这是
start collecting messages okay so you don't have to write any fantastic

143
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,969
不必编写任何出色的算法，这是一条运河，但这是
don't have to write any fantastic algorithm this is a canal but it's

144
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:47,979
不必编写任何出色的算法，这是一条运河，但这是
algorithm this is a canal but it's basically for you know connecting the

145
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:51,900
基本上，您知道连接消息就能发送消息
algorithm this is a canal but it's basically for you know connecting the

146
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,650
基本上，您知道连接消息就能发送消息
basically for you know connecting the messages to be able to send a message

147
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:54,660
基本上，您知道连接消息就能发送消息
messages to be able to send a message from Ted why you need to have all the

148
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,140
从泰德（Ted）出发，为什么您需要让所有传入的船只到达我们的旅程中
messages to be able to send a message from Ted why you need to have all the

149
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,260
从泰德（Ted）出发，为什么您需要让所有传入的船只到达我们的旅程中
from Ted why you need to have all the incoming vessels arriving in our journey

150
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,270
从泰德（Ted）出发，为什么您需要让所有传入的船只到达我们的旅程中
incoming vessels arriving in our journey okay

151
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,409
好的，所以这是收集的，类似的
incoming vessels arriving in our journey okay

152
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:05,940
好的，所以这是收集的，类似的
okay so so this is the collect and similarly

153
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:05,950
好的，所以这是收集的，类似的
so so this is the collect and similarly the distributed messaging algorithm you

154
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,810
您可以在此处看到的分布式消息传递算法满足所有消息
so so this is the collect and similarly the distributed messaging algorithm you

155
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,300
您可以在此处看到的分布式消息传递算法满足所有消息
the distributed messaging algorithm you can see here it meets all the messages

156
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,310
您可以在此处看到的分布式消息传递算法满足所有消息
can see here it meets all the messages arrive at the route then you are ready

157
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,629
到达路线，然后您就可以开始从路线发送消息了
can see here it meets all the messages arrive at the route then you are ready

158
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:17,520
到达路线，然后您就可以开始从路线发送消息了
arrive at the route then you are ready to start sending messages from the route

159
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:17,530
到达路线，然后您就可以开始从路线发送消息了
to start sending messages from the route down to the stillness of the route all

160
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,550
一直到路线的宁静，一直到树叶
to start sending messages from the route down to the stillness of the route all

161
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,089
一直到路线的宁静，一直到树叶
down to the stillness of the route all the way down to the leaves so if you you

162
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:24,099
一直到路线的宁静，一直到树叶
the way down to the leaves so if you you can send this message and then the

163
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:27,480
可以发送此消息，然后分发算法基本上是
the way down to the leaves so if you you can send this message and then the

164
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,040
可以发送此消息，然后分发算法基本上是
can send this message and then the distribute algorithm is basically

165
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,050
可以发送此消息，然后分发算法基本上是
distribute algorithm is basically propagated and again the propagating of

166
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,330
传播，并且消息的传播也完全相同
distribute algorithm is basically propagated and again the propagating of

167
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,560
传播，并且消息的传播也完全相同
propagated and again the propagating of messages follows exactly the same

168
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:34,570
传播，并且消息的传播也完全相同
messages follows exactly the same commands that you know messages go up or

169
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,290
您知道消息的命令是向上还是向下的，特别是相同的命令
messages follows exactly the same commands that you know messages go up or

170
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,760
您知道消息的命令是向上还是向下的，特别是相同的命令
commands that you know messages go up or down specially the same commanders

171
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:38,770
您知道消息的命令是向上还是向下的，特别是相同的命令
down specially the same commanders disappear okay so the only thing have to

172
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,550
消失好了，所以传播消息时唯一要记住的是
down specially the same commanders disappear okay so the only thing have to

173
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,350
消失好了，所以传播消息时唯一要记住的是
disappear okay so the only thing have to keep in mind when you propagate message

174
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
消失好了，所以传播消息时唯一要记住的是
keep in mind when you propagate message from J to I and your countlessly for the

175
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,200
从J到我，还有您无数个，让收到的邮件说出您是否不
keep in mind when you propagate message from J to I and your countlessly for the

176
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,450
从J到我，还有您无数个，让收到的邮件说出您是否不
from J to I and your countlessly for the incoming messages to say if you don't

177
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:48,460
从J到我，还有您无数个，让收到的邮件说出您是否不
incoming messages to say if you don't account for the best is coming from I so

178
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,800
最好的帐户来自我，所以他们不会发送尝试我的大师
incoming messages to say if you don't account for the best is coming from I so

179
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,510
最好的帐户来自我，所以他们不会发送尝试我的大师
account for the best is coming from I so they're not gonna send try the Masters I

180
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:54,520
最好的帐户来自我，所以他们不会发送尝试我的大师
they're not gonna send try the Masters I sent you okay this is from the mental to

181
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,960
寄给你好吧，这是从心理到
they're not gonna send try the Masters I sent you okay this is from the mental to

182
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,040
寄给你好吧，这是从心理到
sent you okay this is from the mental to this

183
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,050
寄给你好吧，这是从心理到
this masters parsing algorithms so eventually

184
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:05,240
掌握解析算法，因此最终收集步骤基本上可以解决所有问题
this masters parsing algorithms so eventually

185
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,820

186
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:08,830
掌握解析算法，因此最终收集步骤基本上可以解决所有问题
the collect step basically you go all the way down until you start sending

187
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,980
直到您开始向根发送消息，然后从
the collect step basically you go all the way down until you start sending

188
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,960
直到您开始向根发送消息，然后从
the way down until you start sending messages to the root and then from the

189
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:12,970
直到您开始向根发送消息，然后从
messages to the root and then from the root you all the way down to the leaf

190
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,430
一直扎根到树叶，发送消息显示每个边缘
messages to the root and then from the root you all the way down to the leaf

191
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,369
一直扎根到树叶，发送消息显示每个边缘
root you all the way down to the leaf sending messages showing every edge at

00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:17,379
一直扎根到树叶，发送消息显示每个边缘
sending messages showing every edge at the end of the day you're going to have

193
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:18,480
一天结束时，您将收到双向的消息，我们
sending messages showing every edge at the end of the day you're going to have

194
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,589
一天结束时，您将收到双向的消息，我们
the end of the day you're going to have messages in both directions okay and we

195
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:22,599
一天结束时，您将收到双向的消息，我们
messages in both directions okay and we already have Punta based for threads if

196
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:26,100
如果您有此竞赛引擎，则已经有基于Punta的线程
messages in both directions okay and we already have Punta based for threads if

197
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,689
如果您有此竞赛引擎，则已经有基于Punta的线程
already have Punta based for threads if you want if you have this race engine

198
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:27,699
如果您有此竞赛引擎，则已经有基于Punta的线程
you want if you have this race engine you want to try to compute the marginal

199
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:29,460
您想要尝试计算给定的边际数，而不必要做的唯一事情
you want if you have this race engine you want to try to compute the marginal

200
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,490
您想要尝试计算给定的边际数，而不必要做的唯一事情
you want to try to compute the marginal of a given no the only thing you have to

201
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:32,500
您想要尝试计算给定的边际数，而不必要做的唯一事情
of a given no the only thing you have to do is multiply all the messages

202
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,800
要做的就是将所有幸存的消息乘以该音符乘以
of a given no the only thing you have to do is multiply all the messages

203
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,469
要做的就是将所有幸存的消息乘以该音符乘以
do is multiply all the messages surviving to that note times the

204
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:37,479
要做的就是将所有幸存的消息乘以该音符乘以
surviving to that note times the potential but not the normalized okay so

205
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:44,579
潜力，但不是正常化的，所以，我们已经讨论了一些
surviving to that note times the potential but not the normalized okay so

206
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:47,160
潜力，但不是正常化的，所以，我们已经讨论了一些
potential but not the normalized okay so and we already discuss a few ones that

207
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,170
潜力，但不是正常化的，所以，我们已经讨论了一些
and we already discuss a few ones that say the Joint Distribution of I and J

208
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,990
说我和J的联合分布，你知道你可以写一个
and we already discuss a few ones that say the Joint Distribution of I and J

209
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,600
说我和J的联合分布，你知道你可以写一个
say the Joint Distribution of I and J you know you can sort of write a single

210
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:54,610
说我和J的联合分布，你知道你可以写一个
you know you can sort of write a single algorithm with what we derive for change

211
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:59,150
我们可以从中得出变化的算法，所以您可以再次选择任何路线
you know you can sort of write a single algorithm with what we derive for change

212
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:06,030
我们可以从中得出变化的算法，所以您可以再次选择任何路线
algorithm with what we derive for change okay so again you choose any route you

213
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,040
我们可以从中得出变化的算法，所以您可以再次选择任何路线
okay so again you choose any route you send messages from the names to the

214
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,699
将消息从名称发送到路线，然后从道路发送到
okay so again you choose any route you send messages from the names to the

215
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:12,240
将消息从名称发送到路线，然后从道路发送到
send messages from the names to the route and then from the road down to the

216
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,250
将消息从名称发送到路线，然后从道路发送到
route and then from the road down to the links and and and then that's it

217
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,370
链接，然后就是这样
route and then from the road down to the links and and and then that's it

218
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,930
我提到过，因此，如果您尝试
route and then from the road down to the links and and and then that's it

219
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:18,940
我提到过，因此，如果您尝试


220
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,910
我提到过，因此，如果您尝试
I mentioned that so this algorithm is basically portrays if you try to

221
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
我提到过，因此，如果您尝试
basically portrays if you try to generalize this in principle it may work

222
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,820
概括地说，它可能会正常工作，因此即使您没有树
basically portrays if you try to generalize this in principle it may work

223
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,610
概括地说，它可能会正常工作，因此即使您没有树
generalize this in principle it may work right so even if you don't have a tree

224
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:29,620
概括地说，它可能会正常工作，因此即使您没有树
right so even if you don't have a tree and you try to use the same idea you

225
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,580
然后您尝试使用相同的想法，将其称为根，然后开始
right so even if you don't have a tree and you try to use the same idea you

226
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,700
然后您尝试使用相同的想法，将其称为根，然后开始
and you try to use the same idea you call something the root and you start

227
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:35,710
然后您尝试使用相同的想法，将其称为根，然后开始
call something the root and you start sending messages you know you hold it

228
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,000
发送消息，您知道您持有该信息，您说过我会与您同在
call something the root and you start sending messages you know you hold it

229
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,650
发送消息，您知道您持有该信息，您说过我会与您同在
sending messages you know you hold it over one point you said I stay with you

230
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:40,660
发送消息，您知道您持有该信息，您说过我会与您同在
over one point you said I stay with you and you send messages from the list all

231
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,140
然后您从列表开始一直发送消息，反之亦然
over one point you said I stay with you and you send messages from the list all

232
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,720
然后您从列表开始一直发送消息，反之亦然
and you send messages from the list all the way up and the other way around this

233
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:45,730
然后您从列表开始一直发送消息，反之亦然
the way up and the other way around this may work even if you have loose okay but

234
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,600
即使您没有问题也可以工作，但我不是真正的反对者
the way up and the other way around this may work even if you have loose okay but

235
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,130
即使您没有问题也可以工作，但我不是真正的反对者
may work even if you have loose okay but I'm not the antis that actually will

236
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:50,140
即使您没有问题也可以工作，但我不是真正的反对者
I'm not the antis that actually will work okay and the reflections of the

237
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,610
工作还可以，声音的反射会因为包括什么而引起担忧
I'm not the antis that actually will work okay and the reflections of the

238
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,290
工作还可以，声音的反射会因为包括什么而引起担忧
work okay and the reflections of the sound worried from including what is

239
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:55,300
工作还可以，声音的反射会因为包括什么而引起担忧
sound worried from including what is called loopy belief propagation that

240
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,830
所谓的循环信念传播，基本上是在一天结束时
sound worried from including what is called loopy belief propagation that

241
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,990
所谓的循环信念传播，基本上是在一天结束时
called loopy belief propagation that basically at the end of the day do the

242
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,000
所谓的循环信念传播，基本上是在一天结束时
basically at the end of the day do the same message passing in some systematic

243
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,410
相同的消息以某种系统的方式传递，然后，因为他们看到了
basically at the end of the day do the same message passing in some systematic

244
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,440
相同的消息以某种系统的方式传递，然后，因为他们看到了
same message passing in some systematic manner and then because they saw what if

245
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:07,450
相同的消息以某种系统的方式传递，然后，因为他们看到了
manner and then because they saw what if they keep going forever you just stop it

246
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,810
他们永远走下去，只要在消息出现的某个时间停止它
manner and then because they saw what if they keep going forever you just stop it

247
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,430
他们永远走下去，只要在消息出现的某个时间停止它
they keep going forever you just stop it at a certain time when the messages

248
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
他们永远走下去，只要在消息出现的某个时间停止它
at a certain time when the messages don't change very much and you call that

249
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,650
并没有太大的改变，你称这是故事的结尾，希望能取得最好的成绩
at a certain time when the messages don't change very much and you call that

250
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,760
并没有太大的改变，你称这是故事的结尾，希望能取得最好的成绩
don't change very much and you call that the end of the story hoping for the best

251
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:16,770
并没有太大的改变，你称这是故事的结尾，希望能取得最好的成绩
the end of the story hoping for the best okay

252
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,650
好吧，很多年前，我知道我们那时
the end of the story hoping for the best okay

253
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:23,210
好吧，很多年前，我知道我们那时
okay many years ago I you know when we were

254
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:23,220
好吧，很多年前，我知道我们那时
many years ago I you know when we were writing a proposal somehow I I got

255
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,210
我以某种方式撰写提案II对于这种Loopy概念感到兴奋
many years ago I you know when we were writing a proposal somehow I I got

256
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,010
我以某种方式撰写提案II对于这种Loopy概念感到兴奋
writing a proposal somehow I I got excited about this concept of loopy

257
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,020
我以某种方式撰写提案II对于这种Loopy概念感到兴奋
excited about this concept of loopy belief propagation and I told all this

258
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,160
信念传播，我告诉所有这位数学家，所以你知道我们必须使用
excited about this concept of loopy belief propagation and I told all this

259
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,900
信念传播，我告诉所有这位数学家，所以你知道我们必须使用
belief propagation and I told all this mathematician so you know we have to use

260
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:33,910
信念传播，我告诉所有这位数学家，所以你知道我们必须使用
mathematician so you know we have to use this loopy belief algorithm and

261
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,480
这个循环的信念算法，每个人都不知道我在说什么
mathematician so you know we have to use this loopy belief algorithm and

262
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,920
这个循环的信念算法，每个人都不知道我在说什么
this loopy belief algorithm and everybody had no idea what I was talking

263
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:37,930
这个循环的信念算法，每个人都不知道我在说什么
everybody had no idea what I was talking because looping means crazy okay

264
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,880
因为循环意味着疯狂还可以，但显然这并不是丢人的事
everybody had no idea what I was talking because looping means crazy okay

265
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,180
因为循环意味着疯狂还可以，但显然这并不是丢人的事
because looping means crazy okay but obviously here is not a disgrace it

266
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:45,190
因为循环意味着疯狂还可以，但显然这并不是丢人的事
but obviously here is not a disgrace it means there are loops okay but it's all

267
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,120
意味着有循环就可以了，但这都是相对的
but obviously here is not a disgrace it means there are loops okay but it's all

268
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,770
意味着有循环就可以了，但这都是相对的
means there are loops okay but it's all relative

269
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:49,780
意味着有循环就可以了，但这都是相对的
relative they always may go crazy if you have

270
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,510
如果循环良好，它们可能总是会发疯，所以一种坐下的方式
relative they always may go crazy if you have

271
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,780
如果循环良好，它们可能总是会发疯，所以一种坐下的方式
they always may go crazy if you have loops all right so one way you sit on

272
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:54,790
如果循环良好，它们可能总是会发疯，所以一种坐下的方式
loops all right so one way you sit on the other you get the same message

273
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,679
另一个，您会收到相同的消息，因此，如果您有向图，您会
loops all right so one way you sit on the other you get the same message

274
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:07,900
另一个，您会收到相同的消息，因此，如果您有向图，您会
the other you get the same message so if you have a directed graph what you

275
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:07,910
另一个，您会收到相同的消息，因此，如果您有向图，您会
so if you have a directed graph what you have even though it is a tree like when

276
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,139
即使它是一棵树，就像当您转换为无向图时一样
so if you have a directed graph what you have even though it is a tree like when

277
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,519
即使它是一棵树，就像当您转换为无向图时一样
have even though it is a tree like when you transform into an undirected graph

278
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:12,529
即使它是一棵树，就像当您转换为无向图时一样
you transform into an undirected graph you have to marry the parent so if you

279
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:14,889
你必须要嫁给父母，所以如果你有两个父母，基本上他们直接
you transform into an undirected graph you have to marry the parent so if you

280
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:17,199
你必须要嫁给父母，所以如果你有两个父母，基本上他们直接
you have to marry the parent so if you have two parents basically them directly

281
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:17,209
你必须要嫁给父母，所以如果你有两个父母，基本上他们直接
have two parents basically them directly God is going to have loops okay so one

282
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:22,179
上帝会好起来的，所以摆脱这个问题的一种简单方法
have two parents basically them directly God is going to have loops okay so one

283
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:25,299
上帝会好起来的，所以摆脱这个问题的一种简单方法
God is going to have loops okay so one easy way to get away from this problem

284
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:25,309
上帝会好起来的，所以摆脱这个问题的一种简单方法
easy way to get away from this problem without using this concept of look at

285
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,160
不使用这个概念，而是看一下新的传播方式
easy way to get away from this problem without using this concept of look at

286
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,590
不使用这个概念，而是看一下新的传播方式
without using this concept of look at the new propagation is to transform this

287
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
不使用这个概念，而是看一下新的传播方式
the new propagation is to transform this graph to what is called a factor graph

288
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,859
图到所谓的因子图，基本上是一个即时的想法
the new propagation is to transform this graph to what is called a factor graph

the factor graph from a given Direction graph is not a unique contract so you

366
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:15,769
图不是唯一合同，因此您实际上可以有多个路径
the factor graph from a given Direction graph is not a unique contract so you

367
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,119
图不是唯一合同，因此您实际上可以有多个路径
graph is not a unique contract so you can have actually multiple paths to

368
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:17,129
图不是唯一合同，因此您实际上可以有多个路径
can have actually multiple paths to graph ok and nothing really to worry at

369
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:22,039
图好，至少在这个类的上下文中没有什么真正担心的，所以
can have actually multiple paths to graph ok and nothing really to worry at

370
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,389
图好，至少在这个类的上下文中没有什么真正担心的，所以
graph ok and nothing really to worry at least in the context of this class so

371
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:23,399
图好，至少在这个类的上下文中没有什么真正担心的，所以
least in the context of this class so for example here remember we have the

372
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,900
例如在这里，请记住，我们在一个因素上具有摩擦方面的影响
least in the context of this class so for example here remember we have the

373
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,059
例如在这里，请记住，我们在一个因素上具有摩擦方面的影响
for example here remember we have the effect of friction aspectual on a factor

374
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:29,069
例如在这里，请记住，我们在一个因素上具有摩擦方面的影响
effect of friction aspectual on a factor for its to write and the part of that

375
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,249
为其撰写内容，而其中的一部分涉及此处的三个论点
effect of friction aspectual on a factor for its to write and the part of that

376
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:33,319
为其撰写内容，而其中的一部分涉及此处的三个论点
for its to write and the part of that involves the three arguments here you

377
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:33,329
为其撰写内容，而其中的一部分涉及此处的三个论点
involves the three arguments here you know what I do is I only use one factor

378
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:35,479
知道我在做什么，我只使用一个因素，因为这个因素涉及三个因素
involves the three arguments here you know what I do is I only use one factor

379
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,919
知道我在做什么，我只使用一个因素，因为这个因素涉及三个因素
know what I do is I only use one factor because this factor involves the three

380
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:36,929
知道我在做什么，我只使用一个因素，因为这个因素涉及三个因素
because this factor involves the three arguments I could pose to be

381
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:39,439
作为第二部分的一部分，我可能会提出将x表示为深情P的论点
because this factor involves the three arguments I could pose to be

382
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,659
作为第二部分的一部分，我可能会提出将x表示为深情P的论点
arguments I could pose to be affectionate P of x2 as part of the

383
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:41,669
作为第二部分的一部分，我可能会提出将x表示为深情P的论点
affectionate P of x2 as part of the biggest part of involves from three

384
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:43,249
涉及的最大部分来自三个，所以这是一门课程
affectionate P of x2 as part of the biggest part of involves from three

385
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,539
涉及的最大部分来自三个，所以这是一门课程
biggest part of involves from three together alright so this is one course

386
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:47,549
涉及的最大部分来自三个，所以这是一门课程
together alright so this is one course but this is what we saw before right the

387
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:51,470
但这就是我们之前看到的一样，所以这两个是不同的
together alright so this is one course but this is what we saw before right the

388
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:57,229
但这就是我们之前看到的一样，所以这两个是不同的
but this is what we saw before right the same so this two are different okay in

389
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:57,239
但这就是我们之前看到的一样，所以这两个是不同的
same so this two are different okay in this case I suppose the cost of doing

390
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:59,710
在这种情况下，我认为进行类似这样的推断的成本是
same so this two are different okay in this case I suppose the cost of doing

391
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,029
在这种情况下，我认为进行类似这样的推断的成本是
this case I suppose the cost of doing inference of something like this or

392
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:02,039
在这种情况下，我认为进行类似这样的推断的成本是
inference of something like this or something like that it's practically the

393
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:04,489
类似的东西实际上是一样的，因为您注意到这里您知道
inference of something like this or something like that it's practically the

394
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:07,039
类似的东西实际上是一样的，因为您注意到这里您知道
something like that it's practically the same because you notice here you know

395
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:07,049
类似的东西实际上是一样的，因为您注意到这里您知道
same because you notice here you know you have three variables and here you

396
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:08,449
您有三个变量，在这里您有三个变量，所以我们将
same because you notice here you know you have three variables and here you

397
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,210
您有三个变量，在这里您有三个变量，所以我们将
you have three variables and here you have three variables so we'll so that is

398
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:11,220
您有三个变量，在这里您有三个变量，所以我们将
have three variables so we'll so that is what defines the complexity of the

399
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,710
什么定义了问题的复杂性
have three variables so we'll so that is what defines the complexity of the

400
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,400
什么定义了问题的复杂性
what defines the complexity of the problem

401
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:13,410
什么定义了问题的复杂性
problem but it's somehow you can write this

402
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,620
但是您可以用某种方式编写这些内容而无需那些仅需花费两个时间的内容
problem but it's somehow you can write this

403
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,960
但是您可以用某种方式编写这些内容而无需那些仅需花费两个时间的内容
but it's somehow you can write this without those that have only to take two

404
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:18,970
但是您可以用某种方式编写这些内容而无需那些仅需花费两个时间的内容
without those that have only to take two arguments that would be the best way but

405
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,300
可能是最好的方法，但您不能在这里这样做，因为其中之一
without those that have only to take two arguments that would be the best way but

406
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,290
可能是最好的方法，但您不能在这里这样做，因为其中之一
arguments that would be the best way but you cannot do it here because one of the

407
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:24,300
可能是最好的方法，但您不能在这里这样做，因为其中之一
you cannot do it here because one of the probabilities is your X 3 given X 1 and

408
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,300
概率是给定X 1和X 2的X 3，因此您还需要一个3的因数
you cannot do it here because one of the probabilities is your X 3 given X 1 and

409
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,080
概率是给定X 1和X 2的X 3，因此您还需要一个3的因数
probabilities is your X 3 given X 1 and X 2 so you need a factor of also 3

410
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,090
概率是给定X 1和X 2的X 3，因此您还需要一个3的因数
X 2 so you need a factor of also 3 arguments again variable nodes these are

411
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:36,480
再次将变量节点作为参数，这是因子说明，它们的功能还可以
X 2 so you need a factor of also 3 arguments again variable nodes these are

412
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,390
再次将变量节点作为参数，这是因子说明，它们的功能还可以
arguments again variable nodes these are factor notes their functions all right

413
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:41,400
再次将变量节点作为参数，这是因子说明，它们的功能还可以
factor notes their functions all right [Applause]

414
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,580
[掌声]
factor notes their functions all right [Applause]

415
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,860
所以例如在这种情况下，让我们在直接获得
factor notes their functions all right [Applause]

416
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:45,870
所以例如在这种情况下，让我们在直接获得


417
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:52,490
所以例如在这种情况下，让我们在直接获得
so for example in in this case right so let's look so before we had the directly

418
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:52,500
所以例如在这种情况下，让我们在直接获得
let's look so before we had the directly graph here we have an undirected graph

419
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,350
图这里我们有一个无向图，所以我们有一个涉及节点的集团
let's look so before we had the directly graph here we have an undirected graph

420
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,560
图这里我们有一个无向图，所以我们有一个涉及节点的集团
graph here we have an undirected graph so we have a clique that involves nodes

421
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:57,570
图这里我们有一个无向图，所以我们有一个涉及节点的集团
so we have a clique that involves nodes 1 &amp; 2 so there is a potential of X 1 and

422
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,250
1＆2，所以有一个X 1和X 2的电势，那么我们有一个集团涉及2
so we have a clique that involves nodes 1 &amp; 2 so there is a potential of X 1 and

423
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,070
1＆2，所以有一个X 1和X 2的电势，那么我们有一个集团涉及2
1 &amp; 2 so there is a potential of X 1 and X 2 and then we have a clique involves 2

424
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:04,080
1＆2，所以有一个X 1和X 2的电势，那么我们有一个集团涉及2
X 2 and then we have a clique involves 2 3 &amp; 4 so vivid potential of 3 variables

425
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,220
3和4具有3个变量的潜力，因此图表的一部分非常简单
X 2 and then we have a clique involves 2 3 &amp; 4 so vivid potential of 3 variables

426
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,040
3和4具有3个变量的潜力，因此图表的一部分非常简单
3 &amp; 4 so vivid potential of 3 variables so the part of graph is very simple

427
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,050
3和4具有3个变量的潜力，因此图表的一部分非常简单
so the part of graph is very simple there is a factor of they are the

428
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,360
其中有一个因素是连接X 1 X 2
so the part of graph is very simple there is a factor of they are the

429
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,490
其中有一个因素是连接X 1 X 2
there is a factor of they are the connect X 1 X 2 that's explicitly this

430
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:13,500
其中有一个因素是连接X 1 X 2
connect X 1 X 2 that's explicitly this function and then there is another

431
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,420
功能，然后有连接2 3＆4的另一个粒子
connect X 1 X 2 that's explicitly this function and then there is another

432
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,600
功能，然后有连接2 3＆4的另一个粒子
function and then there is another particles of connect 2 3 &amp; 4

433
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,920
是的，就像我说的，几张照片将对应于相同的无方向性
function and then there is another particles of connect 2 3 &amp; 4

434
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:24,930
是的，就像我说的，几张照片将对应于相同的无方向性


435
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:30,470
是的，就像我说的，几张照片将对应于相同的无方向性
right and as I said several photographs would correspond to the same undirected

436
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
是的，就像我说的，几张照片将对应于相同的无方向性
would correspond to the same undirected graph so in this case you know there is

437
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,130
图，因此在这种情况下，您知道只需单击一下即可收集所有X
would correspond to the same undirected graph so in this case you know there is

438
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,070
图，因此在这种情况下，您知道只需单击一下即可收集所有X
graph so in this case you know there is only one click so you can collect all X

439
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:37,080
图，因此在这种情况下，您知道只需单击一下即可收集所有X
only one click so you can collect all X 1 X 2 X 3 to the others in one factor

440
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,890
1 X 2 X 3给其他人一个因素，但是在这里您知道实际上您可以做到
only one click so you can collect all X 1 X 2 X 3 to the others in one factor

441
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,829
1 X 2 X 3给其他人一个因素，但是在这里您知道实际上您可以做到
1 X 2 X 3 to the others in one factor but here you know actually you can do

442
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:42,839
1 X 2 X 3给其他人一个因素，但是在这里您知道实际上您可以做到
but here you know actually you can do weird things and split it in the factor

443
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,440
怪异的事物并将其拆分为3因子，当然也是如此
but here you know actually you can do weird things and split it in the factor

444
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,900
怪异的事物并将其拆分为3因子，当然也是如此
weird things and split it in the factor of 3 and also factors to so of course

445
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:47,910
怪异的事物并将其拆分为3因子，当然也是如此
of 3 and also factors to so of course you're not going to gain anything with

446
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,130
你不会从我们这里获得任何好处，但这是另一个故事
of 3 and also factors to so of course you're not going to gain anything with

447
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,880
你不会从我们这里获得任何好处，但这是另一个故事
you're not going to gain anything with us but that's another story

448
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:51,890
你不会从我们这里获得任何好处，但这是另一个故事
us but that's another story so at this time directed graph right and

449
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:57,560
因此，此时定向图正确，并看到该图生气了
us but that's another story so at this time directed graph right and

450
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,510
因此，此时定向图正确，并看到该图生气了
so at this time directed graph right and look a pissed-off the graph and this

451
00:16:59,510 --> 00:16:59,520
因此，此时定向图正确，并看到该图生气了
look a pissed-off the graph and this factor block and don't read what it says

452
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,850
因子块，不要读那里说的话，这在计算上更好
look a pissed-off the graph and this factor block and don't read what it says

453
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,549
因子块，不要读那里说的话，这在计算上更好
factor block and don't read what it says there which is computationally better to

454
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:04,559
因子块，不要读那里说的话，这在计算上更好
there which is computationally better to work with

455
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,980
与...合作
there which is computationally better to work with

456
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,650
不，不要读这个好吧，我没有时间去做一个遗漏
there which is computationally better to work with

457
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:11,660
不，不要读这个好吧，我没有时间去做一个遗漏


458
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:17,110
不，不要读这个好吧，我没有时间去做一个遗漏
no don't read this okay I don't have time to go and make an omission from the

459
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
不，不要读这个好吧，我没有时间去做一个遗漏
time to go and make an omission from the slides right life you store any

460
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,819
滑倒你的生活，你存储任何使这些客户复杂的东西
time to go and make an omission from the slides right life you store any

461
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,220
滑倒你的生活，你存储任何使这些客户复杂的东西
slides right life you store any complicated making these clients so

462
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,230
滑倒你的生活，你存储任何使这些客户复杂的东西
complicated making these clients so Mitchell twelve this part of everything

463
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,850
米切尔十二这一切的一切都是机密的，格雷厄姆更容易
complicated making these clients so Mitchell twelve this part of everything

464
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,530
米切尔十二这一切的一切都是机密的，格雷厄姆更容易
Mitchell twelve this part of everything is confidential and graham easier to

465
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:26,540
米切尔十二这一切的一切都是机密的，格雷厄姆更容易
is confidential and graham easier to work with for inference this or not and

466
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,230
与之合作以推断出这一点，以及为什么大卫最容易成为基督徒
is confidential and graham easier to work with for inference this or not and

467
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:37,230
与之合作以推断出这一点，以及为什么大卫最容易成为基督徒
work with for inference this or not and why David easiest Christian ethnic

468
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:37,240
与之合作以推断出这一点，以及为什么大卫最容易成为基督徒
why David easiest Christian ethnic alright I'm sorry to kill her now you're

469
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,480
好吧，我很抱歉现在要杀死她，你是如此有名，你知道世界各地的你
why David easiest Christian ethnic alright I'm sorry to kill her now you're

470
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,850
好吧，我很抱歉现在要杀死她，你是如此有名，你知道世界各地的你
alright I'm sorry to kill her now you're so famous you know around the world you

471
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:45,860
好吧，我很抱歉现在要杀死她，你是如此有名，你知道世界各地的你
so famous you know around the world you know all the Chinese think who is the

472
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,230
知道所有中国人都认为谁是尼克
so famous you know around the world you know all the Chinese think who is the

473
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,010
知道所有中国人都认为谁是尼克
know all the Chinese think who is the guy Nick

474
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:48,020
知道所有中国人都认为谁是尼克
guy Nick you know so maybe we should turn the

475
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,170
你知道所以也许我们应该转动相机，所以这不是最好的选择
guy Nick you know so maybe we should turn the

476
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:58,120
你知道所以也许我们应该转动相机，所以这不是最好的选择
you know so maybe we should turn the camera so this is not the best option

477
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,690
我的意思是，当您正确比较两者时，
you know so maybe we should turn the camera so this is not the best option

478
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:01,700
我的意思是，当您正确比较两者时，


479
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:07,600
我的意思是，当您正确比较两者时，
I mean when you compare the two right what is different in the in the in the

480
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:07,610
我的意思是，当您正确比较两者时，
what is different in the in the in the two photographs here this pastor is

481
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:11,950
这里有两位牧师的照片，欢迎大家注意三点，让我们说
what is different in the in the in the two photographs here this pastor is

482
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,760
这里有两位牧师的照片，欢迎大家注意三点，让我们说
two photographs here this pastor is welcome any notes three so let's say

483
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:15,770
这里有两位牧师的照片，欢迎大家注意三点，让我们说
welcome any notes three so let's say each of these variables has K value so

484

so let's just do one final example and we leave it there so this is a directed

507
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:05,380
所以让我们做一个最后的例子，我们把它留在那里，这是一个有针对性的
we leave it there so this is a directed graph okay and this is sort of it's an

508
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,169
图形好，这有点像是古董摘要，我想我你知道我
we leave it there so this is a directed graph okay and this is sort of it's an

00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,480
像对待你
potential there okay so is this looking like a treating you

572
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,570
他在玩耍时记住，从你到其他正常人只有一条路
potential there okay so is this looking like a treating you

path from you known to any other normal but here we're not looking Anya the

576
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,320
但是在这里，我们不是在寻找Anya的有价值的注释，这些注释也要纳入
path from you known to any other normal but here we're not looking Anya the

but here we're not looking Anya the valuable notes were to incorporate also

578
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:44,279
但是在这里，我们不是在寻找Anya的有价值的注释，这些注释也要纳入
valuable notes were to incorporate also the fact to note so if part of knowledge

579
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,999
要注意的事实，如果您认为它们是知识和变量节点的一部分
valuable notes were to incorporate also the fact to note so if part of knowledge

580
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:50,450
要注意的事实，如果您认为它们是知识和变量节点的一部分
the fact to note so if part of knowledge and variable nodes if you think of them

581
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:50,460
要注意的事实，如果您认为它们是知识和变量节点的一部分
and variable nodes if you think of them as just different sets of notes you know

582
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,749
作为不同的音符集，您知道这是一棵树，所以问题是
and variable nodes if you think of them as just different sets of notes you know

583
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:56,539
作为不同的音符集，您知道这是一棵树，所以问题是
as just different sets of notes you know this is a tree okay so the question is

584
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:56,549
作为不同的音符集，您知道这是一棵树，所以问题是
this is a tree okay so the question is how can we do sort of inference and how

585
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:00,649
我们如何进行推理以及如何扩展求和积算法
this is a tree okay so the question is how can we do sort of inference and how

586
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:02,529
我们如何进行推理以及如何扩展求和积算法
how can we do sort of inference and how we can extend the sum-product algorithm

587
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:02,539
我们如何进行推理以及如何扩展求和积算法
we can extend the sum-product algorithm this part okay that's another example of

588
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:08,359
这部分还可以，这是12的另一个示例，但我们将其做成一棵树
we can extend the sum-product algorithm this part okay that's another example of

589
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,729
这部分还可以，这是12的另一个示例，但我们将其做成一棵树
this part okay that's another example of 12 but we make it to a tree

590
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:10,739
这部分还可以，这是12的另一个示例，但我们将其做成一棵树
12 but we make it to a tree okay so let's discuss what the algorithm

591
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:16,759
好吧，让我们讨论一下算法的外观，这是唯一的
12 but we make it to a tree okay so let's discuss what the algorithm

592
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,859
好吧，让我们讨论一下算法的外观，这是唯一的
okay so let's discuss what the algorithm is going to look like so the only thing

593
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:18,869
好吧，让我们讨论一下算法的外观，这是唯一的
is going to look like so the only thing I am going to need right now is the

594
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:22,430
我现在需要的是联合分配的分解
is going to look like so the only thing I am going to need right now is the

595
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,830
我现在需要的是联合分配的分解
I am going to need right now is the decomposition of the Joint Distribution

596
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:23,840
我现在需要的是联合分配的分解
decomposition of the Joint Distribution as a product for factors and this will

597
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,999
作为因素的乘积，这基本上是我平方的知识
decomposition of the Joint Distribution as a product for factors and this will

598
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:31,190
作为因素的乘积，这基本上是我平方的知识
as a product for factors and this will be my squared knowledge basically each

599
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,200
作为因素的乘积，这基本上是我平方的知识
be my squared knowledge basically each of these factors in principle okay

600
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,529
这些因素原则上还可以，所以这里是关节的分解
be my squared knowledge basically each of these factors in principle okay

601
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:38,840
这些因素原则上还可以，所以这里是关节的分解

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:38,850
这些因素原则上还可以，所以这里是关节的分解
so here is a decomposition of the Joint Distribution and you notice I have after

603
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,210
分布，您注意到我得到帮助后涉及两个变量

don't really need this don't really need this I am gonna bypass all of this and

617
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,010
好的，所以我们需要讨论如何在程序上产生一些
don't really need this don't really need this I am gonna bypass all of this and

00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:29,300
好的，所以我们需要讨论如何在程序上产生一些
all right so we need to discuss how we're gonna do incurring some on program

620
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:29,620
他将在概念上变得复杂，所以您需要

623
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,250
他将在概念上变得复杂，所以您需要
complicated right so you need to get used to visualize as to what is going on

624
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:39,470
用于可视化正在发生的事情以及消息的定义
complicated right so you need to get used to visualize as to what is going on

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,010
没关系，有时候我们有一个问题，您会注意到
have an out that and you notice there's no text is unrolled here and we need to

632
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:55,920
这里没有文字展开，我们需要计算X的边距，所以在
compute the marginal of X okay so in principle this is basically integrating

633
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,790
原则上，这基本上是整合所有其他变量，但很少有X
compute the marginal of X okay so in principle this is basically integrating

位置好，所以这里没有周围的一切，因为对不起
surrounded by factors because okay sorry I'm looking now to this factor FS all

645
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,880
我现在正在考虑这个因素FS，现在想想，如果您选择这3个

647
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:35,460
我现在正在考虑这个因素FS，现在想想，如果您选择这3个
right now think if you take this 3 and you put X on the top it is a three

648
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,850
您将X放在顶部，这是一个三写，所有这部分都将是

653
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:48,350
降为三分之三，而这三分首先来自工厂
originates from the factory first because strictly this is a three all

654
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:52,010
因为严格来说这是三个，所以我们可以看一下这个等式
originates from the factory first because strictly this is a three all

655
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:55,280
因为严格来说这是三个，所以我们可以看一下这个等式
because strictly this is a three all right so can we look at this equation

656
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,290
因为严格来说这是三个，所以我们可以看一下这个等式
right so can we look at this equation and and before I go to the next slide

657
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,980
在我转到下一张幻灯片之前，告诉我它们是什么功能
right so can we look at this equation and and before I go to the next slide

00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,550
就像是什么，你需要给我一个方程式，但总之
tell me what is this function they are going to be like what is it you need to

661
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,980
就像是什么，你需要给我一个方程式，但总之
going to be like what is it you need to give me an equation but looking at short

662
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:06,990
就像是什么，你需要给我一个方程式，但总之
give me an equation but looking at short it's reached here the Joint Distribution

663
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,990
到达此处所有轴的联合分布是这些轴的乘积

到达此处所有轴的联合分布是这些轴的乘积
of all the axis is the product of these functions would subscribe this so all a

666
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,040
功能将订阅此信息，因此我们邻居的所有系统

功能将订阅此信息，因此我们邻居的所有系统
functions would subscribe this so all a system of our neighbors

668
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,190
功能将订阅此信息，因此我们邻居的所有系统
system of our neighbors so far in fact those that the neighbors

671
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:23,409
到目前为止，事实上，那些受到邻居影响的因素
affect so this factor and that factor and that factor etc invisible if you

672
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:28,919
如果看不到该因子，则该因子将变为1/3。
affect so this factor and that factor and that factor etc invisible if you

674
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,090
如果看不到该因子，则该因子将变为1/3。
look at that factor you get 1/3 if you look at this factor another tree if you

675
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,180
看看这个因素，另一棵树，如果你看看另一个消散，那该怎么办
look at that factor you get 1/3 if you look at this factor another tree if you

677
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:36,370
看看这个因素，另一棵树，如果你看看另一个消散，那该怎么办
look about another dissipate so what do you think is F subscript the first

678
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,399
您认为F下标是第一个小X逗号大写字母X，是第一个

00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,440
好吧，我的意思是说这是消除
have been integrated out except little X ok makes sense

845
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,980
好吧，我的意思是说这是消除
ok makes sense I mean this is that the elimination

846
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:50,990
好吧，我的意思是说这是消除
I mean this is that the elimination Albert right we need to eliminate so

847
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:53,380
阿尔伯特（Albert）对，我们需要消除，所以我们要做的是消除其中的三个

阿尔伯特（Albert）对，我们需要消除，所以我们要做的是消除其中的三个
Albert right we need to eliminate so what we do is eliminate in it some three

849
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,210
阿尔伯特（Albert）对，我们需要消除，所以我们要做的是消除其中的三个
what we do is eliminate in it some three affiliated with this factor that

850
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,620
与这个因素有关，邻居知道X还可以，我们可以
what we do is eliminate in it some three affiliated with this factor that

851
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,650
与这个因素有关，邻居知道X还可以，我们可以
affiliated with this factor that neighbors known X okay and we can do

852
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:02,660
与这个因素有关，邻居知道X还可以，我们可以
neighbors known X okay and we can do this elimination here separately because

853
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,890
在此单独消除，因为一旦有了此规则，它就可以消除
neighbors known X okay and we can do this elimination here separately because

that comes from a factor to another such a weird concept right because mr. body

862
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,500
一个怪异的概念吧，因为先生。身体会在我们说话之前就知道
that comes from a factor to another such a weird concept right because mr. body

00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:30,960
能够说出很多道理，所以让我们看看还有什么原因令您不满意
what is further why don't you all right so we defined this okay now we need to

894
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,919
所以我们定义好了，现在我们需要定义一个因素的信息
what is further why don't you all right so we defined this okay now we need to

895
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:37,830
所以我们定义好了，现在我们需要定义一个因素的信息
so we defined this okay now we need to define the message of goes from a factor

896
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:37,840
所以我们定义好了，现在我们需要定义一个因素的信息
define the message of goes from a factor to a note okay

897
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,029

to find the message that this part of nonsense to review next this is a

921
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,569
废话不多说，接下来这是我们投资的一项功能，还可以
to find the message that this part of nonsense to review next this is a

922
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:39,990
废话不多说，接下来这是我们投资的一项功能，还可以
nonsense to review next this is a function we invest is a function alright

923
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,000
废话不多说，接下来这是我们投资的一项功能，还可以
function we invest is a function alright so this a function what we the thing is

924
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,379
因此，根据我们讨论的内容，此功能就是我们所谓的XM x sm的通用功能
function we invest is a function alright so this a function what we the thing is

925
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:48,450
因此，根据我们讨论的内容，此功能就是我们所谓的XM x sm的通用功能
so this a function what we the thing is GM of XM x sm based on what we discussed

926
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:48,460
因此，根据我们讨论的内容，此功能就是我们所谓的XM x sm的通用功能
GM of XM x sm based on what we discussed you know with a similar relation we

927
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,680
您知道我们以前讨论过的事实具有相似的关系
GM of XM x sm based on what we discussed you know with a similar relation we

您知道我们以前讨论过的事实具有相似的关系
discussed for a fact from before with the 3 appeared so what do you think so

930
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:56,799
3出现了，所以您怎么看，所以在这里我需要考虑所有
discussed for a fact from before with the 3 appeared so what do you think so

931
00:34:56,799 --> 00:34:58,299
3出现了，所以您怎么看，所以在这里我需要考虑所有
the 3 appeared so what do you think so here i need to account for all the

932
00:34:58,299 --> 00:34:58,309
3出现了，所以您怎么看，所以在这里我需要考虑所有
here i need to account for all the potentials right involved on this

933
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:01,990
这个子树上涉及的电位，我唯一拥有的就是
here i need to account for all the potentials right involved on this

934
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,120
这个子树上涉及的电位，我唯一拥有的就是
potentials right involved on this subtree and the only thing I have is

935
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,130
这个子树上涉及的电位，我唯一拥有的就是
subtree and the only thing I have is this factor in the nose that is being

936
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,339
这个在鼻子上被收集的因素

这个在鼻子上被收集的因素
this factor in the nose that is being collected

938
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:06,980
这个在鼻子上被收集的因素
collected so I have to account from whatever comes

939
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,490
所以我必须从它的狭窄带来的任何事情来解释，所以有一天
collected so I have to account from whatever comes

940
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,039
所以我必须从它的狭窄带来的任何事情来解释，所以有一天
so I have to account from whatever comes with its narrow so one day the thing is

941
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:12,049
所以我必须从它的狭窄带来的任何事情来解释，所以有一天
with its narrow so one day the thing is GM affects mx7 in simple words will be

942
00:35:12,049 --> 00:35:20,980
通用汽车用简单的话语影响mx7将会是我所看到的结果的产物
with its narrow so one day the thing is GM affects mx7 in simple words will be

943
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,670
通用汽车用简单的话语影响mx7将会是我所看到的结果的产物
GM affects mx7 in simple words will be the product of what I mean I see this

944
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:24,680
通用汽车用简单的话语影响mx7将会是我所看到的结果的产物
the product of what I mean I see this node next time right that is one of the

945
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,680
下一次右节点，它是与第一个节点相连的节点之一
the product of what I mean I see this node next time right that is one of the

946
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,780
下一次右节点，它是与第一个节点相连的节点之一
node next time right that is one of the nodes connecting with the first except

947
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:28,790
下一次右节点，它是与第一个节点相连的节点之一
nodes connecting with the first except that so this would be what

948
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,559
所以这就是
nodes connecting with the first except that so this would be what

949
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:38,470
显然，分享肯定有三权，所以我用通用汽车表示的事实
nodes connecting with the first except that so this would be what

950
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:38,480
显然，分享肯定有三权，所以我用通用汽车表示的事实


951
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:45,840
显然，分享肯定有三权，所以我用通用汽车表示的事实
obviously share there must be a three right so the fact that I denoted with GM

952
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:45,850
显然，分享肯定有三权，所以我用通用汽车表示的事实
right so the fact that I denoted with GM XL and then capital x sm the notation

953
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:51,610
XL，然后大写x sm，表示法看起来类似于我们的记法
right so the fact that I denoted with GM XL and then capital x sm the notation

954
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,050
XL，然后大写x sm，表示法看起来类似于我们的记法
XL and then capital x sm the notation looks to be similar to what we had

955
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:53,060
XL，然后大写x sm，表示法看起来类似于我们的记法
looks to be similar to what we had before so what do you think it is

956
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,050
在此之前，您认为这是什么，XM那里的下标是什么意思
looks to be similar to what we had before so what do you think it is

957
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,110
在此之前，您认为这是什么，XM那里的下标是什么意思
before so what do you think it is so what does subscript there XM means

958
00:35:59,110 --> 00:35:59,120
在此之前，您认为这是什么，XM那里的下标是什么意思
so what does subscript there XM means basically what I'm looking on the sub

959
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,240
基本上，我在当年的子树上寻找的是
so what does subscript there XM means basically what I'm looking on the sub

960
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,320
基本上，我在当年的子树上寻找的是
basically what I'm looking on the sub tree of the year you would know that

961
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:02,330
基本上，我在当年的子树上寻找的是
tree of the year you would know that time what is capital affects yourself

962
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:07,210
时间什么是资本会影响到你自己
tree of the year you would know that time what is capital affects yourself

963
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,430
这是所有涉及的节点都没有子树的步骤，为什么
tree of the year you would know that time what is capital affects yourself

964
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:08,440
这是所有涉及的节点都没有子树的步骤，为什么


965
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,360
这是所有涉及的节点都没有子树的步骤，为什么
this is the step of all the nodes involved without the sub tree and why do

966
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:13,370
这是所有涉及的节点都没有子树的步骤，为什么
involved without the sub tree and why do I put the subscript s there to remind

967
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,940
我将下标放在此处以提醒自己该节点范围已启用
involved without the sub tree and why do I put the subscript s there to remind

968
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,260
我将下标放在此处以提醒自己该节点范围已启用
I put the subscript s there to remind myself that this node extent is enabled

969
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,270
我将下标放在此处以提醒自己该节点范围已启用
myself that this node extent is enabled at first because I'm interested figure

970
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:22,390
首先是因为我有兴趣弄清楚事实或FS是什么消息
myself that this node extent is enabled at first because I'm interested figure

971
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,300
首先是因为我有兴趣弄清楚事实或FS是什么消息
at first because I'm interested figure out what is the message the fact or FS

972
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:25,310
首先是因为我有兴趣弄清楚事实或FS是什么消息
out what is the message the fact or FS sense to know that you need to know that

973
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,330
知道你需要知道我只是在看现时程度
out what is the message the fact or FS sense to know that you need to know that

974
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,880
知道你需要知道我只是在看现时程度
sense to know that you need to know that I'm only looking at the nonce extent

975
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:30,890
知道你需要知道我只是在看现时程度
I'm only looking at the nonce extent that are connected with a factor

976
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,740
与一个附加的因素相关联，好吧，好吧，所以你知道我要去
I'm only looking at the nonce extent that are connected with a factor

977
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:38,710
与一个附加的因素相关联，好吧，好吧，所以你知道我要去
that are connected with a factor attached okay okay so you know I'm gonna

978
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:38,720
与一个附加的因素相关联，好吧，好吧，所以你知道我要去
attached okay okay so you know I'm gonna have you know I'm gonna have something

979
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,740
你知道我要去密歇根州吗，好吧，因为
attached okay okay so you know I'm gonna have you know I'm gonna have something

980
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:47,080
你知道我要去密歇根州吗，好吧，因为
have you know I'm gonna have something like that Michigan okay you know because

981
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,090
你知道我要去密歇根州吗，好吧，因为
like that Michigan okay you know because we shan't you know we have this

982
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:51,630
我们难道不知道我们拥有这种与权利相关的潜能吗？
like that Michigan okay you know because we shan't you know we have this

983
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:57,550
我们难道不知道我们拥有这种与权利相关的潜能吗？
we shan't you know we have this potential affiliated with right so like

984
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:57,560
我们难道不知道我们拥有这种与权利相关的潜能吗？
potential affiliated with right so like this like that though explicitly

985
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,490
像这样，虽然基本上是在正确之前，我们采取了
potential affiliated with right so like this like that though explicitly

986
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,630
像这样，虽然基本上是在正确之前，我们采取了
this like that though explicitly basically before right we took

987
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:04,640
像这样，虽然基本上是在正确之前，我们采取了
basically before right we took everything affiliated with a factor of s

988
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,630
与s因子相关的所有事物都可以，但是现在通过认证的结果是
basically before right we took everything affiliated with a factor of s

989
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,360
与s因子相关的所有事物都可以，但是现在通过认证的结果是
everything affiliated with a factor of s all right but now certified revealed is

990
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:10,370
与s因子相关的所有事物都可以，但是现在通过认证的结果是
all right but now certified revealed is now sexual act etc so I can write it

991
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,510
现在发生性行为，等等，所以我可以写出短得又大又不同的东西，所以这是
all right but now certified revealed is now sexual act etc so I can write it

992
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:17,950
现在发生性行为，等等，所以我可以写出短得又大又不同的东西，所以这是
now sexual act etc so I can write it short awfully big differently so this is

993
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:17,960
现在发生性行为，等等，所以我可以写出短得又大又不同的东西，所以这是
short awfully big differently so this is exactly what we had before

994
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,590
正是我们之前拥有的一切，现在我要做的是
short awfully big differently so this is exactly what we had before

995
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:23,560
正是我们之前拥有的一切，现在我要做的是
exactly what we had before this is this all right now what I do is

996
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:23,570
正是我们之前拥有的一切，现在我要做的是
this is this all right now what I do is I write it as the popular test times G

997
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:29,980
我把它写成X大写的MG的流行测试时间G等
this is this all right now what I do is I write it as the popular test times G

998
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,930
我把它写成X大写的MG的流行测试时间G等
I write it as the popular test times G of at M G of X capital them etc

999
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:33,940
我把它写成X大写的MG的流行测试时间G等
of at M G of X capital them etc this ain't the same entity before then

1000
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,460
这不是同一实体，然后再看我正在看所有产品
of at M G of X capital them etc this ain't the same entity before then

1001
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,520
这不是同一实体，然后再看我正在看所有产品
this ain't the same entity before then look I was looking on the product of all

1002
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:41,530
这不是同一实体，然后再看我正在看所有产品
look I was looking on the product of all the factors affiliated with this country

1003
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:44,400
与这个国家相关的因素，所以现在我要做的就是
look I was looking on the product of all the factors affiliated with this country

1004
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,210
与这个国家相关的因素，所以现在我要做的就是
the factors affiliated with this country so now what I want to do is I want to

1005
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:48,220
与这个国家相关的因素，所以现在我要做的就是
so now what I want to do is I want to write this explicitly by having the

1006
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,730
被压迫明确地写出这个，所以我必须考虑到这一点
so now what I want to do is I want to write this explicitly by having the

1007
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,410
被压迫明确地写出这个，所以我必须考虑到这一点
write this explicitly by having the oppressed so I have to account for that

1008
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:54,420
被压迫明确地写出这个，所以我必须考虑到这一点
oppressed so I have to account for that times the product of this J products of

1009
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,490
乘以此J乘积的乘积与底物共同体的乘积

are you giving a Shadegg look all right charity and with it some to write down

1017
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:17,989
您是否在给Shadegg看起来不错的慈善事业，并把它写下来
charity and with it some to write down the product of all this functions so

1018
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:20,380
所有这些功能的乘积，所以这是一种不同的编写方式
charity and with it some to write down the product of all this functions so

1019
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:24,849
所有这些功能的乘积，所以这是一种不同的编写方式
the product of all this functions so this is a different way of writing it so

1020
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:24,960
如果您有兴趣从此因素完成消息，那么将非常有效
the product of all this functions so this is a different way of writing it so

so effectively if you're interested to complete the message from this factor to

1023
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,170
如果您有兴趣从此因素完成消息，那么将非常有效
complete the message from this factor to the node X what you have to do is in

1024
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,799
节点X您要做的是在表达式中他们要做的是
complete the message from this factor to the node X what you have to do is in

1025
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:34,509
节点X您要做的是在表达式中他们要做的是
the node X what you have to do is in that expression that they have to do is

1026
00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:34,519
节点X您要做的是在表达式中他们要做的是
that expression that they have to do is you have to integrate out the variables

1027
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:37,779
您必须正确整合变量x1 xn，因为您知道这是
that expression that they have to do is you have to integrate out the variables

1028
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:41,559
您必须正确整合变量x1 xn，因为您知道这是

00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,759
我所拥有的，但你也必须整合所有变量
what I have but also you have to integrate out all the variables

1032
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:45,769

1035
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:50,809
附属于哪个已经放置了哪些应该放置
placed which are should have put actually less there okay it's alright so

1036
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:54,039
实际上少一点好吧，没关系，所以我们让他们通过没有
placed which are should have put actually less there okay it's alright so

1037
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,900
实际上少一点好吧，没关系，所以我们让他们通过没有

1038
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:55,910
实际上少一点好吧，没关系，所以我们让他们通过没有
we have them to make that by without as well okay so before we had this times

1039
00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:02,829
好吧，所以在我们使用这个产品之前，现在我必须集成
we have them to make that by without as well okay so before we had this times

1040
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:05,470
好吧，所以在我们使用这个产品之前，现在我必须集成
well okay so before we had this times this product and now I have to integrate

1041
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:05,480
好吧，所以在我们使用这个产品之前，现在我必须集成
this product and now I have to integrate all the variables with little X to find

1042
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,660
所有带有小X的变量，以查找此因子发送给X的消息

the message that this factor sends to X so the product of x1 to XM has to be

1045
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,380
所以x1到XM的乘积必须在外面，因为这是X的函数
the message that this factor sends to X so the product of x1 to XM has to be

1046
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,809
所以x1到XM的乘积必须在外面，因为这是X的函数
so the product of x1 to XM has to be outside because this is a function of X

1047
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:16,819
所以x1到XM的乘积必须在外面，因为这是X的函数
outside because this is a function of X 1 X 10 and here I have to integrate out

1087
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,480
在这些条款中的每一个上消除餐馆
and this mess is remember claimed by eliminating restaurants on each of these

1088
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:38,990
在这些条款中的每一个上消除餐馆
eliminating restaurants on each of these terms

1089
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:39,000
在这些条款中的每一个上消除餐馆
terms okay so and then of course when you

1090
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,710
好的，然后当您将其相乘时，这个因子时间就是
terms okay so and then of course when you

1091
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,560
好的，然后当您将其相乘时，这个因子时间就是
okay so and then of course when you multiply this so this factor time is

1092
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:45,570
好的，然后当您将其相乘时，这个因子时间就是
multiply this so this factor time is these messages you have to integrate the

1093
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,720
这些消息，您必须将变量实际集成到
multiply this so this factor time is these messages you have to integrate the

1094
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,850
这些消息，您必须将变量实际集成到
these messages you have to integrate the variables actually to left half of the

1095
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:49,860
这些消息，您必须将变量实际集成到
variables actually to left half of the level out so what is left is a function

1096
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:53,510
变平，所以剩下的是小X的函数，这是来自
variables actually to left half of the level out so what is left is a function

1097
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,610
变平，所以剩下的是小X的函数，这是来自
level out so what is left is a function of little X and that's the message from

1098
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:55,620
变平，所以剩下的是小X的函数，这是来自
of little X and that's the message from a factor H to the bottom will non-visual

1099
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:00,140
底部的因子H将使非可见X再次有意义
of little X and that's the message from a factor H to the bottom will non-visual

1100
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:05,420
底部的因子H将使非可见X再次有意义
a factor H to the bottom will non-visual X makes a little sense again you know

1101
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:05,430
底部的因子H将使非可见X再次有意义
X makes a little sense again you know what I the way to say it is sort of

1102
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:09,850
我要说的是某种图形上的权利，如果通常写的话
X makes a little sense again you know what I the way to say it is sort of

1103
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:13,760
我要说的是某种图形上的权利，如果通常写的话
what I the way to say it is sort of graphical right and if usually write

1104
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:13,770
我要说的是某种图形上的权利，如果通常写的话
graphical right and if usually write something that's out of common sense you

1105
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,100
有些常识是不可能出错的，所以从
graphical right and if usually write something that's out of common sense you

1106
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,910
有些常识是不可能出错的，所以从
something that's out of common sense you cannot go wrong okay so the lessons from

1107
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:19,920
有些常识是不可能出错的，所以从
cannot go wrong okay so the lessons from lists from FS to X is this factor time

1108
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,130
从FS到X的列表是这个因素时间解决了这个问题的传入消息
cannot go wrong okay so the lessons from lists from FS to X is this factor time

1109
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,200
从FS到X的列表是这个因素时间解决了这个问题的传入消息
lists from FS to X is this factor time solve incoming messages to this factor

1110
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,210
从FS到X的列表是这个因素时间解决了这个问题的传入消息
solve incoming messages to this factor and then you have to get rid basically

1111
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,750
然后你必须摆脱它，因为这些混乱的每一个都是
solve incoming messages to this factor and then you have to get rid basically

1112
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,920
然后你必须摆脱它，因为这些混乱的每一个都是
and then you have to get rid basically because each of these messed is a

1113
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:30,930
然后你必须摆脱它，因为这些混乱的每一个都是
because each of these messed is a function of this nodes so you have to

1114
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,560
该节点的功能，因此您必须集成所有这些井头
because each of these messed is a function of this nodes so you have to

1115
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,140
该节点的功能，因此您必须集成所有这些井头
function of this nodes so you have to integrate all of this well tau

1116
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:35,150
该节点的功能，因此您必须集成所有这些井头
integrate all of this well tau okay and again you may say again what

1117
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:39,170
好吧，你可以再说一遍，这部分的其余部分是什么
integrate all of this well tau okay and again you may say again what

1118
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,520
好吧，你可以再说一遍，这部分的其余部分是什么
okay and again you may say again what are this rest of this piece of the

1119
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:40,530
好吧，你可以再说一遍，这部分的其余部分是什么
are this rest of this piece of the message wants to eliminate everything

1120
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,230
消息想要消除那些特定节点全部之后的所有内容
are this rest of this piece of the message wants to eliminate everything

1121
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:48,200
消息想要消除那些特定节点全部之后的所有内容
message wants to eliminate everything past what those particular node all

1122
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:48,210
消息想要消除那些特定节点全部之后的所有内容
past what those particular node all right

1123
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,360
正确的
past what those particular node all right

1124
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,660
所以我们拥有的就是让我回到两个方程式
past what those particular node all right

1125
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:51,670
所以我们拥有的就是让我回到两个方程式


1126
00:41:51,670 --> 00:42:00,120
所以我们拥有的就是让我回到两个方程式
so what we have is we have so let me go back to the two equations all right

1127
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:06,170
所以这里有一个方程式，我真的不希望这个方程式好，所以我们
so what we have is we have so let me go back to the two equations all right

1128
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:06,180
所以这里有一个方程式，我真的不希望这个方程式好，所以我们


1129
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:15,829
所以这里有一个方程式，我真的不希望这个方程式好，所以我们
so here we have an equation well I don't want this one actually okay so we've

1130
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:15,839
所以这里有一个方程式，我真的不希望这个方程式好，所以我们
want this one actually okay so we've basically discussed the way to propagate

1131
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:19,730
基本上讨论了从便笺事实传播消息的方式，
want this one actually okay so we've basically discussed the way to propagate

1132
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,339
基本上讨论了从便笺事实传播消息的方式，
basically discussed the way to propagate messages from the fact of your note and

1133
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:22,349
基本上讨论了从便笺事实传播消息的方式，
messages from the fact of your note and then from the know into your factor okay

1134
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:26,980
然后从了解到您的因素好吧
messages from the fact of your note and then from the know into your factor okay

1135
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,130
然后从了解到您的因素好吧
then from the know into your factor okay all right

1136
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:28,140
然后从了解到您的因素好吧
all right so actually I'm sorry from a notice let

1137
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,069
所以实际上我很抱歉收到通知，让我让我回到这还好吧，所以
all right so actually I'm sorry from a notice let

1138
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:34,160
所以实际上我很抱歉收到通知，让我让我回到这还好吧，所以
so actually I'm sorry from a notice let me let me just go back to this okay so

1139
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,170
所以实际上我很抱歉收到通知，让我让我回到这还好吧，所以
me let me just go back to this okay so if you want to find the message okay

1140
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,859
如果您想找到从XM到FS的消息还可以，那么从通知中
me let me just go back to this okay so if you want to find the message okay

1142
00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:41,579
如果您想找到从XM到FS的消息还可以，那么从通知中
from XM to FS all right so from a notice after be available to me this is the

1143
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:44,900
在对我可用之后，这是我们做的操作，我们被雷曼兄弟吃了
from XM to FS all right so from a notice after be available to me this is the

1144
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,999
在对我可用之后，这是我们做的操作，我们被雷曼兄弟吃了
after be available to me this is the operation we did right we Lehman ate it

1145
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:47,009
在对我可用之后，这是我们做的操作，我们被雷曼兄弟吃了
operation we did right we Lehman ate it on this sub tree we liberated this

1146
00:42:47,009 --> 00:42:49,160
在这个子树上，我们解放了这验证了声音的定义三
operation we did right we Lehman ate it on this sub tree we liberated this

1147
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,890
在这个子树上，我们解放了这验证了声音的定义三
on this sub tree we liberated this validates the sound definition three

1148
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:51,900
在这个子树上，我们解放了这验证了声音的定义三
validates the sound definition three lines there all right when we get me the

1149
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,589
当我得到变量的行时，行就可以了
validates the sound definition three lines there all right when we get me the

1150
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:56,720
当我得到变量的行时，行就可以了
lines there all right when we get me the for the variables both extend and get

1151
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:56,730
当我得到变量的行时，行就可以了
for the variables both extend and get basically the message from X term to the

1152
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:59,239
基本上是从X项到事实再到检验的消息
for the variables both extend and get basically the message from X term to the

1153

1154
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:00,150
基本上是从X项到事实再到检验的消息
fact to the test okay and you can write this explicitly

1155
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:05,210
好的，您可以明确地将其写成以下事实的乘积：
fact to the test okay and you can write this explicitly

00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:09,259
好的，您可以明确地将其写成以下事实的乘积：
okay and you can write this explicitly as the product of all the fact of

1157
00:43:09,259 --> 00:43:09,269
好的，您可以明确地将其写成以下事实的乘积：
as the product of all the fact of functions are creating with this sub 3m

00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:14,999
低于3m的功能正在创建，它们是电影般的余波，但是
they're a filmic afters but the factor appears because your interest to figure

1161
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:17,420
出现是因为您有兴趣弄清楚此节点发送的消息是什么
they're a filmic afters but the factor appears because your interest to figure

1162
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,700
出现是因为您有兴趣弄清楚此节点发送的消息是什么
appears because your interest to figure out what is the message this node sends

1163
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:19,710
出现是因为您有兴趣弄清楚此节点发送的消息是什么
out what is the message this node sends to the first so you're not going to

1164
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,499
到第一个，这样您就不会数不清所有的问题了
out what is the message this node sends to the first so you're not going to

1165
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:23,180
到第一个，这样您就不会数不清所有的问题了
to the first so you're not going to count the masses of questions to the no

1166
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:23,190
到第一个，这样您就不会数不清所有的问题了
count the masses of questions to the no right so here is the product of all this

1167
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:28,390
对，所以如果您愿意，这里是所有这些功能的产物
count the masses of questions to the no right so here is the product of all this

1168
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,160
对，所以如果您愿意，这里是所有这些功能的产物
right so here is the product of all this functions if you like except the ones

1169
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:31,170
对，所以如果您愿意，这里是所有这些功能的产物
functions if you like except the ones the laconic of the first electors

protectively to compute the messages from a node to a factor what do you have

1173
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,370
从一个节点到一个因子，您需要做什么，所以这是一个要知道的事，然后您想
protectively to compute the messages from a node to a factor what do you have

1174
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:44,720
从一个节点到一个因子，您需要做什么，所以这是一个要知道的事，然后您想
from a node to a factor what do you have to do so this is a know then you want to

1175
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:44,730
从一个节点到一个因子，您需要做什么，所以这是一个要知道的事，然后您想
to do so this is a know then you want to find the message for this nonsense the

1176
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,489
找到这个废话的消息，把所有的消息都拿出来
to do so this is a know then you want to find the message for this nonsense the

1177
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:49,609
找到这个废话的消息，把所有的消息都拿出来
find the message for this nonsense the factor take all the messages that all

1178
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:49,619
找到这个废话的消息，把所有的消息都拿出来
factor take all the messages that all the neighbors of this now the accept

1179
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:51,529
该邻居现在接受此事实或将其发送到此节点，并且
factor take all the messages that all the neighbors of this now the accept

1181
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:54,390
该邻居现在接受此事实或将其发送到此节点，并且
this fact or send it to it this node and then propagator so basically the masters

1182
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:57,170
然后是传播者，所以基本上大师们都说第一个是
this fact or send it to it this node and then propagator so basically the masters

1183
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,599
然后是传播者，所以基本上大师们都说第一个是
then propagator so basically the masters extreme says the first is the product of

1184
00:43:59,599 --> 00:43:59,609
然后是传播者，所以基本上大师们都说第一个是
extreme says the first is the product of this message here and that message and

1185
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:02,329
这条消息，那条消息，那条消息，当然你不会
extreme says the first is the product of this message here and that message and

1186
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:04,370
这条消息，那条消息，那条消息，当然你不会
this message here and that message and that message and of course you don't

1187
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:04,380
这条消息，那条消息，那条消息，当然你不会
that message and of course you don't account the message to the first you

1188
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,229
将消息发送到您不想发送到的第一个消息，并发送给
that message and of course you don't account the message to the first you

1189
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:08,150
将消息发送到您不想发送到的第一个消息，并发送给
account the message to the first you don't want to send to a password sent to

don't want to send to a password sent to you

1191
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,470
你有点机会，所以基本上你
don't want to send to a password sent to you

1192
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:14,760
你有点机会，所以基本上你
a little bit of chance so basically you can sit on top for the elimination

1193
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,550
可以坐在最前面的消除算法
a little bit of chance so basically you can sit on top for the elimination

无所事事地冒着风险，您知道这就是您所知道的一切，您可以轻松做到这一点
all you can know you can do this simply because these are twists so if you hand

1199
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,910
因为这些都是曲折的，所以如果您从任何地方拿到它，基本上
all you can know you can do this simply because these are twists so if you hand

1200
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,950

this point incoming message from node xn plus 1 to this factor and then you have

1415
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,220
加1到这个因子，然后您必须将xn加1积分，所以在
this point incoming message from node xn plus 1 to this factor and then you have

1416
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,710
加1到这个因子，然后您必须将xn加1积分，所以在
plus 1 to this factor and then you have to integrate now the xn plus 1 so at the

1417
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:27,720
加1到这个因子，然后您必须将xn加1积分，所以在

这与不是这样的消息是一样的
here is the same as that message is not the case

1426
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:55,440
现在等一下，如果我去说矮子，现在就和我一起在这里做吧，我看到了
here is the same as that message is not the case

00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:59,670
现在等一下，如果我去说矮子，现在就和我一起在这里做吧，我看到了
now wait a second if I go to the say shorty do it here with me now I see this

1429
00:52:59,670 --> 00:52:59,680
现在等一下，如果我去说矮子，现在就和我一起在这里做吧，我看到了
shorty do it here with me now I see this so we calculated this right as this part

1430
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,630
所以我们计算了这部分的权利，我确定我们已经计算了四次
shorty do it here with me now I see this so we calculated this right as this part

1431
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:08,340
所以我们计算了这部分的权利，我确定我们已经计算了四次
so we calculated this right as this part four times I'm sure we calculated this

1432
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:08,350
所以我们计算了这部分的权利，我确定我们已经计算了四次
four times I'm sure we calculated this message as this part of times this

1433
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:10,710
消息作为此消息的一部分，我们在没有任何xn的情况下进行集成
four times I'm sure we calculated this message as this part of times this

1434
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:14,550
消息作为此消息的一部分，我们在没有任何xn的情况下进行集成
message as this part of times this message and we integrate without any xn

1435
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:14,560
消息作为此消息的一部分，我们在没有任何xn的情况下进行集成
message and we integrate without any xn minus 1 so let's look now at this

1436
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,120
减1，现在让我们看一下来自xn的传入消息
message and we integrate without any xn minus 1 so let's look now at this

1437
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,430
减1，现在让我们看一下来自xn的传入消息
minus 1 so let's look now at this incoming message which is from no xn

1438
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:20,440
减1，现在让我们看一下来自xn的传入消息
incoming message which is from no xn minus 1 to the smartphone when you

1439
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,500
如果您认为此消息与智能手机相同，则向智能手机减去-1
incoming message which is from no xn minus 1 to the smartphone when you

1440
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,510
如果您认为此消息与智能手机相同，则向智能手机减去-1
minus 1 to the smartphone when you believe that this message is the same as

1441
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:24,520
如果您认为此消息与智能手机相同，则向智能手机减去-1
believe that this message is the same as that message because not way I'm going

1442
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:30,630
该消息，因为不是我要保存此消息的方式，这是消息
believe that this message is the same as that message because not way I'm going

1443
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,400
该消息，因为不是我要保存此消息的方式，这是消息
that message because not way I'm going to save this message this is messages

1444
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:32,410
该消息，因为不是我要保存此消息的方式，这是消息
to save this message this is messages from facto specific alright so there's

1445

1497
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,090
在这个例子中，但我只想从这个相当密集的内容开始
simply start with this rather intensive graph that is what it's supposed to do

1498
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:33,030
它应该做的图以及不同链中的帖子是什么

它应该做的图以及不同链中的帖子是什么
and what is the post in different chains is best friend to compute this expand

1501
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,290
是最好的朋友，可以通过进一步的消息传播和
and what is the post in different chains is best friend to compute this expand

是最好的朋友，可以通过进一步的消息传播和
is best friend to compute this expand with a further message propagation and a

1503
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:40,540
是最好的朋友，可以通过进一步的消息传播和
with a further message propagation and a map of message propagation and then you

1504
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,450
消息传播的地图，然后将Alpha和Beta消息相乘，然后
with a further message propagation and a map of message propagation and then you

1505
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,430
消息传播的地图，然后将Alpha和Beta消息相乘，然后
map of message propagation and then you multiply the Alpha and Beta messages and

1506
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:44,440
消息传播的地图，然后将Alpha和Beta消息相乘，然后
multiply the Alpha and Beta messages and get the effexor and similarly you can

1507
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,970
得到effexor，类似地，您可以将相应的alpha相乘
multiply the Alpha and Beta messages and get the effexor and similarly you can

node and at least note and everywhere else in the garden and ok

1513
00:55:53,740 --> 00:56:02,100
否则在花园里还可以
node and at least note and everywhere else in the garden and ok

1514
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,470
显然是在正确的地方做海星，所以如果您需要使用边界
node and at least note and everywhere else in the garden and ok

1515
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:03,480
显然是在正确的地方做海星，所以如果您需要使用边界


1516
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:08,660
显然是在正确的地方做海星，所以如果您需要使用边界
and obviously to starfish on what is right so if you need to use the boundary

1517
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:08,670
显然是在正确的地方做海星，所以如果您需要使用边界
right so if you need to use the boundary conditions that are indicated before and

1518
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:11,049
之前指出的条件，我们已经针对alpha-beta完成了此操作
right so if you need to use the boundary conditions that are indicated before and

1519
00:56:11,049 --> 00:56:13,160
之前指出的条件，我们已经针对alpha-beta完成了此操作
conditions that are indicated before and we have done this for the alpha-beta

1520
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:13,170
之前指出的条件，我们已经针对alpha-beta完成了此操作
we have done this for the alpha-beta messages so if you take if you take this

1521
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:16,880
消息，所以如果您采取的话，如果您将其视为与头部的转换关系，
we have done this for the alpha-beta messages so if you take if you take this

1522
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,829
消息，所以如果您采取的话，如果您将其视为与头部的转换关系，
messages so if you take if you take this to be casted relation to the head before

1523
00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:18,839
消息，所以如果您采取的话，如果您将其视为与头部的转换关系，
to be casted relation to the head before so if you want the message that needs no

1524
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:22,789
因此，如果您希望不需要烦恼世界的信息首先进入事实
to be casted relation to the head before so if you want the message that needs no

1525
00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:25,609
因此，如果您希望不需要烦恼世界的信息首先进入事实
so if you want the message that needs no vex world to go to the facts the first

1526
00:56:25,609 --> 00:56:25,619
因此，如果您希望不需要烦恼世界的信息首先进入事实
vex world to go to the facts the first part or basically what you need to do is

1527
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:28,339
基本上，您需要做的就是将x从潜在值整合到
vex world to go to the facts the first part or basically what you need to do is

1528
00:56:28,339 --> 00:56:32,180
基本上，您需要做的就是将x从潜在值整合到
part or basically what you need to do is integrate x one from the potential to

1529
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:32,190
基本上，您需要做的就是将x从潜在值整合到
integrate x one from the potential to Taiwan to the first two nodes in the

1530
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:34,670
台湾到消息中的前两个节点从第一个否到第一个
integrate x one from the potential to Taiwan to the first two nodes in the

1531
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:36,530
台湾到消息中的前两个节点从第一个否到第一个
Taiwan to the first two nodes in the message from the first no to the first

1532
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:36,540
台湾到消息中的前两个节点从第一个否到第一个
message from the first no to the first factor and we serve to take this equal

1533
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,410
因数，我们将其取为等于，因此您会注意到第一个消息
message from the first no to the first factor and we serve to take this equal

1534
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,870
因数，我们将其取为等于，因此您会注意到第一个消息
factor and we serve to take this equal to one so you notice the first message

1535
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:41,880
因数，我们将其取为等于，因此您会注意到第一个消息
to one so you notice the first message that comes is nothing else but

1536
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,670
那就是X中的边缘化之一
to one so you notice the first message that comes is nothing else but

1537
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:47,270
那就是X中的边缘化之一
that comes is nothing else but marginalization in X one of the

1538
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:47,280
那就是X中的边缘化之一
marginalization in X one of the potential between nodes 1 &amp; 2 you really

1539
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,950
节点1和2之间的潜力，您确实必须花一些时间做
marginalization in X one of the potential between nodes 1 &amp; 2 you really

1540
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,190
节点1和2之间的潜力，您确实必须花一些时间做
potential between nodes 1 &amp; 2 you really have to sort of spend some time doing

1541
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:55,200
节点1和2之间的潜力，您确实必须花一些时间做
have to sort of spend some time doing this turn and actually not spend some

1542
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,740
这回合实际上并没有花一些时间下一步
have to sort of spend some time doing this turn and actually not spend some

1543
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:58,520
这回合实际上并没有花一些时间下一步
this turn and actually not spend some time do next

1544
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:58,530
这回合实际上并没有花一些时间下一步
time do next programmed it okay because sort of

1545
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:02,690
可以对它进行编程，因为它看起来很像
time do next programmed it okay because sort of

1546
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:04,220
可以对它进行编程，因为它看起来很像
programmed it okay because sort of looking at it

1547
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:04,230
可以对它进行编程，因为它看起来很像
looking at it this just you know it's chained right so

1548
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:06,559
这只是您知道它正确地链接在一起，所以这是最琐碎的情况，如果我们尝试
looking at it this just you know it's chained right so

1549
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,780
这只是您知道它正确地链接在一起，所以这是最琐碎的情况，如果我们尝试
this just you know it's chained right so this is the most trivial case if we try

1550
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:08,790
这只是您知道它正确地链接在一起，所以这是最琐碎的情况，如果我们尝试
this is the most trivial case if we try to do this and we're supposed to do this

1551
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:10,880
为此，我们应该在两天或三天或两三天内完成
this is the most trivial case if we try to do this and we're supposed to do this

1552
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,380
为此，我们应该在两天或三天或两三天内完成
to do this and we're supposed to do this in two days or three days or two or

1553
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:15,390
为此，我们应该在两天或三天或两三天内完成
in two days or three days or two or three lectures on the state space model

1554
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,470
关于状态空间模型的三个讲座，所以我们收集了对状态的观察
in two days or three days or two or three lectures on the state space model

1555
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,180
关于状态空间模型的三个讲座，所以我们收集了对状态的观察
three lectures on the state space model so we collect observations of the states

1556
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:20,190
关于状态空间模型的三个讲座，所以我们收集了对状态的观察
so we collect observations of the states also you will see that things together

1557
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:23,720
你也会看到事情不是很吵，但是最重要的是
so we collect observations of the states also you will see that things together

1558
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:29,740
你也会看到事情不是很吵，但是最重要的是
also you will see that things together with not noisy okay but bottom line is

1559
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:29,750
你也会看到事情不是很吵，但是最重要的是
with not noisy okay but bottom line is if you have messages that result from

1560
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:35,380
如果您有消息是由于变量消除而导致的，并且在
with not noisy okay but bottom line is if you have messages that result from

00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,760
办公室消息是来自最快节点的消息，或者是促进过去的消息哦
the office messages are messages from fastest nodes or promotes the past oh

1565
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:43,770
办公室消息是来自最快节点的消息，或者是促进过去的消息哦
fastest nodes or promotes the past oh okay once these messages have been

1566
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:47,690
好的，这些消息完成后，您就可以评估任何内容
fastest nodes or promotes the past oh okay once these messages have been

1567
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:51,109
好的，这些消息完成后，您就可以评估任何内容
okay once these messages have been completed you can evaluate anything you

1568
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:51,119
好的，这些消息完成后，您就可以评估任何内容
completed you can evaluate anything you wish you can find marginals you can find

1569
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,170
希望你可以找到边际，你可以找到条件
completed you can evaluate anything you wish you can find marginals you can find

1570
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,280
希望你可以找到边际，你可以找到条件
wish you can find marginals you can find conditionals

1571
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:55,290
希望你可以找到边际，你可以找到条件
conditionals you can put evidence to the module joint

1572
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:58,579
您可以将证据放到模块联合分布等处等等，这样
conditionals you can put evidence to the module joint

1573
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:04,069
您可以将证据放到模块联合分布等处等等，这样
you can put evidence to the module joint distributions etc etcetera all right so

1574
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:04,079
您可以将证据放到模块联合分布等处等等，这样
distributions etc etcetera all right so let's take a break and you guys will

1575
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:05,599
让我们休息一下，你们会帮助我做一个改变，而不是改变
distributions etc etcetera all right so let's take a break and you guys will

1576
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,910
让我们休息一下，你们会帮助我做一个改变，而不是改变
let's take a break and you guys will help me to do a not a change but a

1577
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:07,920
让我们休息一下，你们会帮助我做一个改变，而不是改变
help me to do a not a change but a little bit more interesting problem

1578
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,420
多一点有趣的问题
help me to do a not a change but a little bit more interesting problem

1579
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:13,599
仍然是一个痛苦的问题，所以我们告诉了便笺，我们的第一个圆点是
help me to do a not a change but a little bit more interesting problem

1580
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:13,609
仍然是一个痛苦的问题，所以我们告诉了便笺，我们的第一个圆点是


1581
00:58:13,609 --> 00:58:21,470
仍然是一个痛苦的问题，所以我们告诉了便笺，我们的第一个圆点是
still a pain problem so we have told note and we have our first dot this

1582
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:21,480
仍然是一个痛苦的问题，所以我们告诉了便笺，我们的第一个圆点是
note and we have our first dot this partner connect nodes x1 x2 so function

1583
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,870
合作伙伴连接节点x1 x2，因此x1 x2的函数为X 2 X 3的函数，并且
note and we have our first dot this partner connect nodes x1 x2 so function

1584
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:27,140
合作伙伴连接节点x1 x2，因此x1 x2的函数为X 2 X 3的函数，并且
partner connect nodes x1 x2 so function of x1 x2 a function of X 2 X 3 and

1585
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:27,150
合作伙伴连接节点x1 x2，因此x1 x2的函数为X 2 X 3的函数，并且
of x1 x2 a function of X 2 X 3 and function of X 2 X 4 let's say let me see

1586
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:35,630
X 2 X 4的功能让我看看它的味道我的意思是
of x1 x2 a function of X 2 X 3 and function of X 2 X 4 let's say let me see

1587
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:38,390
X 2 X 4的功能让我看看它的味道我的意思是
function of X 2 X 4 let's say let me see what with it taste I mean that's suppose

1588
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:38,400
X 2 X 4的功能让我看看它的味道我的意思是
what with it taste I mean that's suppose we want to compute all the marginal

1589
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,549
我们想计算该图的所有边际分布，您知道
what with it taste I mean that's suppose we want to compute all the marginal

1590
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:44,839
我们想计算该图的所有边际分布，您知道
we want to compute all the marginal distributions of this graph and you know

1591
00:58:44,839 --> 00:58:44,849
我们想计算该图的所有边际分布，您知道
distributions of this graph and you know you evidence is not an issue you know

1592
00:58:44,849 --> 00:58:47,000
你的证据不是问题，你知道你只用其中的一部分
distributions of this graph and you know you evidence is not an issue you know

1593
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,339
你的证据不是问题，你知道你只用其中的一部分
you evidence is not an issue you know you just use slices of these

1594
00:58:49,339 --> 00:58:49,349
你的证据不是问题，你知道你只用其中的一部分
you just use slices of these distributions if you have evidence you

1595
00:58:49,349 --> 00:58:51,620
分布，如果您有知道的证据，但假设我们要查找
you just use slices of these distributions if you have evidence you

1596
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:54,349
分布，如果您有知道的证据，但假设我们要查找
distributions if you have evidence you know but let's say we want to find the

1597
00:58:54,349 --> 00:58:54,359
分布，如果您有知道的证据，但假设我们要查找
know but let's say we want to find the marginals of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 in this

1598
00:58:54,359 --> 00:58:57,620
X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4在此图中的边际，因此使用其他
know but let's say we want to find the marginals of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 in this

1599
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:02,839
X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4在此图中的边际，因此使用其他
marginals of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 in this graph so using the this some other

1600
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:02,849
X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4在此图中的边际，因此使用其他
graph so using the this some other powerful factor graphs what do we need

1601
00:59:02,849 --> 00:59:05,329
强大的因子图，我们需要开始做些什么
graph so using the this some other powerful factor graphs what do we need

1602
00:59:05,329 --> 00:59:07,910
强大的因子图，我们需要开始做些什么
powerful factor graphs what do we need to start doing

1603
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:09,290
不会是第一步，所以选择“我不知道”，然后可以是任何不是真的
powerful factor graphs what do we need to start doing

1604
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:09,300
不会是第一步，所以选择“我不知道”，然后可以是任何不是真的


1605
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:16,160
不会是第一步，所以选择“我不知道”，然后可以是任何不是真的
wouldn't be a step one so choose I don't know then can be anything doesn't really

1606
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:16,170
不会是第一步，所以选择“我不知道”，然后可以是任何不是真的
know then can be anything doesn't really matter

1607
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:16,550
没关系，所以在这种情况下，我们说
know then can be anything doesn't really matter

1608
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:20,210
没关系，所以在这种情况下，我们说
matter okay so in this case let's say we take

1609
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:20,220
没关系，所以在这种情况下，我们说
okay so in this case let's say we take the root node to be x1 all right so

1610
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,050
根节点应该是x1，所以从那里开始发送消息
okay so in this case let's say we take the root node to be x1 all right so

1611
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,910
根节点应该是x1，所以从那里开始发送消息
the root node to be x1 all right so there are start sending messages from

1612
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:25,920
根节点应该是x1，所以从那里开始发送消息
there are start sending messages from root node to the sparkler then from this

1613
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,430
根节点到烟火，然后从这张照片到这个节点，显然可以
there are start sending messages from root node to the sparkler then from this

1614
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:31,880
根节点到烟火，然后从这张照片到这个节点，显然可以
root node to the sparkler then from this photo to this node okay obviously

1615
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:31,890
根节点到烟火，然后从这张照片到这个节点，显然可以
photo to this node okay obviously descend from is known for this problem

1616
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:33,560
源于此问题，您需要知道此类源于
photo to this node okay obviously descend from is known for this problem

1617
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,910
源于此问题，您需要知道此类源于
descend from is known for this problem you need to know what this kind of from

1618
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:34,920
源于此问题，您需要知道此类源于
you need to know what this kind of from below so you're going to have to send in

1619
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,220
在下面，所以您将不得不从导出中吸取这一因素的经验教训
you need to know what this kind of from below so you're going to have to send in

1620
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,010
在下面，所以您将不得不从导出中吸取这一因素的经验教训
below so you're going to have to send in lesson from export to this factor

1621
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:39,020
在下面，所以您将不得不从导出中吸取这一因素的经验教训
lesson from export to this factor compute this message then multiply these

1622
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,780
计算此消息，然后将得到的这些消息相乘，然后进行积分
lesson from export to this factor compute this message then multiply these

1623
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:45,290
计算此消息，然后将得到的这些消息相乘，然后进行积分
compute this message then multiply these messages you get that then integrate

1624
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:45,300
计算此消息，然后将得到的这些消息相乘，然后进行积分
messages you get that then integrate this thing out through this posture and

1625
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,820
通过这种姿势摆出东西，然后您得到信息三，他们
messages you get that then integrate this thing out through this posture and

1626
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,800
通过这种姿势摆出东西，然后您得到信息三，他们
this thing out through this posture and then you get the message three and they

1627
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:48,810
通过这种姿势摆出东西，然后您得到信息三，他们
then you get the message three and they stopped going backwards

1628
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:50,740
停止向后走，所以让我们看一下
then you get the message three and they stopped going backwards

1629
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:53,450
停止向后走，所以让我们看一下
stopped going backwards alright so let's look at the

1630
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:53,460
停止向后走，所以让我们看一下
alright so let's look at the calculations one of the tally a question

1631
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:58,040
计算一个提示问题之一，一个先生是从x1到面对的消息
alright so let's look at the calculations one of the tally a question

1632
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,990
计算一个提示问题之一，一个先生是从x1到面对的消息
calculations one of the tally a question one sir is the message from x1 to face

1633
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:00,000
计算一个提示问题之一，一个先生是从x1到面对的消息
one sir is the message from x1 to face is one why is that

1634
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
是为什么
one sir is the message from x1 to face is one why is that

1635
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:11,050
我知道杂草，我们说这是现代条件，是边界
one sir is the message from x1 to face is one why is that

1636
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:11,060
我知道杂草，我们说这是现代条件，是边界


1637
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:17,200
我知道杂草，我们说这是现代条件，是边界
I know about the weed we said it's a modern condition right it's the boundary

1638
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:17,210
我知道杂草，我们说这是现代条件，是边界
modern condition right it's the boundary condition for this problem and it's

1639
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:19,600
这个问题的条件，这是因为那里没有可行的
modern condition right it's the boundary condition for this problem and it's

1640
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,400
这个问题的条件，这是因为那里没有可行的
condition for this problem and it's because there it carries the viable no

1641
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:23,410
这个问题的条件，这是因为那里没有可行的
because there it carries the viable no it's not a doctor okay and we will do

1642
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:27,040
那不是医生，我们会做一些有可能是另一个因素的事情。
because there it carries the viable no it's not a doctor okay and we will do

1643
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,390
那不是医生，我们会做一些有可能是另一个因素的事情。
it's not a doctor okay and we will do something with a factor maybe another

1644
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:28,400
那不是医生，我们会做一些有可能是另一个因素的事情。
something with a factor maybe another example so correct form to pay this mess

1645
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,170
例子，所以支付这个烂摊子的正确形式现在等于一个，让我们尝试
something with a factor maybe another example so correct form to pay this mess

1646
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,570
例子，所以支付这个烂摊子的正确形式现在等于一个，让我们尝试
example so correct form to pay this mess is equal to one now for let's try to

1647
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:34,580
例子，所以支付这个烂摊子的正确形式现在等于一个，让我们尝试
is equal to one now for let's try to extend when we have to find this we have

1648
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:38,830
扩展，当我们必须找到它时，我们必须拿护照乘以
is equal to one now for let's try to extend when we have to find this we have

1649
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:42,040
扩展，当我们必须找到它时，我们必须拿护照乘以
extend when we have to find this we have to take the passport multiplied with

1650
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:42,050
扩展，当我们必须找到它时，我们必须拿护照乘以
to take the passport multiplied with what with incoming message which is how

1651
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:45,790
传入的消息是多少，然后肯定是Flex
to take the passport multiplied with what with incoming message which is how

1652
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:49,180
传入的消息是多少，然后肯定是Flex
what with incoming message which is how much one and then definitely the Flex

1653
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:49,190
传入的消息是多少，然后肯定是Flex
much one and then definitely the Flex clock so if I wanted to add this terms

1654
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:54,580
时钟，所以如果我想添加这个明确的条款，我会说是时间
much one and then definitely the Flex clock so if I wanted to add this terms

1655
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:57,910
时钟，所以如果我想添加这个明确的条款，我会说是时间
clock so if I wanted to add this terms of explicit I would say is time the

1656
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:57,920
时钟，所以如果我想添加这个明确的条款，我会说是时间
of explicit I would say is time the summation x one right and but you get up

1657
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,770
求和x一个对，但您起床没问题，所以让我们说我们被困在这里
of explicit I would say is time the summation x one right and but you get up

1658
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:09,280
求和x一个对，但您起床没问题，所以让我们说我们被困在这里
summation x one right and but you get up okay so then let's say we are stuck here

1659
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:09,290
求和x一个对，但您起床没问题，所以让我们说我们被困在这里
okay so then let's say we are stuck here because we need to compute things from

1660
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,660
因为我们需要从下面计算东西，所以我们必须找到消息
okay so then let's say we are stuck here because we need to compute things from

1661
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,880
因为我们需要从下面计算东西，所以我们必须找到消息
because we need to compute things from below so we have to find the message for

1662
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:12,890
因为我们需要从下面计算东西，所以我们必须找到消息
below so we have to find the message for x4 to FC that's also mountain collision

1663
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:18,450
x4到FC，这也是山间碰撞好，所以该消息是该消息之一
below so we have to find the message for x4 to FC that's also mountain collision

1664
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:23,620
x4到FC，这也是山间碰撞好，所以该消息是该消息之一
x4 to FC that's also mountain collision okay so the message is one the message

1665
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:23,630
x4到FC，这也是山间碰撞好，所以该消息是该消息之一
okay so the message is one the message that they've seized has to extrude I

1666
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:25,120
他们抓住的东西必须挤出，我必须以相同的方式消除X
okay so the message is one the message that they've seized has to extrude I

1667
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,810
他们抓住的东西必须挤出，我必须以相同的方式消除X
that they've seized has to extrude I have to eliminate X for the same way we

1668
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:28,820
他们抓住的东西必须挤出，我必须以相同的方式消除X
have to eliminate X for the same way we do elimination through you get that and

1669
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,970
通过消除做得到，现在我们准备从发送信息
have to eliminate X for the same way we do elimination through you get that and

1670
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:32,620
通过消除做得到，现在我们准备从发送信息
do elimination through you get that and now we are ready to send a message from

1671
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:32,630
通过消除做得到，现在我们准备从发送信息
now we are ready to send a message from X 2 to X B so the message is basically

1672
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:35,560
X 2到XB，因此该消息基本上是Masters FASS X 2和
now we are ready to send a message from X 2 to X B so the message is basically

1673
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,500
X 2到XB，因此该消息基本上是Masters FASS X 2和
X 2 to X B so the message is basically the product of the Masters FASS X 2 and

1674
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:38,510
X 2到XB，因此该消息基本上是Masters FASS X 2和
the product of the Masters FASS X 2 and if csun's trucks - so basically the

1675
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:41,350
如果是csun的卡车-那么基本上X 2的Masters是
the product of the Masters FASS X 2 and if csun's trucks - so basically the

1676
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:45,330
如果是csun的卡车-那么基本上X 2的Masters是
if csun's trucks - so basically the Masters from X 2 to be is the product of

1677
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:45,340
如果是csun的卡车-那么基本上X 2的Masters是
Masters from X 2 to be is the product of Delta X 2 and FC books - okay and then

1678
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:51,100
Delta X 2和FC书籍-好的，然后来自FB 2 X 3的消息才是因素
Masters from X 2 to be is the product of Delta X 2 and FC books - okay and then

1679
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:55,600
Delta X 2和FC书籍-好的，然后来自FB 2 X 3的消息才是因素

1770
01:05:29,289 --> 01:05:35,380
然后定义消息，我们必须从灭绝中找到消息，让我们来看看
and then the message from FC 2 x - okay then define the message from we have to

1771
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:37,089
然后定义消息，我们必须从灭绝中找到消息，让我们来看看
then define the message from we have to find the message from extinct let's see

1772
01:05:37,089 --> 01:05:37,099
然后定义消息，我们必须从灭绝中找到消息，让我们来看看
find the message from extinct let's see also then downwards write this message

1773
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:39,699
然后再向下写这个消息在那里，那将是从
find the message from extinct let's see also then downwards write this message

1774
01:05:39,699 --> 01:05:47,219
然后再向下写这个消息在那里，那将是从
also then downwards write this message there so that would be the from again

1775
01:05:47,219 --> 01:05:47,229
然后再向下写这个消息在那里，那将是从
there so that would be the from again the missed incoming message from left be

1776
01:05:47,229 --> 01:05:49,839
来自左侧的错过的传入消息太极端了，但是来自
there so that would be the from again the missed incoming message from left be

nested okay and of course if you want to find the

1784
01:06:01,209 --> 01:06:01,219
嵌套好吧，当然，如果您想找到
and of course if you want to find the message from it's cheap to explore that

1785
01:06:01,219 --> 01:06:02,680

然后集成爆炸就好了，所以基本上，消息之间的传播
atomic mass is connected to 2 FC and then integrate explode okay so basically

1792
01:06:15,749 --> 01:06:18,489
然后集成爆炸就好了，所以基本上，消息之间的传播
then integrate explode okay so basically the propagation of the messages between

1793
01:06:18,489 --> 01:06:18,499
然后集成爆炸就好了，所以基本上，消息之间的传播
the propagation of the messages between four factors notes and those factors the

1794
01:06:18,499 --> 01:06:21,309
四个因素说明和那些因素相同，但当您基本上只是

1795
01:06:21,309 --> 01:06:26,279
四个因素说明和那些因素相同，但当您基本上只是
four factors notes and those factors the same but when you are basically just

1796
01:06:26,279 --> 01:06:26,289
四个因素说明和那些因素相同，但当您基本上只是
same but when you are basically just working with factors in eliminating

1797
01:06:26,289 --> 01:06:29,259
在消除因素方面进行原则上的工作，您必须
same but when you are basically just working with factors in eliminating

1798
01:06:29,259 --> 01:06:31,329
在消除因素方面进行原则上的工作，您必须
working with factors in eliminating factors in principle you have to

1799
01:06:31,329 --> 01:06:31,339
在消除因素方面进行原则上的工作，您必须
factors in principle you have to multiply with the fastest function okay

1800
01:06:31,339 --> 01:06:33,430
用最快的功能相乘好吧，我的意思通常是在这里，但是
factors in principle you have to multiply with the fastest function okay

1801
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:36,549
用最快的功能相乘好吧，我的意思通常是在这里，但是
multiply with the fastest function okay I mean usually very much here but the

1802
01:06:36,549 --> 01:06:36,559
用最快的功能相乘好吧，我的意思通常是在这里，但是
I mean usually very much here but the idea is you know there is a function

1803
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:40,269
想法是您知道其中涉及一个功能，而不是要成为一个功能
I mean usually very much here but the idea is you know there is a function

1804
01:06:40,269 --> 01:06:42,069
想法是您知道其中涉及一个功能，而不是要成为一个功能
idea is you know there is a function involved and not function is to be

1805
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:42,079
想法是您知道其中涉及一个功能，而不是要成为一个功能
involved and not function is to be accounted explicitly so in here we don't

1806
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,819
明确地说明，所以在这里我们实际上并没有
involved and not function is to be accounted explicitly so in here we don't

1807
01:06:45,819 --> 01:06:47,259
明确地说明，所以在这里我们实际上并没有
accounted explicitly so in here we don't have in fact also is basically the

1808
01:06:47,259 --> 01:06:47,269
明确地说明，所以在这里我们实际上并没有
have in fact also is basically the product of the messages here is the

1809
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:49,180
消息的乘积是因素，无论消息的乘积
have in fact also is basically the product of the messages here is the

1810
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:51,430
消息的乘积是因素，无论消息的乘积
product of the messages here is the factor and whatever product of messages

1811
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:51,440
消息的乘积是因素，无论消息的乘积
factor and whatever product of messages you have and then elimination so just to

1812
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:58,089
你有然后消灭，所以只是为了向你展示，但实际上这是在你
factor and whatever product of messages you have and then elimination so just to

1813
01:06:58,089 --> 01:07:01,269
你有然后消灭，所以只是为了向你展示，但实际上这是在你
you have and then elimination so just to show you but actually this during you

1814
01:07:01,269 --> 01:07:01,279
你有然后消灭，所以只是为了向你展示，但实际上这是在你
show you but actually this during you can do a lot of tests of your own right

1815
01:07:01,279 --> 01:07:04,630
可以自己进行很多测试，所以假设我们要计算
show you but actually this during you can do a lot of tests of your own right

1816
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:06,609
可以自己进行很多测试，所以假设我们要计算
can do a lot of tests of your own right so let's say we want to compute the

1817
01:07:06,609 --> 01:07:06,619
可以自己进行很多测试，所以假设我们要计算
so let's say we want to compute the marginal effects to go right so when you

1818
01:07:06,619 --> 01:07:10,719
边际效应正确，所以当您根据我们所说的内容进行扫描时，
so let's say we want to compute the marginal effects to go right so when you

1819
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,140
边际效应正确，所以当您根据我们所说的内容进行扫描时，
marginal effects to go right so when you scan based on what we said given the

1820
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:14,150
边际效应正确，所以当您根据我们所说的内容进行扫描时，
scan based on what we said given the marginal time you know this movement

1821
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:16,710
很少的时间，你知道这个动作使我不喜欢的空腔正常化
scan based on what we said given the marginal time you know this movement

1822
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:19,890
很少的时间，你知道这个动作使我不喜欢的空腔正常化
marginal time you know this movement normalized this cavity thing I don't

1823
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:19,900
很少的时间，你知道这个动作使我不喜欢的空腔正常化
normalized this cavity thing I don't know if it shows a lot of his demons

1824
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,380
知道它是否显示了他的许多恶魔不会正确地出现在PDF上，所以如果
normalized this cavity thing I don't know if it shows a lot of his demons

1825
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:24,720
知道它是否显示了他的许多恶魔不会正确地出现在PDF上，所以如果

example you can see me that we've got this equation that is product incoming

1860
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:29,010
这个方程是产品传入消息要知道的-好的
example you can see me that we've got this equation that is product incoming

01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:48,600
好吧，我不知道此示例中是否有任何新内容，所以我
all right I don't know if there's anything new on this example so I'm

1868
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:48,610
好吧，我不知道此示例中是否有任何新内容，所以我
anything new on this example so I'm going to only fit Oh actually maybe we

1869
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:52,920
只能适合哦，实际上也许我们应该在那里做这个例子
anything new on this example so I'm going to only fit Oh actually maybe we

1870
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,170
只能适合哦，实际上也许我们应该在那里做这个例子
going to only fit Oh actually maybe we should do this example there just for a

1871
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:55,180
只能适合哦，实际上也许我们应该在那里做这个例子
should do this example there just for a different so in this example the only

1872
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:58,500
不一样，所以在这个例子中，我给你的唯一的东西就是酒
should do this example there just for a different so in this example the only

1873
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,360
不一样，所以在这个例子中，我给你的唯一的东西就是酒
different so in this example the only thing that is liquor at this I give you

1874
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:00,370
不一样，所以在这个例子中，我给你的唯一的东西就是酒
thing that is liquor at this I give you evidence that x1 is different rate

1875
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:03,050
证明x1是不同速率的证据，并且，如果您注意到
thing that is liquor at this I give you evidence that x1 is different rate

1876
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:07,740
证明x1是不同速率的证据，并且，如果您注意到
evidence that x1 is different rate alright and and if you notice the

1877
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:07,750
证明x1是不同速率的证据，并且，如果您注意到
alright and and if you notice the elimination algorithm I'd like we did

1878
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:10,820
我希望我们在几乎完全相同之前所做的消除算法
alright and and if you notice the elimination algorithm I'd like we did

1879
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:15,870
我希望我们在几乎完全相同之前所做的消除算法
elimination algorithm I'd like we did before practically identical the only

1880
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:15,880
我希望我们在几乎完全相同之前所做的消除算法
before practically identical the only difference test that the you basically

1881
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:21,060
您必须基本传播信息的差异测试
before practically identical the only difference test that the you basically

1882
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:23,790
您必须基本传播信息的差异测试
difference test that the you basically have to propagate the information that

1883
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:23,800
您必须基本传播信息的差异测试
have to propagate the information that x1 is equal to a and the way to do this

1884
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:28,290
x1等于a，执行此操作的方法是从x发送一个delta函数
have to propagate the information that x1 is equal to a and the way to do this

1885
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,960
x1等于a，执行此操作的方法是从x发送一个delta函数
x1 is equal to a and the way to do this is by sending a delta function from x

1886
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:30,970
x1等于a，执行此操作的方法是从x发送一个delta函数
is by sending a delta function from x one platform and you can immediately see

1887
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:33,870
一个平台，您会立即看到这可行，因为如果您想要
is by sending a delta function from x one platform and you can immediately see

1888
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,810
一个平台，您会立即看到这可行，因为如果您想要
one platform and you can immediately see that this works because if you want the

1889
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:36,820
一个平台，您会立即看到这可行，因为如果您想要
that this works because if you want the message at one time speaks to this would

1890
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:39,630
一次说出此消息将是X 1 X 2倍的F 1的部分
that this works because if you want the message at one time speaks to this would

1891
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:42,480
一次说出此消息将是X 1 X 2倍的F 1的部分
message at one time speaks to this would be the part where F 1 of X 1 X 2 times

1892
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:42,490
一次说出此消息将是X 1 X 2倍的F 1的部分
be the part where F 1 of X 1 X 2 times the incoming message and you notice

1893
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:45,260
收到的消息，您会注意到他们将对此有所了解
be the part where F 1 of X 1 X 2 times the incoming message and you notice

1894
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,970
收到的消息，您会注意到他们将对此有所了解
the incoming message and you notice they're going to be understand this you

1895
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:47,980
收到的消息，您会注意到他们将对此有所了解
they're going to be understand this you know it basically forces x1 take the

1896
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:50,280
知道它基本上使x1取正确的值，所以这是唯一的事情
they're going to be understand this you know it basically forces x1 take the

1897
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:56,790
知道它基本上使x1取正确的值，所以这是唯一的事情
know it basically forces x1 take the value a right so this is the only thing

1898
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:56,800
知道它基本上使x1取正确的值，所以这是唯一的事情
value a right so this is the only thing you need to do to account for evidence

1899
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,500
您需要考虑证据，因此，如果您有家庭作业的问题
value a right so this is the only thing you need to do to account for evidence

1900
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,780
您需要考虑证据，因此，如果您有家庭作业的问题
you need to do to account for evidence so if you have a homework problem for

1901
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:00,790
您需要考虑证据，因此，如果您有家庭作业的问题
so if you have a homework problem for there's evidence there's nothing really

1902
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:03,390
有证据表明没有什么特别需要的，你知道的
so if you have a homework problem for there's evidence there's nothing really

1903
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:05,850
有证据表明没有什么特别需要的，你知道的
there's evidence there's nothing really particular that is needed you know this

1904
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:05,860
有证据表明没有什么特别需要的，你知道的
particular that is needed you know this already takes care of

1905
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,730
已经照顾好了
particular that is needed you know this already takes care of

1906
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:13,319
我有很多工作，非常简单，但我希望您能
particular that is needed you know this already takes care of

1907
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:13,329
我有很多工作，非常简单，但我希望您能


1908
01:10:13,329 --> 01:10:20,479
我有很多工作，非常简单，但我希望您能
I have a lot of job very simple sort of calculations but I want you to actually

1909
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:20,489
我有很多工作，非常简单，但我希望您能
calculations but I want you to actually look at this equations and be sure that

1910
01:10:20,489 --> 01:10:23,669
看一下这些方程式，并确保您清楚地了解，因为在这里您
calculations but I want you to actually look at this equations and be sure that

01:10:23,669 --> 01:10:26,399
看一下这些方程式，并确保您清楚地了解，因为在这里您
look at this equations and be sure that you clearly understand because here you

1912
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:26,409
看一下这些方程式，并确保您清楚地了解，因为在这里您
you clearly understand because here you know in summation product this of that

1913
01:10:26,409 --> 01:10:28,649
在总结产品中知道，这就像那是什么
you clearly understand because here you know in summation product this of that

1914
01:10:28,649 --> 01:10:29,910
在总结产品中知道，这就像那是什么
know in summation product this of that is like what is that

1915
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:29,920
在总结产品中知道，这就像那是什么

then you integrate all of this variables out except variable X I and this will

2068
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:35,060
变量XI除外，这将为您提供这个，并且与此类似

2085
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:12,780
有nunca左，右，没有分发，没有连接，所以因为您
distribute no connect and so because you know we have two sets of messages both

2086
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:15,890
知道我们有两组消息，它们都是从叶子到根，
distribute no connect and so because you know we have two sets of messages both

知道我们有两组消息，它们都是从叶子到根，
going from the leaves to the root and the root to the leaves but apart from

that effectively if you give a try to wrangle it to go to

2092
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:25,500
如果您尝试纠缠它去另一种算法，基本上是最小的

another algorithm is basically minimal work all right that's the algorithm and

2095
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:33,210
一切正常，这是算法，您阅读了另一个示例，然后
another algorithm is basically minimal work all right that's the algorithm and

2097
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:36,280
一切正常，这是算法，您阅读了另一个示例，然后
there's another example you read it and we take it from there but they still

2098
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:41,670
我们从那里拿走，但他们仍然口渴，即使我
there's another example you read it and we take it from there but they still
