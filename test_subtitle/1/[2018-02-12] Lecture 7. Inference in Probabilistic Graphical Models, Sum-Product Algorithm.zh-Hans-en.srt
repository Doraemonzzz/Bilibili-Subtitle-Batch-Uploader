82
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:39,940
实体系列的证据和被杀死的证据等于小T显然你要走
equal to little T obviously you're going to have to take this join distribution

83
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,080
必须采用这种ABCDE的联合发行方式，并且将BD边缘化

85
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:47,889
必须采用这种ABCDE的联合发行方式，并且将BD边缘化
of ABCDE and marginalize out BD any so you have to perform this operation of

86
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,409
您必须在这里执行此操作，如果我们假设这些
of ABCDE and marginalize out BD any so you have to perform this operation of

87
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:52,379
您必须在这里执行此操作，如果我们假设这些
you have to perform this operation of this here and if we assume that these

88
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:52,389
您必须在这里执行此操作，如果我们假设这些
this here and if we assume that these variables are all binary you will need

89
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:57,050
变量都是二进制的，您将需要B中的两个项这两个项
this here and if we assume that these variables are all binary you will need

90
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,629
变量都是二进制的，您将需要B中的两个项这两个项
variables are all binary you will need two terms from B two terms for these two

91
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
变量都是二进制的，您将需要B中的两个项这两个项
two terms from B two terms for these two terms for e so eight terms and you need

92
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,290
八个e项，您需要为每个项计算相同的项
two terms from B two terms for these two terms for e so eight terms and you need

93
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,180
八个e项，您需要为每个项计算相同的项
terms for e so eight terms and you need to compute the same terms for each of

94
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,190
八个e项，您需要为每个项计算相同的项
to compute the same terms for each of the values of a which are two so this

95
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,029
a的值是2，所以此计算是16次运算，所以这
to compute the same terms for each of the values of a which are two so this

96
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:15,180
a的值是2，所以此计算是16次运算，所以这
the values of a which are two so this calculation is 16 operation okay so this

97
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:15,190
a的值是2，所以此计算是16次运算，所以这
calculation is 16 operation okay so this is what you seal the you know the

98
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,149
是密封的东西，您知道这里的分子来计算它，您将
calculation is 16 operation okay so this is what you seal the you know the

99
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:21,750
是密封的东西，您知道这里的分子来计算它，您将
is what you seal the you know the numerator here to compute this you will

100
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:21,760
是密封的东西，您知道这里的分子来计算它，您将
numerator here to compute this you will have to do marginalization a okay so

101
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,480
必须做一个边缘化，所以这是两个操作并计算
numerator here to compute this you will have to do marginalization a okay so

102
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,149
必须做一个边缘化，所以这是两个操作并计算
have to do marginalization a okay so that's two operations and to compute

103
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:27,159
必须做一个边缘化，所以这是两个操作并计算
that's two operations and to compute this ratio you have to compute this for

104
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:29,010
您必须为每个薪水值计算该比率才能进行操作
that's two operations and to compute this ratio you have to compute this for

105
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,470
您必须为每个薪水值计算该比率才能进行操作
this ratio you have to compute this for every value of pay in order to operation

106
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:31,480
您必须为每个薪水值计算该比率才能进行操作
every value of pay in order to operation so if the calculation count is correct

107
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,630
因此，如果计算计数正确，则基本上需要执行20个操作
every value of pay in order to operation so if the calculation count is correct

108
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,550
因此，如果计算计数正确，则基本上需要执行20个操作
so if the calculation count is correct you need 20 operations basically to do

109
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:35,560
因此，如果计算计数正确，则基本上需要执行20个操作
you need 20 operations basically to do this right so the more efficient method

110
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,710
这项权利，因此我们在讨论时基于消除的更有效方法
you need 20 operations basically to do this right so the more efficient method

111
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,260
这项权利，因此我们在讨论时基于消除的更有效方法
this right so the more efficient method based on the elimination when we discuss

112
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,270
这项权利，因此我们在讨论时基于消除的更有效方法
based on the elimination when we discuss is to actually compute this by pushing

113
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,880
是通过推进一些求和来实际计算这个，所以现在如果
based on the elimination when we discuss is to actually compute this by pushing

114
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,920
是通过推进一些求和来实际计算这个，所以现在如果
is to actually compute this by pushing forward some of the summation so now if

115
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:49,930
是通过推进一些求和来实际计算这个，所以现在如果
forward some of the summation so now if you notice I put the semester only on

116
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,260
你注意到我只把这个学期放在对投资者的这种危险保留上
forward some of the summation so now if you notice I put the semester only on

117
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,860
你注意到我只把这个学期放在对投资者的这种危险保留上
you notice I put the semester only on this peril reservation on the investor

118
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:54,870
你注意到我只把这个学期放在对投资者的这种危险保留上
this peril reservation on the investor all the terms come from the factories

119
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,450
所有的术语都来自联合的工厂和魔术，因为
this peril reservation on the investor all the terms come from the factories

120
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,410
所有的术语都来自联合的工厂和魔术，因为
all the terms come from the factories ation of the joint and by magic because

121
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:01,420
所有的术语都来自联合的工厂和魔术，因为
ation of the joint and by magic because these are conditional distributions this

122
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,630
这些是条件分布，这一项等于1，这一项等于

to compute in a way that will allow us almost no additional costs to compute

246
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,100
进行计算的方式使我们几乎没有额外的计算成本
almost no additional costs to compute the marginal support of the other notes

247
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,710
其他笔记的边际支持，所以我们要这样做
almost no additional costs to compute the marginal support of the other notes

248
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,890
其他笔记的边际支持，所以我们要这样做
the marginal support of the other notes as well so we're going to do this

249
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:08,900
其他笔记的边际支持，所以我们要这样做
as well so we're going to do this calculation in a little bit more

250
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,360
计算比以前更有效
as well so we're going to do this calculation in a little bit more

251
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,750
计算比以前更有效
calculation in a little bit more efficient way than we have done before

252
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:13,760
计算比以前更有效
efficient way than we have done before so perfect I am taking the maximal

253
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,720
如此完美，我在这里采取了最大的派系-或为此法案，所以我
efficient way than we have done before so perfect I am taking the maximal

254
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,840
如此完美，我在这里采取了最大的派系-或为此法案，所以我
so perfect I am taking the maximal cliques here - or for this bill so I

255
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:20,850
如此完美，我在这里采取了最大的派系-或为此法案，所以我
cliques here - or for this bill so I write the effectors this undirected

256
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,329
写效应器，这个无向图就是节点1和
cliques here - or for this bill so I write the effectors this undirected

257
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:25,370
写效应器，这个无向图就是节点1和
write the effectors this undirected graph is the potential of the nodes 1 &amp;

写效应器，这个无向图就是节点1和
graph is the potential of the nodes 1 &amp; 2 2 &amp; 3 and minus 1 and then and and

259
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,550
2 2＆3和负1，然后和，因为这些不是概率

2 2＆3和负1，然后和，因为这些不是概率
2 2 &amp; 3 and minus 1 and then and and because these are not probabilities

261
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
2 2＆3和负1，然后和，因为这些不是概率
because these are not probabilities argue the factorization I use the an

262
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,880
争论因式分解，我使用那里的组织因数T来照顾
because these are not probabilities argue the factorization I use the an

264
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:37,710
争论因式分解，我使用那里的组织因数T来照顾
organization factor T there to take care but this product basically one of us he

265
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,090
但是这个产品基本上是我们中的一个，他给了我一个很好的价值，所以这个家伙
organization factor T there to take care but this product basically one of us he

266
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,310
但是这个产品基本上是我们中的一个，他给了我一个很好的价值，所以这个家伙
but this product basically one of us he gives me a value all right so this guy

267
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:45,320
但是这个产品基本上是我们中的一个，他给了我一个很好的价值，所以这个家伙
gives me a value all right so this guy in the question below

268
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,079
在下面的问题中，这是一种消除算法
gives me a value all right so this guy in the question below

269
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,880
在下面的问题中，这是一种消除算法
in the question below it's sort of an elimination algorithm

270
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:49,890
在下面的问题中，这是一种消除算法
it's sort of an elimination algorithm but very much different from what we

271
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,370
但与我们迄今为止所消除的情况有很大不同
it's sort of an elimination algorithm but very much different from what we

272
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:57,350
但与我们迄今为止所消除的情况有很大不同
but very much different from what we have seen up to now with the elimination

273
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
但与我们迄今为止所消除的情况有很大不同
have seen up to now with the elimination both of the resident of directed graphs

274
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,180
都是有向图的居民，所以我想让你看一下这个方程
have seen up to now with the elimination both of the resident of directed graphs

275
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,910
都是有向图的居民，所以我想让你看一下这个方程
both of the resident of directed graphs so I want you to look at this equation

276
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
都是有向图的居民，所以我想让你看一下这个方程
so I want you to look at this equation and tell me what is different you know

277
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,430
告诉我有什么不同，你知道这我在顶部有两个词，
so I want you to look at this equation and tell me what is different you know

278
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,470
告诉我有什么不同，你知道这我在顶部有两个词，
and tell me what is different you know this I have two terms one on the top and

279
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
告诉我有什么不同，你知道这我在顶部有两个词，
this I have two terms one on the top and one on the bottom

280
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,540
底部的一个好吧，我提醒您扩展
this I have two terms one on the top and one on the bottom

281
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,000
底部的一个好吧，我提醒您扩展
one on the bottom alright and I remind you the extend

282
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,010
底部的一个好吧，我提醒您扩展
alright and I remind you the extend means I have to integrate on all

283
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,400
意味着我必须在所有变量上进行整合，这是我的程度
alright and I remind you the extend means I have to integrate on all

284
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,490
意味着我必须在所有变量上进行整合，这是我的程度
means I have to integrate on all variables what extent and this is what I

285
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:16,500
意味着我必须在所有变量上进行整合，这是我的程度
variables what extent and this is what I have done here but I have done it in

286
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,560
已经在这里完成了，但是我已经按照特定的顺序完成了，所以我希望你能够
variables what extent and this is what I have done here but I have done it in

287
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,079
已经在这里完成了，但是我已经按照特定的顺序完成了，所以我希望你能够
have done here but I have done it in some specific order so I want you to

288
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:21,089
已经在这里完成了，但是我已经按照特定的顺序完成了，所以我希望你能够
some specific order so I want you to tell me what this is special there in

289
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:24,050
告诉我顺序中有什么特别之处，与有什么不同
some specific order so I want you to tell me what this is special there in

290
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,699
告诉我顺序中有什么特别之处，与有什么不同
tell me what this is special there in the order and how is that different from

291
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:25,709
告诉我顺序中有什么特别之处，与有什么不同
the order and how is that different from before so the node exchange some quality

292
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:30,110
在此之前，节点在中间的某个地方交换了一些质量，但没有
the order and how is that different from before so the node exchange some quality

293
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,360
在此之前，节点在中间的某个地方交换了一些质量，但没有
before so the node exchange some quality on the middle somewhere there it doesn't

294
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:32,370
在此之前，节点在中间的某个地方交换了一些质量，但没有
on the middle somewhere there it doesn't have to be in the middle but it's

295
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,590
必须在中间，但介于两者之间
on the middle somewhere there it doesn't have to be in the middle but it's

296
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,529
必须在中间，但介于两者之间
have to be in the middle but it's somewhere in between

297
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:38,970
所以在第一次总结中，我从右到左开始
have to be in the middle but it's somewhere in between

298
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:38,980
所以在第一次总结中，我从右到左开始


299
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:45,360
所以在第一次总结中，我从右到左开始
so on the first summation I am starting something from the right to the left

300
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,370
所以在第一次总结中，我从右到左开始
something from the right to the left from summing from x1 to x2 to xn minus 1

301
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:51,280
从x1到x2到xn减1，所以我从X传播信息
something from the right to the left from summing from x1 to x2 to xn minus 1

302
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,090
从x1到x2到xn减1，所以我从X传播信息
from summing from x1 to x2 to xn minus 1 so I am propagating information from X

303
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:55,100
从x1到x2到xn减1，所以我从X传播信息
so I am propagating information from X run all the way to excel all right and

304
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,329
一直运行以达到最佳效果，现在在底部的汇总中查看
so I am propagating information from X run all the way to excel all right and

305
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,550
一直运行以达到最佳效果，现在在底部的汇总中查看
run all the way to excel all right and look now in the summation on the bottom

306
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
一直运行以达到最佳效果，现在在底部的汇总中查看
look now in the summation on the bottom I have rearranged it in such a way that

307
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,400
我以第一个终端Excel然后在XX上的方式重新安排了它
look now in the summation on the bottom I have rearranged it in such a way that

00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,370
我以第一个终端Excel然后在XX上的方式重新安排了它
I have rearranged it in such a way that the first terminal Excel then on X X

309
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:06,380
我以第一个终端Excel然后在XX上的方式重新安排了它
the first terminal Excel then on X X capital n the next capital n minus 1 all

310
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,790
大写n下一个大写n减1一直扩展，所以我传播
the first terminal Excel then on X X capital n the next capital n minus 1 all

311
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,499
大写n下一个大写n减1一直扩展，所以我传播
capital n the next capital n minus 1 all the way to extend so I propagate

312
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:11,509
大写n下一个大写n减1一直扩展，所以我传播
the way to extend so I propagate information from X capital n to excess

313
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:15,730
X资本n到多余的信息，所以我从右边传播到
the way to extend so I propagate information from X capital n to excess

314
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,920
X资本n到多余的信息，所以我从右边传播到
information from X capital n to excess so I propagate from the right to the

315
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:17,930
X资本n到多余的信息，所以我从右边传播到
so I propagate from the right to the next step so there is a portable

316
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,290
下一步，以便将信息便携式传播到节点XN
so I propagate from the right to the next step so there is a portable

317
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,509
下一步，以便将信息便携式传播到节点XN
next step so there is a portable propagation of information to node X N

318
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:22,519
下一步，以便将信息便携式传播到节点XN
propagation of information to node X N and there is a marker propagation of

319
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,180
并且从最后一个节点X大写开始有信息的标记传播
propagation of information to node X N and there is a marker propagation of

320
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,050
并且从最后一个节点X大写开始有信息的标记传播
and there is a marker propagation of information from the last node X capital

321
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,060
并且从最后一个节点X大写开始有信息的标记传播
information from the last node X capital of time ok so this is not similar to

322
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,800
时间还可以，所以这与我们消除淘汰的方式不同
information from the last node X capital of time ok so this is not similar to

323
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,269
时间还可以，所以这与我们消除淘汰的方式不同
of time ok so this is not similar to what we did with the elimination

324
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:34,279
时间还可以，所以这与我们消除淘汰的方式不同
what we did with the elimination algorithm right where we start

325
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,680
正确的算法，我们从这里开始以某些顺序消除

00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:00,750
好的算法，所以我们将为隐藏执行此操作
algorithm which is that you tell the algorithm

850
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:06,060
好的算法，所以我们将为隐藏执行此操作
algorithm ok and so we will do this for hidden

851
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,070
好的算法，所以我们将为隐藏执行此操作
ok and so we will do this for hidden markov models will spend one lecture

852
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,160
马可夫模型将在一场演讲中使用权利，但我希望您能以某种方式看到它
ok and so we will do this for hidden markov models will spend one lecture

853
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,640
马可夫模型将在一场演讲中使用权利，但我希望您能以某种方式看到它
markov models will spend one lecture right but I want you to see that somehow

854
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:11,650
马可夫模型将在一场演讲中使用权利，但我希望您能以某种方式看到它
right but I want you to see that somehow destination can be replaced with

855
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,220
目的地可以替换为最大化算法
right but I want you to see that somehow destination can be replaced with

856
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,810
目的地可以替换为最大化算法
destination can be replaced with maximization the algorithm is sort of

857
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:17,820
目的地可以替换为最大化算法
maximization the algorithm is sort of the same but there is some details that

858
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,120
一样，但有一些细节，它们是独特的曲折
maximization the algorithm is sort of the same but there is some details that

859
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,270
一样，但有一些细节，它们是独特的曲折
the same but there is some details that they are unique twists

860
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:22,280
一样，但有一些细节，它们是独特的曲折
they are unique twists Bianca and they are unique because you

861
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,340
比安卡（Bianca）和它们很独特，因为您知道水分过多
they are unique twists Bianca and they are unique because you

862
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,590
比安卡（Bianca）和它们很独特，因为您知道水分过多
Bianca and they are unique because you know you have too much moisture the

863
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:29,600
比安卡（Bianca）和它们很独特，因为您知道水分过多
know you have too much moisture the joint not the mass goes all right and

864
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,380
联合不是群众顺利，而你这样做的方式介绍了一些
know you have too much moisture the joint not the mass goes all right and

865
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,540
联合不是群众顺利，而你这样做的方式介绍了一些
joint not the mass goes all right and the way you do this introduce some

866
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:34,550
联合不是群众顺利，而你这样做的方式介绍了一些
the way you do this introduce some little treat the someone needs to

867
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,700
有人需要在一天结束时考虑一点点的治疗，所以他的
the way you do this introduce some little treat the someone needs to

868
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,670
有人需要在一天结束时考虑一点点的治疗，所以他的
little treat the someone needs to consider at the end of the day so his

869
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:39,680
有人需要在一天结束时考虑一点点的治疗，所以他的
consider at the end of the day so his tongue were even worse under much

870
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,320
在很多产品而不是我们将要使用的某些产品下，舌头甚至更糟
consider at the end of the day so his tongue were even worse under much

871
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,990
在很多产品而不是我们将要使用的某些产品下，舌头甚至更糟
tongue were even worse under much product rather than some product we will

872
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,000
在很多产品而不是我们将要使用的某些产品下，舌头甚至更糟
product rather than some product we will revisit okay

873
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,070
重新访问还可以
product rather than some product we will revisit okay

874
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,980
所以我们刚才讨论的求和算法可以
product rather than some product we will revisit okay

875
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:48,990
所以我们刚才讨论的求和算法可以


876
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:56,480
所以我们刚才讨论的求和算法可以
so the sum-product algorithm that we just discussed for change you can

877
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:56,490
所以我们刚才讨论的求和算法可以
just discussed for change you can compute a whole homogenous for trees all

878
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,600
计算出树木的整体同质性，我将再次向您展示
just discussed for change you can compute a whole homogenous for trees all

879
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,690
计算出树木的整体同质性，我将再次向您展示
compute a whole homogenous for trees all right and I'm gonna show you again

880
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:02,700
计算出树木的整体同质性，我将再次向您展示
right and I'm gonna show you again pictures all right

881
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,649
图片可以正确显示我们的无向图，所以它们都是
right and I'm gonna show you again pictures all right

882
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:08,990
图片可以正确显示我们的无向图，所以它们都是
pictures all right our undirected graph and so they are all

883
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,000
图片可以正确显示我们的无向图，所以它们都是
our undirected graph and so they are all directed graphs leading to twist vision

884
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,019
有向图导致扭曲视觉，当我们与
our undirected graph and so they are all directed graphs leading to twist vision

885
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:17,299
有向图导致扭曲视觉，当我们与
directed graphs leading to twist vision you know you never when we worked with

886
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:17,309
有向图导致扭曲视觉，当我们与
you know you never when we worked with directed graphs we have some you know

887
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:19,789
有向图，即使在消除算法中，我们也有一些您知道的
you know you never when we worked with directed graphs we have some you know

888
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:21,470
有向图，即使在消除算法中，我们也有一些您知道的
directed graphs we have some you know even in the elimination algorithm to

889
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:21,480
有向图，即使在消除算法中，我们也有一些您知道的
even in the elimination algorithm to make them undirected so when you we make

890
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,039
使它们无方向性，所以当您直接使它们闭合时，我们总是得到三个
even in the elimination algorithm to make them undirected so when you we make

891
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,690
使它们无方向性，所以当您直接使它们闭合时，我们总是得到三个
make them undirected so when you we make them on directly do we always get three

892
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:26,700
使它们无方向性，所以当您直接使它们闭合时，我们总是得到三个
them on directly do we always get three so what do we need to get a tree in

893
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,029
所以我们需要什么来指导工作
them on directly do we always get three so what do we need to get a tree in

894
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:32,090
所以我们需要什么来指导工作
so what do we need to get a tree in directing job

895
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:37,510
如果宣布，这与生活中的道德事件有关
so what do we need to get a tree in directing job

896
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:37,520
如果宣布，这与生活中的道德事件有关


897
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:46,779
如果宣布，这与生活中的道德事件有关
it's something to do with the moral events in life if announce that to

898
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:46,789
如果宣布，这与生活中的道德事件有关
events in life if announce that to parents and we transform this sort of

899
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:49,269
父母，我们直接转换这种图来说明发生了什么事
events in life if announce that to parents and we transform this sort of

900
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:55,419
父母，我们直接转换这种图来说明发生了什么事
parents and we transform this sort of directly graph what was happening we

901
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:55,429
父母，我们直接转换这种图来说明发生了什么事
directly graph what was happening we will get what temp and no one with two

902
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:58,539
会得到什么样的温度，没有人拥有两种力量使变革变得光明
directly graph what was happening we will get what temp and no one with two

903
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:00,880
会得到什么样的温度，没有人拥有两种力量使变革变得光明
will get what temp and no one with two powers brightening transformational

904
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:00,890
会得到什么样的温度，没有人拥有两种力量使变革变得光明
powers brightening transformational directive what do you get

905
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,059
指令你得到什么
powers brightening transformational directive what do you get

906
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:07,020
如果您使他们摆脱了道德化的影响，那么您会发现它不是
powers brightening transformational directive what do you get

907
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,030
如果您使他们摆脱了道德化的影响，那么您会发现它不是


908
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:11,100
如果您使他们摆脱了道德化的影响，那么您会发现它不是
if you get them out of the moralization effect you get a look so it's not a

909
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,110
如果您使他们摆脱了道德化的影响，那么您会发现它不是
effect you get a look so it's not a three anymore alright but if the if

910
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:17,010
三个都可以了，但是如果有向图中的所有知识
effect you get a look so it's not a three anymore alright but if the if

911
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,299
三个都可以了，但是如果有向图中的所有知识
three anymore alright but if the if every knowledge in the directed graph

912
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:18,309
三个都可以了，但是如果有向图中的所有知识
every knowledge in the directed graph just one pallet then we do actually get

913
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:21,870
只是一个货盘，那么如果确实有一个货盘，我们现在确实可以得到三个货盘了
every knowledge in the directed graph just one pallet then we do actually get

914
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:28,409
只是一个货盘，那么如果确实有一个货盘，我们现在确实可以得到三个货盘了
just one pallet then we do actually get the three okay now if in the case of a

915
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:28,419
只是一个货盘，那么如果确实有一个货盘，我们现在确实可以得到三个货盘了
the three okay now if in the case of a directed graph that a node would say has

916
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:31,710
一个节点会说有两个父母要结婚的有向图，你会得到一个
the three okay now if in the case of a directed graph that a node would say has

917
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,100
一个节点会说有两个父母要结婚的有向图，你会得到一个
directed graph that a node would say has two parents that you marry and you get a

918
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,110
一个节点会说有两个父母要结婚的有向图，你会得到一个
two parents that you marry and you get a loop right you can actually transform

919
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,850
向右循环，您实际上可以将引导爱指向所谓的点
two parents that you marry and you get a loop right you can actually transform

920
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,279
向右循环，您实际上可以将引导爱指向所谓的点
loop right you can actually transform dot on directing love to what is called

921
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:41,289
向右循环，您实际上可以将引导爱指向所谓的点
dot on directing love to what is called a poly-tree

922
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:42,380
一棵多树，它是由
dot on directing love to what is called a poly-tree

923
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,409
一棵多树，它是由
a poly-tree and it comes out using the sponsor of

924
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:46,419
一棵多树，它是由
and it comes out using the sponsor of the fact of graphs that are left behind

925
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:48,090
我以前的演讲中遗留下来的图表事实，如果您
and it comes out using the sponsor of the fact of graphs that are left behind

926
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,180
我以前的演讲中遗留下来的图表事实，如果您
the fact of graphs that are left behind from my previous lecture you can if you

927
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,190
我以前的演讲中遗留下来的图表事实，如果您
from my previous lecture you can if you transform than the undirected graph to

928
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,770
比无向图转换成所谓的因子图，然后我们做
from my previous lecture you can if you transform than the undirected graph to

929
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,840
比无向图转换成所谓的因子图，然后我们做
transform than the undirected graph to what is called a factor graph then we do

930
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:54,850
比无向图转换成所谓的因子图，然后我们做
what is called a factor graph then we do get at three my point here is that the

931
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:58,950
我的观点在这里是三点，即该算法可以处理所有
what is called a factor graph then we do get at three my point here is that the

932
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,230
我的观点在这里是三点，即该算法可以处理所有
get at three my point here is that the sample that algorithm can handle all of

933
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:01,240
我的观点在这里是三点，即该算法可以处理所有
sample that algorithm can handle all of these things with the same complexity

934
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,899
这些具有相同复杂性的东西都可以，所以我们学习如何做
sample that algorithm can handle all of these things with the same complexity

935
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:07,649
这些具有相同复杂性的东西都可以，所以我们学习如何做
these things with the same complexity all right so we learning on how to do

936
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:07,659
这些具有相同复杂性的东西都可以，所以我们学习如何做
all right so we learning on how to do inference message-passing with trish is

937
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,990
使用trish进行推理消息传递非常重要，因为它适用于
all right so we learning on how to do inference message-passing with trish is

938
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,119
使用trish进行推理消息传递非常重要，因为它适用于
inference message-passing with trish is very important because it's applied to

939
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:12,129
使用trish进行推理消息传递非常重要，因为它适用于
very important because it's applied to both directed and undirected graphs and

940
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:14,339
包括有向图和无向图，我们正在讨论这些事情
very important because it's applied to both directed and undirected graphs and

942
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:15,609
包括有向图和无向图，我们正在讨论这些事情
we are serving the things to discuss today with pictures okay so this is this

943
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:20,250
今天有图片还可以，所以这是一个无方向性的三个都可以。
we are serving the things to discuss today with pictures okay so this is this

944
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:26,070
今天有图片还可以，所以这是一个无方向性的三个都可以。
today with pictures okay so this is this is an undirected three okay here every

945
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:26,080
今天有图片还可以，所以这是一个无方向性的三个都可以。
is an undirected three okay here every node has one part so you know this is

946
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,869
节点只有一部分，所以您知道这是直接输入的内容，如果有
is an undirected three okay here every node has one part so you know this is

节点只有一部分，所以您知道这是直接输入的内容，如果有
node has one part so you know this is this to the direct entry and if there's

948
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:31,179
节点只有一部分，所以您知道这是直接输入的内容，如果有
this to the direct entry and if there's no modernization so it needs to

949
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,970
没有现代化，所以它需要类似的东西
this to the direct entry and if there's no modernization so it needs to

950
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,980
没有现代化，所以它需要类似的东西
no modernization so it needs to something like that okay

951
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:34,990
没有现代化，所以它需要类似的东西
something like that okay the only thing that i emphasized here in

952
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,250
我在这里用蓝色强调的唯一的事情就是你在导演中知道的
something like that okay the only thing that i emphasized here in

953
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,770
我在这里用蓝色强调的唯一的事情就是你在导演中知道的
the only thing that i emphasized here in blue is here you know in the directed

954
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:40,780
我在这里用蓝色强调的唯一的事情就是你在导演中知道的
blue is here you know in the directed love to work with conditional

955
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,089
如果我们开始潜能，我喜欢与条件分布一起工作
blue is here you know in the directed love to work with conditional

956
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:45,060
如果我们开始潜能，我喜欢与条件分布一起工作
love to work with conditional distributions if we start the potentials

957
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,070
如果我们开始潜能，我喜欢与条件分布一起工作
distributions if we start the potentials their conditional distributions of not

958
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,060
他们没有给出其父级的条件分布和这些分布
distributions if we start the potentials their conditional distributions of not

959
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,790
他们没有给出其父级的条件分布和这些分布
their conditional distributions of not given its parent and these distributions

960
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:50,800
他们没有给出其父级的条件分布和这些分布
given its parent and these distributions are normalized but when you work in

961
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,849
归一化，但是当您在无定向的情况下工作时
given its parent and these distributions are normalized but when you work in

962
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:54,060
归一化，但是当您在无定向的情况下工作时
are normalized but when you work in undirected

963
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,070
归一化，但是当您在无定向的情况下工作时
undirected twist all right the there is a

964
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:59,070
好吧，通常会有一个归一化的因子，所以
undirected twist all right the there is a

965
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,010
好吧，通常会有一个归一化的因子，所以
twist all right the there is a normalization factor in general okay so

966
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:02,020
好吧，通常会有一个归一化的因子，所以
normalization factor in general okay so in general is a normalization factor

967
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,740
通常，即使在这种情况下，也是一个归一化因子
normalization factor in general okay so in general is a normalization factor

968
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,359
通常，即使在这种情况下，也是一个归一化因子
in general is a normalization factor even in this case if you have some

969
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:06,369
通常，即使在这种情况下，也是一个归一化因子
even in this case if you have some evidence and you can solve this sort of

970
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:08,820
证据，您可以在那里解决这种定向树
even in this case if you have some evidence and you can solve this sort of

971
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,840
证据，您可以在那里解决这种定向树
evidence and you can solve this sort of directed tree there

972
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:11,850
证据，您可以在那里解决这种定向树
directed tree there very speed of normalization factor the

973
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,550
归一化因子的速度非常快我们基本上有证据的因子
directed tree there very speed of normalization factor the

974
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,860
归一化因子的速度非常快我们基本上有证据的因子
very speed of normalization factor the factor we have an evidence basically

975
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:15,870
归一化因子的速度非常快我们基本上有证据的因子
factor we have an evidence basically introduced normalization factor so

976
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:20,090
引入归一化因子
factor we have an evidence basically introduced normalization factor so

977
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,640
好吧，这就是43的情况，所以这个家伙有两名飞行员，所以如果你
factor we have an evidence basically introduced normalization factor so

978
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:21,650
好吧，这就是43的情况，所以这个家伙有两名飞行员，所以如果你


979
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:29,290
好吧，这就是43的情况，所以这个家伙有两名飞行员，所以如果你
alright then here is the case of the 43 so this guy has two pilots so if you

980
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:29,300
好吧，这就是43的情况，所以这个家伙有两名飞行员，所以如果你
so this guy has two pilots so if you marry them if you connect them together

981
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,430
如果将它们连接在一起，则将它们嫁给您，就可以创建一个循环，所以这就是
so this guy has two pilots so if you marry them if you connect them together

982
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,260
如果将它们连接在一起，则将它们嫁给您，就可以创建一个循环，所以这就是
marry them if you connect them together you create a loop right so this is the

983
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:33,270
如果将它们连接在一起，则将它们嫁给您，就可以创建一个循环，所以这就是
you create a loop right so this is the 43 so we will learn I think on the

984
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,230
43所以我们会在明天的讲座上学习我的想法，所以我不会忘记我们
you create a loop right so this is the 43 so we will learn I think on the

985
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,480
43所以我们会在明天的讲座上学习我的想法，所以我不会忘记我们
43 so we will learn I think on the lecture tomorrow so I don't forget we're

986
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:38,490
43所以我们会在明天的讲座上学习我的想法，所以我不会忘记我们
lecture tomorrow so I don't forget we're going to have election tomorrow we're

987
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,580
明天将要举行选举我们今天将扩展想法，以了解
lecture tomorrow so I don't forget we're going to have election tomorrow we're

988
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,100
明天将要举行选举我们今天将扩展想法，以了解
going to have election tomorrow we're going to extend the ideas today to see

989
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,110
明天将要举行选举我们今天将扩展想法，以了解
going to extend the ideas today to see how we're going to do influenced only 43

990
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,830
我们怎么做只会影响使用照片的43个人，所以我们要
going to extend the ideas today to see how we're going to do influenced only 43

991
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:51,650
我们怎么做只会影响使用照片的43个人，所以我们要
how we're going to do influenced only 43 using photographs okay so we're going to

992
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:51,660
我们怎么做只会影响使用照片的43个人，所以我们要
using photographs okay so we're going to talk about these misters passing two

993
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,680
谈论这些先生通过两棵非常普通的树好吧，我要
using photographs okay so we're going to talk about these misters passing two

994
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,380
谈论这些先生通过两棵非常普通的树好吧，我要
talk about these misters passing two very general trees okay and I'm going to

995
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:57,390
谈论这些先生通过两棵非常普通的树好吧，我要
very general trees okay and I'm going to work with what directed and undirected

996
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,150
使用有向图和无向图，因此我需要提醒您一些
very general trees okay and I'm going to work with what directed and undirected

997
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,630
使用有向图和无向图，因此我需要提醒您一些
work with what directed and undirected graphs so I need to remind you some of

998
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:02,640
使用有向图和无向图，因此我需要提醒您一些
graphs so I need to remind you some of the notation so let's the work for

999
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,720
记号，所以让我们进行无向风险的工作，以及我在这里所拥有的

if this was the direct entry things are a little bit easier because

1038
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,970
事情要容易一些，因为在直接输入中，您要做的是
if this was the direct entry things are a little bit easier because

1054
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,750
轻松地使它与您知道的方式相对应
and easily you can make this to correspond to that how is that you know

1055
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:51,760
轻松地使它与您知道的方式相对应
correspond to that how is that you know you can say at the node are make this

1056
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,839
您可以在节点上说，让此潜在的皮划艇为X的P感到抱歉
correspond to that how is that you know you can say at the node are make this

00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,630
您可以在节点上说，让此潜在的皮划艇为X的P感到抱歉
you can say at the node are make this potential kayak sorry for the P of X

1058
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:57,640
您可以在节点上说，让此潜在的皮划艇为X的P感到抱歉
potential kayak sorry for the P of X star and make all the other potential

1059
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,790
恒星并使所有其他势均等于一个好，所以基本上
potential kayak sorry for the P of X star and make all the other potential

1060
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:04,380
恒星并使所有其他势均等于一个好，所以基本上
star and make all the other potential equal to one okay so so basically this

1061
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:04,390
恒星并使所有其他势均等于一个好，所以基本上
equal to one okay so so basically this is a very general expression for both

1062
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,050
是针对有向和无向富人的非常笼统的表达方式
equal to one okay so so basically this is a very general expression for both

1063
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:11,490
是针对有向和无向富人的非常笼统的表达方式
is a very general expression for both directed and undirected rich

1064
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,630
证明我们基本上可以做的另一件事，就是说
is a very general expression for both directed and undirected rich

1065
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:13,640
证明我们基本上可以做的另一件事，就是说


1066
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:19,630
证明我们基本上可以做的另一件事，就是说
evidence we basically the other thing you have to do if let's say the value of

1067
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:19,640
证明我们基本上可以做的另一件事，就是说
you have to do if let's say the value of x is fixed at X I bar you need to change

1068
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,170
x固定在XI柱上，您需要更改阶跃电位的定义
you have to do if let's say the value of x is fixed at X I bar you need to change

1069
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,180
x固定在XI柱上，您需要更改阶跃电位的定义
x is fixed at X I bar you need to change the definition of the step potentials

1070
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:25,190
x固定在XI柱上，您需要更改阶跃电位的定义
the definition of the step potentials and so the note is not evidence now this

1071
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:30,400
因此，该注释现在无法证明这一潜力就是您从
the definition of the step potentials and so the note is not evidence now this

1072
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,980
因此，该注释现在无法证明这一潜力就是您从
and so the note is not evidence now this potential is what you started with in

1073
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:32,990
因此，该注释现在无法证明这一潜力就是您从
potential is what you started with in evidence no if you just have to plug in

1074
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,319
没有证据表明，如果您只需要插入基本上说
potential is what you started with in evidence no if you just have to plug in

1075
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:37,120
没有证据表明，如果您只需要插入基本上说
evidence no if you just have to plug in this Delta function that basically says

1076
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,130
没有证据表明，如果您只需要插入基本上说
this Delta function that basically says the value of this X I you will get a

1077
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:41,050
XI的值，您将获得一个非零贡献，其中X等于
this Delta function that basically says the value of this X I you will get a

1078
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,059
XI的值，您将获得一个非零贡献，其中X等于
the value of this X I you will get a nonzero contribution where X is equal to

1079
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:43,069
XI的值，您将获得一个非零贡献，其中X等于
nonzero contribution where X is equal to X I bar so if you have evidence the

1080
00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:48,069
XI条，因此，如果您有证据证明以前的方程式是
nonzero contribution where X is equal to X I bar so if you have evidence the

1081
00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:49,900
XI条，因此，如果您有证据证明以前的方程式是
X I bar so if you have evidence the previous equation that they had this is

1082
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:49,910
XI条，因此，如果您有证据证明以前的方程式是
previous equation that they had this is you know the joint now if I want to

1083
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,020
如果我想写给定的x的概率，你现在知道关节
previous equation that they had this is you know the joint now if I want to

1084
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,589
如果我想写给定的x的概率，你现在知道关节
you know the joint now if I want to write the probability of x given the

1085
00:38:56,589 --> 00:38:56,599
如果我想写给定的x的概率，你现在知道关节
write the probability of x given the evidence the expression is the same this

1086
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:00,460
证明表达是相同的，这是每个节点的自电位
write the probability of x given the evidence the expression is the same this

1087
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,660
证明表达是相同的，这是每个节点的自电位
evidence the expression is the same this are the self potentials for each node

1088
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:04,670
证明表达是相同的，这是每个节点的自电位
are the self potentials for each node but there are the evidence potentials

1089
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,730
但是有证据表明这种潜力成倍增长，但是什么是
are the self potentials for each node but there are the evidence potentials

1090
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,950
但是有证据表明这种潜力成倍增长，但是什么是
but there are the evidence potentials this multiplied potential but what is

1091
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:08,960
但是有证据表明这种潜力成倍增长，但是什么是
this multiplied potential but what is important note is when you have evidence

1092
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,930
重要说明是，当您有证据证明现在的归一化因子可能不是
this multiplied potential but what is important note is when you have evidence

unspecified are not part of the evidence will disappear will be cleaned out so

1187
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:13,020

unspecified are not part of the evidence will disappear will be cleaned out so

1188
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,420
将消失，将被清除，所以我们唯一需要考虑的是

1189
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:15,430
将消失，将被清除，所以我们唯一需要考虑的是
the only thing we need to consider is when we know the leaves are what what I

1190
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:18,809
当我们知道叶子是什么我还不明显好吗，所以我们只需要
the only thing we need to consider is when we know the leaves are what what I

1191
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:26,339
当我们知道叶子是什么我还不明显好吗，所以我们只需要
when we know the leaves are what what I was not evident okay so we only have to

1192
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:26,349
当我们知道叶子是什么我还不明显好吗，所以我们只需要
was not evident okay so we only have to consider the case where the the lists

1193
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:30,089
考虑在这种情况下列表基本上是可以的情况
was not evident okay so we only have to consider the case where the the lists

1194
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,640
考虑在这种情况下列表基本上是可以的情况
consider the case where the the lists are basically evidence okay in that case

1195
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:32,650
考虑在这种情况下列表基本上是可以的情况
are basically evidence okay in that case remember that normalizations g that we

1196
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,099
请记住，我们认为它不希望等于的归一化g
are basically evidence okay in that case remember that normalizations g that we

1197
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:36,990
请记住，我们认为它不希望等于的归一化g
remember that normalizations g that we consider it don't want to be equal to

1198
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:37,000
请记住，我们认为它不希望等于的归一化g
consider it don't want to be equal to one so we can prove any subtree that

1199
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,890
这样一来，我们就可以证明任何子树，争用开发者不是
consider it don't want to be equal to one so we can prove any subtree that

1200
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,510
这样一来，我们就可以证明任何子树，争用开发者不是
one so we can prove any subtree that contention developers that are not

1201
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:42,520
这样一来，我们就可以证明任何子树，争用开发者不是
contention developers that are not conditioned on by eliminating backwards

1202
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,059
以消除向后的情况为条件，所以现在让我们看看会发生什么
contention developers that are not conditioned on by eliminating backwards

1203
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:50,819
以消除向后的情况为条件，所以现在让我们看看会发生什么
conditioned on by eliminating backwards okay so so let's see now what happens

1204
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:50,829
以消除向后的情况为条件，所以现在让我们看看会发生什么
okay so so let's see now what happens okay

1205
00:42:50,829 --> 00:42:53,250
好吧，在这种情况下，我声称如果
okay so so let's see now what happens okay

1206
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:58,559
好吧，在这种情况下，我声称如果
okay in a case like this I am claiming if

1207
00:42:58,559 --> 00:42:58,569
好吧，在这种情况下，我声称如果
in a case like this I am claiming if this is my evidence node but somehow

1208
00:42:58,569 --> 00:43:00,930
这是我的证据节点，但是以某种方式追溯到我可以证明他们，我可以
in a case like this I am claiming if this is my evidence node but somehow

1209
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:03,599
这是我的证据节点，但是以某种方式追溯到我可以证明他们，我可以
this is my evidence node but somehow this traced I can prove them and I can

1210
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:03,609
这是我的证据节点，但是以某种方式追溯到我可以证明他们，我可以
this traced I can prove them and I can do inference on incident support Li so I

1211
00:43:03,609 --> 00:43:06,300
对事件支持李进行推断，所以我想让你告诉我为什么它不是
this traced I can prove them and I can do inference on incident support Li so I

1212
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,710
对事件支持李进行推断，所以我想让你告诉我为什么它不是
do inference on incident support Li so I want you to tell me why it's not the

1213
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:07,720
对事件支持李进行推断，所以我想让你告诉我为什么它不是
want you to tell me why it's not the case

00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,930
案件
want you to tell me why it's not the case

1215
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,630
您不必阅读那里的内容，因为我没有时间
want you to tell me why it's not the case

1216
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:12,640
您不必阅读那里的内容，因为我没有时间


1217
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,959
您不必阅读那里的内容，因为我没有时间
you don't have to read what it says there because I don't have time for

1218
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:15,969
您不必阅读那里的内容，因为我没有时间
there because I don't have time for reading right so just this is my only

1219
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:19,259
阅读正确，所以这只是我唯一的证据，在这里我并不是在暗示
there because I don't have time for reading right so just this is my only

1220
00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:23,370
阅读正确，所以这只是我唯一的证据，在这里我并不是在暗示
reading right so just this is my only evidence right here I'm not implying

1221
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:23,380
阅读正确，所以这只是我唯一的证据，在这里我并不是在暗示
evidence right here I'm not implying that you're not going to account for the

1222
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:27,329
说您不会考虑这些变化，那么说一下潜力，因为
evidence right here I'm not implying that you're not going to account for the

1223
00:43:27,329 --> 00:43:29,999
说您不会考虑这些变化，那么说一下潜力，因为
that you're not going to account for the changes let's say the potentials because

1224
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:30,009
说您不会考虑这些变化，那么说一下潜力，因为
changes let's say the potentials because of the evidence but why I can actually

1225
00:43:30,009 --> 00:43:34,459
的证据，但为什么我实际上可以将其分为三个可追溯的工作
changes let's say the potentials because of the evidence but why I can actually

1226
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:37,410
的证据，但为什么我实际上可以将其分为三个可追溯的工作
of the evidence but why I can actually separate this to three traced work in

1227
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:37,420
的证据，但为什么我实际上可以将其分为三个可追溯的工作
separate this to three traced work in doing front separately what is they are

1228
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,989
分别做前面，这是什么基本图，该图使我能够
separate this to three traced work in doing front separately what is they are

1229
00:43:39,989 --> 00:43:41,880
分别做前面，这是什么基本图，该图使我能够
doing front separately what is they are fundamental this graph that allows me to

1230
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:41,890
分别做前面，这是什么基本图，该图使我能够
fundamental this graph that allows me to do that

1231
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,279
去做
fundamental this graph that allows me to do that

1232
00:43:44,279 --> 00:43:48,190
例如，在这里有这些明显的证据，您能告诉我什么
fundamental this graph that allows me to do that

1233
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:48,200
例如，在这里有这些明显的证据，您能告诉我什么


1234
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:54,030
例如，在这里有这些明显的证据，您能告诉我什么
for example with this evident evidence here what can you tell me on the

1235
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:54,040
例如，在这里有这些明显的证据，您能告诉我什么
here what can you tell me on the probability of this note conditioned on

1236
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:59,230
此便笺的概率取决于列表
here what can you tell me on the probability of this note conditioned on

1237
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,339
此便笺的概率取决于列表
probability of this note conditioned on on the list

1238
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:00,349
此便笺的概率取决于列表
on the list I mean conditioned on the app noticed

1239
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:02,440
我的意思是说，以应用程序为条件的情况下，您能告诉我有关关节的哪些信息
on the list I mean conditioned on the app noticed

1240
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,059
我的意思是说，以应用程序为条件的情况下，您能告诉我有关关节的哪些信息
I mean conditioned on the app noticed what can you tell me about the joint

1241
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:04,069
我的意思是说，以应用程序为条件的情况下，您能告诉我有关关节的哪些信息
what can you tell me about the joint probability let's say of this and this

1242
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:06,039
让我们说这和它们独立的条件的概率
what can you tell me about the joint probability let's say of this and this

1243
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:10,650
让我们说这和它们独立的条件的概率
probability let's say of this and this condition of that they are independent

1244
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:10,660
让我们说这和它们独立的条件的概率
condition of that they are independent okay so effectively the only thing we

1245
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:17,530
好吧，如此有效，我们真正需要考虑的唯一事情就是
condition of that they are independent okay so effectively the only thing we

1246
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,839
好吧，如此有效，我们真正需要考虑的唯一事情就是
okay so effectively the only thing we really have to consider is anything that

1247
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:19,849
好吧，如此有效，我们真正需要考虑的唯一事情就是
really have to consider is anything that we have observed right you prune it away

1248
00:44:19,849 --> 00:44:21,700
我们观察到您将其修剪掉了，唯一的注意是
really have to consider is anything that we have observed right you prune it away

1249
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,849
我们观察到您将其修剪掉了，唯一的注意是
we have observed right you prune it away all right and the only notes that you're

1250
00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:24,859
我们观察到您将其修剪掉了，唯一的注意是
all right and the only notes that you're going to have to believe we have to be

1251
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:26,650
将不得不相信我们必须是证据叶和其他一切
all right and the only notes that you're going to have to believe we have to be

1252
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,510
将不得不相信我们必须是证据叶和其他一切
going to have to believe we have to be evidence leaves and everything else

1253
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:28,520
将不得不相信我们必须是证据叶和其他一切
evidence leaves and everything else basically has to be on themselves that

1254
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,799
基本上必须要对自己感兴趣，这样才能很好地进行推理
evidence leaves and everything else basically has to be on themselves that

1255
00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:32,910
基本上必须要对自己感兴趣，这样才能很好地进行推理
basically has to be on themselves that will be interesting to do inference okay

1256
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:32,920
基本上必须要对自己感兴趣，这样才能很好地进行推理
will be interesting to do inference okay so there is lots of things that I said

1257
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,319
所以我在那儿说了很多事情，但其中一些基本上是
will be interesting to do inference okay so there is lots of things that I said

1258
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:38,020
所以我在那儿说了很多事情，但其中一些基本上是
so there is lots of things that I said there but some of them basically are

1259
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:38,030
所以我在那儿说了很多事情，但其中一些基本上是
there but some of them basically are sort of common strands coming in the

1260
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:40,809
在此直接草稿的背景下，有种共同点
there but some of them basically are sort of common strands coming in the

1261
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:42,460
在此直接草稿的背景下，有种共同点
sort of common strands coming in the context of the direct draft from this

1262
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:42,470
在此直接草稿的背景下，有种共同点
context of the direct draft from this relation there is no point of doing

1263
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,410
关系是没有意义的站等于他们的答案
context of the direct draft from this relation there is no point of doing

1264
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,240
关系是没有意义的站等于他们的答案
relation there is no point of doing stations that they are equal to answer

1265
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:46,250
关系是没有意义的站等于他们的答案
stations that they are equal to answer what you need to do is prune leaves that

1266
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,000
您需要做的是基本上没有观察到的李子叶，如果有的话
stations that they are equal to answer what you need to do is prune leaves that

1267
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,930
您需要做的是基本上没有观察到的李子叶，如果有的话
what you need to do is prune leaves that are basically unobserved and if you have

1268
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:52,940
您需要做的是基本上没有观察到的李子叶，如果有的话
are basically unobserved and if you have evidence you have to be careful to know

1269
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,549
证据，您必须要小心知道，因为证据会将图形分开，并且
are basically unobserved and if you have evidence you have to be careful to know

1270
00:44:54,549 --> 00:44:56,859
证据，您必须要小心知道，因为证据会将图形分开，并且
evidence you have to be careful to know because evidence splits the graph and

1271
00:44:56,859 --> 00:44:56,869
证据，您必须要小心知道，因为证据会将图形分开，并且
because evidence splits the graph and then you may be able to have inference

1272
00:44:56,869 --> 00:44:59,020
那么您可能可以在这种情况下通过三种不同的方式进行推断
because evidence splits the graph and then you may be able to have inference

1273
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,870
那么您可能可以在这种情况下通过三种不同的方式进行推断
then you may be able to have inference in like this case with three different

1274
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:01,880
那么您可能可以在这种情况下通过三种不同的方式进行推断
in like this case with three different graphs so we're going to stop doing

1275
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:07,750
图，所以我们将停止传递扭曲消息并进行泛化
in like this case with three different graphs so we're going to stop doing

1276
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:11,049
图，所以我们将停止传递扭曲消息并进行泛化
graphs so we're going to stop doing message passing on twist and generalize

1277
00:45:11,049 --> 00:45:11,059
图，所以我们将停止传递扭曲消息并进行泛化
message passing on twist and generalize the the algorithm we saw on on a chain

1278
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:15,870
我们在链上看到的算法，所以现在将在树上
message passing on twist and generalize the the algorithm we saw on on a chain

1279
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:20,170
我们在链上看到的算法，所以现在将在树上
the the algorithm we saw on on a chain so this now would be on the tree the

1280
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:20,180
我们在链上看到的算法，所以现在将在树上
so this now would be on the tree the same any are criticized know which the

1281
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:23,260
同样任何受到批评的人都知道一阶消除
so this now would be on the tree the same any are criticized know which the

1282
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,930
同样任何受到批评的人都知道一阶消除
same any are criticized know which the first order elimination

1283
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,569
我们将不得不采取某种方式消除音符，或者
same any are criticized know which the first order elimination

1284
00:45:28,569 --> 00:45:28,579
我们将不得不采取某种方式消除音符，或者


1285
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:32,150
我们将不得不采取某种方式消除音符，或者
we're gonna have to do some elimination of the notes right then one way or

1286
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:32,160
我们将不得不采取某种方式消除音符，或者
of the notes right then one way or another it's a tree I'm going to give

1287
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:37,999
另一个是一棵树，我要给你一个算法，这是今天的演讲
of the notes right then one way or another it's a tree I'm going to give

1288
00:45:37,999 --> 00:45:40,160
另一个是一棵树，我要给你一个算法，这是今天的演讲
another it's a tree I'm going to give you an algorithm is the lecture today

1289
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,170
另一个是一棵树，我要给你一个算法，这是今天的演讲
you an algorithm is the lecture today and that defines first-order but in this

1290
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,489
并定义了一阶，但在这种情况下，一阶是您开始
you an algorithm is the lecture today and that defines first-order but in this

1291
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:48,709
并定义了一阶，但在这种情况下，一阶是您开始
and that defines first-order but in this case the first order is you start

1292
00:45:48,709 --> 00:45:48,719
并定义了一阶，但在这种情况下，一阶是您开始
case the first order is you start basically from the left subtree which is

1293
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:51,799
基本上是从左边的子树开始，这是从左边开始
case the first order is you start basically from the left subtree which is

1294
00:45:51,799 --> 00:45:55,699
基本上是从左边的子树开始，这是从左边开始
basically from the left subtree which is this and you start from the left to the

1295
00:45:55,699 --> 00:45:55,709
基本上是从左边的子树开始，这是从左边开始
this and you start from the left to the right of 4 5 2 3 and 1

1296
00:45:55,709 --> 00:45:59,469
4 5 2 3和1 ok的右边，所以显然在每个sub 3中
this and you start from the left to the right of 4 5 2 3 and 1

1297
00:45:59,469 --> 00:46:02,929
4 5 2 3和1 ok的右边，所以显然在每个sub 3中
right of 4 5 2 3 and 1 ok so obviously in every sub 3 you have

1298
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:02,939
4 5 2 3和1 ok的右边，所以显然在每个sub 3中
ok so obviously in every sub 3 you have to start from the child's but always

1299
00:46:02,939 --> 00:46:04,370
从孩子的开始，但总是从左边开始，所以5到3个人都可以
ok so obviously in every sub 3 you have to start from the child's but always

1300
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:09,880
从孩子的开始，但总是从左边开始，所以5到3个人都可以
to start from the child's but always from the left so for 5 to 3 anyone ok I

1301
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:09,890
从孩子的开始，但总是从左边开始，所以5到3个人都可以
from the left so for 5 to 3 anyone ok I gave here that's gonna stack you want to

1302
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,169
给了你要单击它的堆栈，但是我要给你
from the left so for 5 to 3 anyone ok I gave here that's gonna stack you want to

1303
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,969
给了你要单击它的堆栈，但是我要给你
gave here that's gonna stack you want to click it but I'm going to give you the

1304
00:46:13,969 --> 00:46:13,979
给了你要单击它的堆栈，但是我要给你
click it but I'm going to give you the algorithm and all of this algorithms

1305
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,160
算法以及您在Threes上看到的所有这些算法
click it but I'm going to give you the algorithm and all of this algorithms

1306
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,689
算法以及您在Threes上看到的所有这些算法
algorithm and all of this algorithms that you would see on Three's they're

1307
00:46:17,689 --> 00:46:17,699
算法以及您在Threes上看到的所有这些算法
that you would see on Three's they're already cursing so I don't know if you

1308
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:19,910
已经在咒骂，所以我不知道您是否曾经用递归编程
that you would see on Three's they're already cursing so I don't know if you

1309
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,559
已经在咒骂，所以我不知道您是否曾经用递归编程
already cursing so I don't know if you ever programmed anything with recursive

1310
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:21,569
已经在咒骂，所以我不知道您是否曾经用递归编程
ever programmed anything with recursive algorithms but sort of you need to get

1311
00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:24,289
算法，但是当您执行某种消息时，您需要习惯
ever programmed anything with recursive algorithms but sort of you need to get

1312
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:27,890
算法，但是当您执行某种消息时，您需要习惯
algorithms but sort of you need to get used to when you do sort of message

1313
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:27,900
算法，但是当您执行某种消息时，您需要习惯
used to when you do sort of message passing algorithm okay so let me we have

1314
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:34,699
通过算法好吧，让我进行一阶消除，我要
used to when you do sort of message passing algorithm okay so let me we have

1315
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:39,079
通过算法好吧，让我进行一阶消除，我要
passing algorithm okay so let me we have a first order elimination and I'm gonna

1316
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:39,089
通过算法好吧，让我进行一阶消除，我要
a first order elimination and I'm gonna give you a message passing version of

1317
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:42,229
给您一个消除算法的消息传递版本，所以说
a first order elimination and I'm gonna give you a message passing version of

1318
00:46:42,229 --> 00:46:43,819
给您一个消除算法的消息传递版本，所以说
give you a message passing version of the elimination algorithm so let's say

1319
00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:43,829
给您一个消除算法的消息传递版本，所以说
the elimination algorithm so let's say let's say that we're interested we have

1320
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:46,249
假设我们很感兴趣，我们有证据证明现在有2和X 4和X 5
the elimination algorithm so let's say let's say that we're interested we have

1321
00:46:46,249 --> 00:46:48,819
假设我们很感兴趣，我们有证据证明现在有2和X 4和X 5
let's say that we're interested we have evidence of now such 2 and X 4 and X 5

1322
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:48,829
假设我们很感兴趣，我们有证据证明现在有2和X 4和X 5
evidence of now such 2 and X 4 and X 5 right and somebody tells you compute the

1323
00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:52,849
正确，有人告诉您计算X 3的条件，所以基本上
evidence of now such 2 and X 4 and X 5 right and somebody tells you compute the

1324
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:55,849
正确，有人告诉您计算X 3的条件，所以基本上
right and somebody tells you compute the conditional of X 3 okay so basically

1325
00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:55,859
正确，有人告诉您计算X 3的条件，所以基本上
conditional of X 3 okay so basically what we need to do is we need to

1326
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:58,449
我们需要做的是我们需要在这里集成X 1，所以让我们
conditional of X 3 okay so basically what we need to do is we need to

1327
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:01,459
我们需要做的是我们需要在这里集成X 1，所以让我们
what we need to do is we need to integrate X 1 here all right so let's

1328
00:47:01,459 --> 00:47:01,469
我们需要做的是我们需要在这里集成X 1，所以让我们
integrate X 1 here all right so let's say the factorization theorist myself

1329
00:47:01,469 --> 00:47:07,209
我自己说因式分解理论家，您知道所有的潜力
integrate X 1 here all right so let's say the factorization theorist myself

1330
00:47:07,209 --> 00:47:10,249
我自己说因式分解理论家，您知道所有的潜力
say the factorization theorist myself you know certain all potentials which

1331
00:47:10,249 --> 00:47:10,259
我自己说因式分解理论家，您知道所有的潜力
you know certain all potentials which are based at least evidence modify

1332
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:12,499
至少根据证据可以改变耳聋的可能性
you know certain all potentials which are based at least evidence modify

is just the cost so what is that if we are going to put some words to

1395
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,530
如果我们要说几句话来定义它，那么这里的符号是固定的

similarly the message from x3 to x1 which is lit alright so we're rewriting

1424
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:40,920
没关系，所以我们现在要重写此等式
similarly the message from x3 to x1 which is lit alright so we're rewriting

00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:55,630
仅按x2的比例，我不触摸它们，并且有目标x1，所以让我们看一下
there is destination x1 so let's look at this list very carefully it says take

1433
00:50:55,630 --> 00:51:00,150
这个清单非常仔细，说要拿证据，所以我们有两个肚子
there is destination x1 so let's look at this list very carefully it says take

however I can tell too late the message from X 1 to X 3 at the same time as I

1526
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,870
从X 1到X 3同时计算从2到1的消息，所以
however I can tell too late the message from X 1 to X 3 at the same time as I

1527
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:12,950
从X 1到X 3同时计算从2到1的消息，所以
from X 1 to X 3 at the same time as I calculate the messages from 2 to 1 so

1528
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:12,960
从X 1到X 3同时计算从2到1的消息，所以
calculate the messages from 2 to 1 so actually you can do all of this in

1529
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,140
实际上，您可以并行执行所有这些操作，但是您基本上需要
calculate the messages from 2 to 1 so actually you can do all of this in

1530
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,900
实际上，您可以并行执行所有这些操作，但是您基本上需要
actually you can do all of this in parallel right but you need to basically

1531
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:17,910
实际上，您可以并行执行所有这些操作，但是您基本上需要
parallel right but you need to basically have a scheme that says you can only

1532
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:20,330
有一个方案说您只能传播，如果您只能计算
parallel right but you need to basically have a scheme that says you can only

1533
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:22,010
有一个方案说您只能传播，如果您只能计算

1534
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:22,020
有一个方案说您只能传播，如果您只能计算
propagate if you can only calculate the message will not have to know so you can

1535
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,410
消息将不必知道，因此您可以传播，比如说来自公路的消息
propagate if you can only calculate the message will not have to know so you can

1536
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,300
消息将不必知道，因此您可以传播，比如说来自公路的消息
message will not have to know so you can propagate let's say a message from road

1537
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:26,310
消息将不必知道，因此您可以传播，比如说来自公路的消息
propagate let's say a message from road 1 2 3 all the whole incoming messages to

1538
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:29,840
1 2 3到节点1的所有传入消息已经全部存在
propagate let's say a message from road 1 2 3 all the whole incoming messages to

1540
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:31,380
1 2 3到节点1的所有传入消息已经全部存在
node 1 are already there this is like doing power programming

1541
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,800
这就像在进行电源编程一样，然后您说您知道是否
node 1 are already there this is like doing power programming

1542
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,450
这就像在进行电源编程一样，然后您说您知道是否
this is like doing power programming right then you say you know if you

1543
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:35,460
这就像在进行电源编程一样，然后您说您知道是否
right then you say you know if you noticed executing and sending

1544
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,090
注意到在所有其他地方执行和发送信息

us have cell phones actually I don't know why they should look here like

1560
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:07,180
我们实际上有手机我不知道为什么他们应该看起来像这样
know why they should look here like ellipsis but so of this unknown okay so

1561
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:11,580
省略号，但是这个未知的好吧，所以我们说这有点问题
know why they should look here like ellipsis but so of this unknown okay so

1562
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,140
省略号，但是这个未知的好吧，所以我们说这有点问题
ellipsis but so of this unknown okay so let's say that this is something up

1563
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:13,150
省略号，但是这个未知的好吧，所以我们说这有点问题
let's say that this is something up there the root node this is no block aye

1564
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,450
那里的根节点不是块，这是J，我们要计算
let's say that this is something up there the root node this is no block aye

1565
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:20,550
那里的根节点不是块，这是J，我们要计算
there the root node this is no block aye and this is J and we want to compute the

1566
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:20,560
那里的根节点不是块，这是J，我们要计算
and this is J and we want to compute the message a sense to know died

1567
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,600
消息使人知道死亡，所以消息Jason仍然活着
and this is J and we want to compute the message a sense to know died

1568
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,060
消息使人知道死亡，所以消息Jason仍然活着
message a sense to know died so the message Jason still alive again

1569
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:27,070
消息使人知道死亡，所以消息Jason仍然活着
so the message Jason still alive again don't look at the equations right it

1570
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,310
不要看方程式正确，这将是非陪审团的电池潜力
so the message Jason still alive again don't look at the equations right it

1571
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:32,720
不要看方程式正确，这将是非陪审团的电池潜力
don't look at the equations right it would be the cell potential of non-jury

1572
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:32,730
不要看方程式正确，这将是非陪审团的电池潜力
would be the cell potential of non-jury right the joint potential of

1573
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,730
对神经科学的联合潜力a和所有人的乘积
would be the cell potential of non-jury right the joint potential of

1574
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:38,790
对神经科学的联合潜力a和所有人的乘积
right the joint potential of neuroscience a and the product of all

1575
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:38,800
对神经科学的联合潜力a和所有人的乘积
neuroscience a and the product of all the messages arriving today from all of

1576
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,460
今天从所有这些邻居那里收到的消息，除了没有死，都是
neuroscience a and the product of all the messages arriving today from all of

1577
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:47,130
今天从所有这些邻居那里收到的消息，除了没有死，都是
the messages arriving today from all of these neighbors except no die so are all

1578
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:47,140
今天从所有这些邻居那里收到的消息，除了没有死，都是
these neighbors except no die so are all the message to the right from below and

1579
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:48,840
从下面向右的消息，然后是gusano J，或者这意味着我们
these neighbors except no die so are all the message to the right from below and

1580
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,140
从下面向右的消息，然后是gusano J，或者这意味着我们
the message to the right from below and then gusano J or which means we

1581
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:52,150
从下面向右的消息，然后是gusano J，或者这意味着我们
then gusano J or which means we eliminate a okay so summation J of the

1582
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:58,200
消除一个好，所以求和XJ的细胞电势的J为联合电势
then gusano J or which means we eliminate a okay so summation J of the

1583
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,900
消除一个好，所以求和XJ的细胞电势的J为联合电势
eliminate a okay so summation J of the cell potential of XJ the joint potential

1584

邻居，除了我们，您不会忍受不死消息
stand to use to no die a message you received a line and actually that's a

1591
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:17,040
收到一行，这实际上是一个非常哲学的陈述，如果
stand to use to no die a message you received a line and actually that's a

00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:24,760
您有兴趣可以给您信息以阅读有关内容，因此
information to read about it alright so in other ways you know if you don't you

1597
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,460
通过其他方式，您知道是否知道自己可能想让自己感觉到
information to read about it alright so in other ways you know if you don't you

1602
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:35,310
很好，并向自己发送消息，但这实际上是您的问题
that actually it your problem letter problem okay

我们不要杀死僵化的人，因为这与领土无关
nothing with territory to be okay any question some of this is actually the

1608
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:53,110
问题，这实际上是爱荷华州吗？你能告诉我这是什么吗？
nothing with territory to be okay any question some of this is actually the

1609
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,030
问题，这实际上是爱荷华州吗？你能告诉我这是什么吗？
question some of this is actually the Iowa does can you tell me what's the

1610
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:55,040
问题，这实际上是爱荷华州吗？你能告诉我这是什么吗？
Iowa does can you tell me what's the difference of the difference from the

1611
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,040
与我们之前看到的链算法的差异之间的差异
Iowa does can you tell me what's the difference of the difference from the

1612
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,930
与我们之前看到的链算法的差异之间的差异
difference of the difference from the chain algorithm that we saw before right

1613
00:56:58,930 --> 00:56:58,940
与我们之前看到的链算法的差异之间的差异
chain algorithm that we saw before right just one big chain so look at this and

1614
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,720
只是一个大连锁店，所以看看这个，告诉我与以前有什么不同
chain algorithm that we saw before right just one big chain so look at this and

1615
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,130
只是一个大连锁店，所以看看这个，告诉我与以前有什么不同
just one big chain so look at this and tell me what is different from before

1616
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:03,140
只是一个大连锁店，所以看看这个，告诉我与以前有什么不同
tell me what is different from before every single term that looks different

1617
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:06,850
每个看起来都不同的术语
tell me what is different from before every single term that looks different

1618
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,300
这里有什么不同，例如，在一个链条中，什么是小产品，什么
tell me what is different from before every single term that looks different

1619
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:09,310
这里有什么不同，例如，在一个链条中，什么是小产品，什么


1620
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:18,400
这里有什么不同，例如，在一个链条中，什么是小产品，什么
what is different here for example in a chain what was it a little product what

1621
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:18,410
这里有什么不同，例如，在一个链条中，什么是小产品，什么
chain what was it a little product what did we have if you have a chain this one

1622
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:22,270
如果您有一条没有北或另一节点的链条，我们怎么办？
chain what was it a little product what did we have if you have a chain this one

1623
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:25,060
如果您有一条没有北或另一节点的链条，我们怎么办？
did we have if you have a chain this one no the northern or another node so how

1624
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:25,070
如果您有一条没有北或另一节点的链条，我们怎么办？
no the northern or another node so how many neighbors except I do we have work

1625
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,250
许多邻居，除了我，我们为节点a工作，所以这里只有
no the northern or another node so how many neighbors except I do we have work

1626
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:33,520
许多邻居，除了我，我们为节点a工作，所以这里只有
many neighbors except I do we have work for the nodes a so here there is only

1627
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:33,530
许多邻居，除了我，我们为节点a工作，所以这里只有
for the nodes a so here there is only one the incoming method alright and what

1628
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:39,880
一种传入的方法好吧，我们没有明确的权利，而您
for the nodes a so here there is only one the incoming method alright and what

1629
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,100
一种传入的方法好吧，我们没有明确的权利，而您
one the incoming method alright and what we do not have explicitly right and you

1630
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:42,110
一种传入的方法好吧，我们没有明确的权利，而您
we do not have explicitly right and you know again it makes no difference we do

1631
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:45,940
再次知道这没有什么区别，我们没有这一步潜力，那就是
we do not have explicitly right and you know again it makes no difference we do

1632
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:50,800
再次知道这没有什么区别，我们没有这一步潜力，那就是
know again it makes no difference we do not have this step potential that is

1633
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:50,810
再次知道这没有什么区别，我们没有这一步潜力，那就是
not have this step potential that is listen to incorporate basically evidence

1634
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:53,350
听取基本上包括证据就可以了，所以这个已经存在了
not have this step potential that is listen to incorporate basically evidence

1635
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:56,410
听取基本上包括证据就可以了，所以这个已经存在了
listen to incorporate basically evidence okay so this was already there this was

1636
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:56,420
听取基本上包括证据就可以了，所以这个已经存在了
okay so this was already there this was only one term and elimination of XJ this

1637
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:59,320
只有一个词和XJ消除这种关系，这是他们的信息
okay so this was already there this was only one term and elimination of XJ this

1638
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,150
只有一个词和XJ消除这种关系，这是他们的信息
only one term and elimination of XJ this relationship that's the message they

1639
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:01,160
只有一个词和XJ消除这种关系，这是他们的信息
relationship that's the message they send out okay so if you want to compute

1640
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:08,070
发送好吧，所以如果您想计算那么多，这些计算表明
relationship that's the message they send out okay so if you want to compute

1641
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:10,420
发送好吧，所以如果您想计算那么多，这些计算表明
send out okay so if you want to compute so many do these calculations that say

1642
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:10,430
发送好吧，所以如果您想计算那么多，这些计算表明
so many do these calculations that say your interest to go on and find the

1643
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:12,870
您有兴趣继续并根据给定的条件找到根节点的条件

您有兴趣继续并根据给定的条件找到根节点的条件
conditional of the root node given the evidence in this case okay so let me

1646
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:21,760
在这种情况下的证据还可以，所以让我，因为我在这里看到了计算结果
conditional of the root node given the evidence in this case okay so let me

1647
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,760
在这种情况下的证据还可以，所以让我，因为我在这里看到了计算结果
evidence in this case okay so let me because I see the calculation here

1648
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:23,770
在这种情况下的证据还可以，所以让我，因为我在这里看到了计算结果
because I see the calculation here remind me when we wanted to find the

1649
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:26,170
提醒我，当我们想找到边际违法知识时，我们做了什么
because I see the calculation here remind me when we wanted to find the

1650
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,000
提醒我，当我们想找到边际违法知识时，我们做了什么
remind me when we wanted to find the marginal offending knowledge what did we

1651
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,010
提醒我，当我们想找到边际违法知识时，我们做了什么
marginal offending knowledge what did we do on the chain when we want to find the

1652
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:32,230
当我们想找到任何否的边际时，在链上做
marginal offending knowledge what did we do on the chain when we want to find the

1653
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:35,200
当我们想找到任何否的边际时，在链上做
do on the chain when we want to find the marginal of any No

1654
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:35,650
俗话说，你知道有左右两边的知识，所以
do on the chain when we want to find the marginal of any No

1655
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:35,660
俗话说，你知道有左右两边的知识，所以


1656
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,440
俗话说，你知道有左右两边的知识，所以
the in the saying you know there was left and right to have the knowledge so

1657
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:38,450
俗话说，你知道有左右两边的知识，所以
left and right to have the knowledge so what do we do

1658
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,450
我们该怎么做，我们采取了主人的性格
left and right to have the knowledge so what do we do

1659
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,620
我们该怎么做，我们采取了主人的性格
what do we do we took the Masters character of the

1660
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:41,630
我们该怎么做，我们采取了主人的性格
we took the Masters character of the left the mess is coming from the right

1661
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:43,450
左乱七八糟是从右边来的，我们的口味将是任何东西
we took the Masters character of the left the mess is coming from the right

1662
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:44,890
左乱七八糟是从右边来的，我们的口味将是任何东西
left the mess is coming from the right in general our taste will be whatever

1663
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:44,900
左乱七八糟是从右边来的，我们的口味将是任何东西
in general our taste will be whatever the Masters are coming if we multiply we

1664
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,200
大师们来了，如果我们相乘，我们就让他们变得微不足道，现在我尝试看看
in general our taste will be whatever the Masters are coming if we multiply we

1665
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,269
大师们来了，如果我们相乘，我们就让他们变得微不足道，现在我尝试看看
the Masters are coming if we multiply we get them the marginal now I try to look

1666
00:58:49,269 --> 00:58:49,279
大师们来了，如果我们相乘，我们就让他们变得微不足道，现在我尝试看看
get them the marginal now I try to look at the roof no don't leave any messages

1667
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:52,359
在屋顶上，请不要在上面留下任何消息，因此，
get them the marginal now I try to look at the roof no don't leave any messages

1668
00:58:52,359 --> 00:58:55,809
在屋顶上，请不要在上面留下任何消息，因此，
at the roof no don't leave any messages coming from above good note so the

1669
00:58:55,809 --> 00:58:55,819
在屋顶上，请不要在上面留下任何消息，因此，
coming from above good note so the message is coming from from below so

1670
00:58:55,819 --> 00:58:58,660
消息是从下面传来的，所以基本上您所拥有的就是
coming from above good note so the message is coming from from below so

1671
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,479
消息是从下面传来的，所以基本上您所拥有的就是
message is coming from from below so basically what you have is all the

1672
00:59:01,479 --> 00:59:01,489
消息是从下面传来的，所以基本上您所拥有的就是
basically what you have is all the message is coming to the root node from

1673
00:59:01,489 --> 00:59:03,430
消息显然从下面的时间从其邻居到达根节点
basically what you have is all the message is coming to the root node from

1674
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:06,460
消息显然从下面的时间从其邻居到达根节点
message is coming to the root node from its neighbors from below times obviously

1675
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:06,470
消息显然从下面的时间从其邻居到达根节点
its neighbors from below times obviously I have to put the search potential of

1676
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:09,450
如果根节点不是一个，我必须把根节点的搜索潜力确定为
its neighbors from below times obviously I have to put the search potential of

1677
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:13,420
如果根节点不是一个，我必须把根节点的搜索潜力确定为
I have to put the search potential of the root node okay if it is not one and

1678
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:13,430
如果根节点不是一个，我必须把根节点的搜索潜力确定为
the root node okay if it is not one and then if you want you to normalize this

1679
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:15,609
然后，如果您希望以共享分母的方式对此进行规范化
the root node okay if it is not one and then if you want you to normalize this

1680
00:59:15,609 --> 00:59:18,359
然后，如果您希望以共享分母的方式对此进行规范化
then if you want you to normalize this the way you share the denominator

1681
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:18,369
然后，如果您希望以共享分母的方式对此进行规范化
the way you share the denominator obviously this equation will apply to

1682
00:59:18,369 --> 00:59:21,430
显然，该方程式适用于任何要查找的节点
the way you share the denominator obviously this equation will apply to

1683
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,880
显然，该方程式适用于任何要查找的节点
obviously this equation will apply to any node which if you want to find the

1684
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:24,890
显然，该方程式适用于任何要查找的节点
any node which if you want to find the marginal of no ties you take the

1685
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,920
无边际的边缘，您会考虑所有即将来临的消息的结果
any node which if you want to find the marginal of no ties you take the

1686
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,660
无边际的边缘，您会考虑所有即将来临的消息的结果
marginal of no ties you take the products of all of the messages coming

1687
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:28,670
无边际的边缘，您会考虑所有即将来临的消息的结果
products of all of the messages coming up now die from below all right and then

1688
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:33,400
现在从下面消失，然后在这里归一化，您可以
products of all of the messages coming up now die from below all right and then

1689
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,930
现在从下面消失，然后在这里归一化，您可以
up now die from below all right and then just normalize here and you can get the

1690
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:34,940
现在从下面消失，然后在这里归一化，您可以
just normalize here and you can get the conditional of node I given the evidence

1691
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:38,190
有条件的节点我给出了证据，实际上没有，这就是表格
just normalize here and you can get the conditional of node I given the evidence

1692
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:40,839
有条件的节点我给出了证据，实际上没有，这就是表格
conditional of node I given the evidence and actually no that's the table

1693
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:40,849
有条件的节点我给出了证据，实际上没有，这就是表格
and actually no that's the table question okay well say sphere your

1694
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:45,579
问题好吧，请说出您的相似方程来求边际
and actually no that's the table question okay well say sphere your

问题好吧，请说出您的相似方程来求边际
similar equations to find the marginal at every node okay now the bottom line

1697
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:52,930
现在在每个节点上都可以看到最底线，也许就像我们用红色标出的那样
similar equations to find the marginal at every node okay now the bottom line

1698
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:55,539
现在在每个节点上都可以看到最底线，也许就像我们用红色标出的那样
at every node okay now the bottom line and maybe as we have put this with red

1699
00:59:55,539 --> 00:59:55,549
现在在每个节点上都可以看到最底线，也许就像我们用红色标出的那样
and maybe as we have put this with red letters or something coloring there is

1700
00:59:55,549 --> 00:59:57,430
字母或一些与此有关的颜色现在称量它呈线性比例
and maybe as we have put this with red letters or something coloring there is

1701
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:59,650

actually we finished today doing different examples because they look

1712
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:25,749
不同的例子，因为它们看起来微不足道，现在您应该告诉我
actually we finished today doing different examples because they look

01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:28,700
不同的例子，因为它们看起来微不足道，现在您应该告诉我
trivial now you should've told me that in the homework some of you arrived on

1715
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,819
在家庭作业中，你们中的一些人开始做一些计算，
trivial now you should've told me that in the homework some of you arrived on

01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:32,630
在家庭作业中，你们中的一些人开始做一些计算，
doing calculations some calculations by can you not living problems some of you

1718
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:35,890
你能不能生活问题，你们中的一些人全都崩溃了吗
doing calculations some calculations by can you not living problems some of you

你能不能生活问题，你们中的一些人全都崩溃了吗
can you not living problems some of you were all down

1720
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:38,220
你能不能生活问题，你们中的一些人全都崩溃了吗
were all down some of this and that should be the

1721
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,160
其中一些，这应该是正确的答案，最后一个选项不是
were all down some of this and that should be the

1722
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,430
其中一些，这应该是正确的答案，最后一个选项不是
some of this and that should be the answer right the last one option is not

1723
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:43,440
其中一些，这应该是正确的答案，最后一个选项不是
answer right the last one option is not a good one we have tried the lighted by

1724
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,980
我们已经尝试过一个很好的方法，由Chen点燃来进行所有计算，或者
answer right the last one option is not a good one we have tried the lighted by

1725
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,630
我们已经尝试过一个很好的方法，由Chen点燃来进行所有计算，或者
a good one we have tried the lighted by Chen to do all the calculations or

1726
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:47,640
我们已经尝试过一个很好的方法，由Chen点燃来进行所有计算，或者
Chen to do all the calculations or actually write a computer program to do

1727
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,150
实际上写一个计算机程序来做到这一点，但不要说你知道什么
Chen to do all the calculations or actually write a computer program to do

1728
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,780
实际上写一个计算机程序来做到这一点，但不要说你知道什么
actually write a computer program to do this but don't say what you know what

1729
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:52,790
实际上写一个计算机程序来做到这一点，但不要说你知道什么
this but don't say what you know what you multiply first and even your sound

1730
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:55,760
您首先要乘以声音，然后再乘以声音就可以解决问题
this but don't say what you know what you multiply first and even your sound

1731
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,530
您首先要乘以声音，然后再乘以声音就可以解决问题
you multiply first and even your sound and whatever comes out to be the answer

1732
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:57,540
您首先要乘以声音，然后再乘以声音就可以解决问题
and whatever comes out to be the answer that doesn't help

1733
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,630
如果我理解正确的话那是没有帮助的
and whatever comes out to be the answer that doesn't help

1734
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:03,770
如果我理解正确的话那是没有帮助的
that doesn't help right if I understood correctly okay

1735
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:03,780
如果我理解正确的话那是没有帮助的
right if I understood correctly okay something like that so let's take a

1736
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:07,250
像这样的事情，让我们举一个简单的例子，我们对这里感兴趣
right if I understood correctly okay something like that so let's take a

1737
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:12,470
像这样的事情，让我们举一个简单的例子，我们对这里感兴趣
something like that so let's take a simple case we are interested here to

1738
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:12,480
像这样的事情，让我们举一个简单的例子，我们对这里感兴趣
simple case we are interested here to complete the marginals in this temple

1739
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,140
完成这庙宇树的边缘，所以很明显，我们将拥有
simple case we are interested here to complete the marginals in this temple

1740
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:20,570
完成这庙宇树的边缘，所以很明显，我们将拥有
complete the marginals in this temple tree so obviously we're going to have

1741
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:20,580
完成这庙宇树的边缘，所以很明显，我们将拥有
tree so obviously we're going to have some post positive elimination here and

1742
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:24,410
一些后消极在这里，这个地方将是这个节点和这个
tree so obviously we're going to have some post positive elimination here and

1743
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,750
一些后消极在这里，这个地方将是这个节点和这个
some post positive elimination here and this place will be this node and this

1744
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:26,760
一些后消极在这里，这个地方将是这个节点和这个
this place will be this node and this and this and that

1745
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,770
这个，那好吧，我们要开始发送
this place will be this node and this and this and that

1746
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:29,630
这个，那好吧，我们要开始发送
and this and that okay so we're gonna start sending

1747
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:29,640
这个，那好吧，我们要开始发送
okay so we're gonna start sending messages from the leaves all the way up

1748
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,589
消息从叶子一直传到根，这样我就可以将这些消息发送出去
okay so we're gonna start sending messages from the leaves all the way up

1749
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:36,200
消息从叶子一直传到根，这样我就可以将这些消息发送出去
messages from the leaves all the way up to the root so I can send this messes up

1750
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:36,210
消息从叶子一直传到根，这样我就可以将这些消息发送出去
to the root so I can send this messes up in this message simultaneously and once

1751
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:39,800
同时在此消息中，一旦知道树已收到这两个
to the root so I can send this messes up in this message simultaneously and once

1752
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,599
同时在此消息中，一旦知道树已收到这两个
in this message simultaneously and once know the tree has received this two

1753
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:41,609
同时在此消息中，一旦知道树已收到这两个
know the tree has received this two messages then I can send the message to

1754
01:01:41,609 --> 01:01:43,190
消息，然后我可以将消息发送到顶部两点，我们应该正确
know the tree has received this two messages then I can send the message to

1755
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:47,060
消息，然后我可以将消息发送到顶部两点，我们应该正确
messages then I can send the message to the top two o'clock we should have right

1756
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:47,070
消息，然后我可以将消息发送到顶部两点，我们应该正确
the top two o'clock we should have right so we didn't do this all up the same

1757
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,910
所以我们并没有在同一步骤中完成所有操作，而是向此处发送一条消息
the top two o'clock we should have right so we didn't do this all up the same

1758
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:51,740
所以我们并没有在同一步骤中完成所有操作，而是向此处发送一条消息
so we didn't do this all up the same step right here send one message to this

1759
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:51,750
所以我们并没有在同一步骤中完成所有操作，而是向此处发送一条消息
step right here send one message to this together then you can send the messages

1760
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:54,770
然后，您可以发送邮件，一旦打开
step right here send one message to this together then you can send the messages

1761
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:56,780
然后，您可以发送邮件，一旦打开
together then you can send the messages once you have that you can turn the

1762
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:56,790
然后，您可以发送邮件，一旦打开
once you have that you can turn the message to no one once node one has

1763
01:01:56,790 --> 01:02:01,130
节点一收到此消息后就没有消息发送给他们
once you have that you can turn the message to no one once node one has

1764
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,720
节点一收到此消息后就没有消息发送给他们
message to no one once node one has received this message then can send them

1765
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:02,730
节点一收到此消息后就没有消息发送给他们
received this message then can send them a message back you know - all right so

1766
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:07,930
返回一条消息，您知道-好的，所以节点1发送一条消息1 2 2 2和
received this message then can send them a message back you know - all right so

1767
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:11,300
返回一条消息，您知道-好的，所以节点1发送一条消息1 2 2 2和
a message back you know - all right so so node 1 sends a message a 1 2 2 2 and

1768
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:11,310
返回一条消息，您知道-好的，所以节点1发送一条消息1 2 2 2和
so node 1 sends a message a 1 2 2 2 and then you are ready to do what now is

1769
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:15,650
那么您就可以开始执行此操作了，现在可以将消息发送给
so node 1 sends a message a 1 2 2 2 and then you are ready to do what now is

1770
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:17,420
那么您就可以开始执行此操作了，现在可以将消息发送给
then you are ready to do what now is this now ready to send the message to

1771
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:17,430
那么您就可以开始执行此操作了，现在可以将消息发送给
this now ready to send the message to North Korea would be we need to send a

1772
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:20,450
朝鲜是我们需要从2到3发送消息
this now ready to send the message to North Korea would be we need to send a

1773
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:23,359
朝鲜是我们需要从2到3发送消息
North Korea would be we need to send a message from 2 to 3

1774
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:24,930
您需要知道所有传入的消息，这就是这个，而这个您
North Korea would be we need to send a message from 2 to 3

1775
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:24,940
您需要知道所有传入的消息，这就是这个，而这个您


1776
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:29,970
您需要知道所有传入的消息，这就是这个，而这个您
you need to know all the incoming message which is this and this which you

1777
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:29,980
您需要知道所有传入的消息，这就是这个，而这个您
message which is this and this which you calculate it so then you can send the

1778
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,010
计算它，然后您就可以将消息从两到三发送给您了
message which is this and this which you calculate it so then you can send the

1779
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:36,060
计算它，然后您就可以将消息从两到三发送给您了
calculate it so then you can send the message to you know from two to three

1780
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:36,070
计算它，然后您就可以将消息从两到三发送给您了
message to you know from two to three which is this message here and then what

1781
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:39,840
这是这条消息，然后如果需要，我们需要先发送该消息
message to you know from two to three which is this message here and then what

1782
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,480
这是这条消息，然后如果需要，我们需要先发送该消息
which is this message here and then what we need to send the message before if

1783
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:42,490
这是这条消息，然后如果需要，我们需要先发送该消息
we need to send the message before if you need this and you need that so if

1784
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:44,670
您需要它，并且您需要它，因此，如果您可以将消息发送到第四个
we need to send the message before if you need this and you need that so if

1785
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:46,110
您需要它，并且您需要它，因此，如果您可以将消息发送到第四个
you need this and you need that so if you can send the message to the fourth

1786
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:46,120
您需要它，并且您需要它，因此，如果您可以将消息发送到第四个
you can send the message to the fourth so effectively actually once did you get

1787
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,650
如此有效，实际上，一旦收到此消息，您就可以关闭任何
you can send the message to the fourth so effectively actually once did you get

1788
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:52,110
如此有效，实际上，一旦收到此消息，您就可以关闭任何
so effectively actually once did you get this message here you can turn off any

1789
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:52,120
如此有效，实际上，一旦收到此消息，您就可以关闭任何
this message here you can turn off any stunts all sending messages to walk

1790
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,910
阻碍所有发送消息以遍历所有三个消息，不，这是为您而准备的
this message here you can turn off any stunts all sending messages to walk

1791
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:55,830
阻碍所有发送消息以遍历所有三个消息，不，这是为您而准备的
stunts all sending messages to walk through all three and no it's for as you

1792
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:55,840
阻碍所有发送消息以遍历所有三个消息，不，这是为您而准备的
through all three and no it's for as you see here okay

1793
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,000
这些混乱完成后，您可以在这里看到，您可以
through all three and no it's for as you see here okay

1794
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,910
这些混乱完成后，您可以在这里看到，您可以
see here okay once these messes are completed you can

01:02:59,910 --> 01:02:59,920
这些混乱完成后，您可以在这里看到，您可以
once these messes are completed you can go and calculate anything you want the

1796
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,760
去计算任何你想要的边际就可以对条件进行归一化
once these messes are completed you can go and calculate anything you want the

1797
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,580
去计算任何你想要的边际就可以对条件进行归一化
go and calculate anything you want the marginals you can normalize conditionals

1798
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:05,590
去计算任何你想要的边际就可以对条件进行归一化
marginals you can normalize conditionals you can put evidence you can do anything

1799
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:07,980
您可以证明您现在可以做任何您想做的事情，当您
marginals you can normalize conditionals you can put evidence you can do anything

1800
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,560
您可以证明您现在可以做任何您想做的事情，当您
you can put evidence you can do anything you want okay now obviously when you

1801
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:10,570
您可以证明您现在可以做任何您想做的事情，当您
you want okay now obviously when you program there is the tricky part is to

1802
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:13,650
程序中有一个棘手的部分是能够计算消息而不仅仅是一个
you want okay now obviously when you program there is the tricky part is to

1803
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:17,190
程序中有一个棘手的部分是能够计算消息而不仅仅是一个
program there is the tricky part is to be able to compute messages not just one

1804
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:17,200
程序中有一个棘手的部分是能够计算消息而不仅仅是一个
be able to compute messages not just one after the other but you have some

1805
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,200
一个接一个，但是你有一些算法说你知道我能做什么
be able to compute messages not just one after the other but you have some

1806
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,780
一个接一个，但是你有一些算法说你知道我能做什么
after the other but you have some algorithm that says you know what I can

1807
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:21,790
一个接一个，但是你有一些算法说你知道我能做什么
algorithm that says you know what I can compute this by simultaneously then once

1808
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:23,910
同时进行计算，一旦您在这里收到所有消息，我就可以
algorithm that says you know what I can compute this by simultaneously then once

1809
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:25,350
同时进行计算，一旦您在这里收到所有消息，我就可以
compute this by simultaneously then once you have all this message here I can

1810
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:25,360
同时进行计算，一旦您在这里收到所有消息，我就可以
you have all this message here I can compute the outgoing message etc etc so

1811
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:28,380
计算外发消息等，所以您需要某种方法来找出
you have all this message here I can compute the outgoing message etc etc so

1812
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:33,480
计算外发消息等，所以您需要某种方法来找出
compute the outgoing message etc etc so you need to have some way to figure out

1813
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:33,490
计算外发消息等，所以您需要某种方法来找出
you need to have some way to figure out when a node is ready to send messages to

1814
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:36,030
当一个节点准备好向邻居发送消息时，这两个
you need to have some way to figure out when a node is ready to send messages to

1815
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:41,070
当一个节点准备好向邻居发送消息时，这两个
when a node is ready to send messages to its neighbors all right is this two

1816
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:41,080
当一个节点准备好向邻居发送消息时，这两个
its neighbors all right is this two different different okay so in this

1817
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,250
不同，不同，好吧，所以在这张图中您可以看到重要性
its neighbors all right is this two different different okay so in this

1818
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:47,460
不同，不同，好吧，所以在这张图中您可以看到重要性
different different okay so in this graph you can see the importance

1819
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:47,470
不同，不同，好吧，所以在这张图中您可以看到重要性
graph you can see the importance actually for having a protocol to send

1820
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:50,490
实际上是因为有协议发送消息通知，但是在这里我可以
graph you can see the importance actually for having a protocol to send

1821
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:53,790
实际上是因为有协议发送消息通知，但是在这里我可以
actually for having a protocol to send messages notice but here I can

1822
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:53,800
实际上是因为有协议发送消息通知，但是在这里我可以
messages notice but here I can simultaneously end this messages that

1823
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,010
同时结束您在图B上看到的此消息，没有任何承诺
messages notice but here I can simultaneously end this messages that

1824
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:58,920
同时结束您在图B上看到的此消息，没有任何承诺
simultaneously end this messages that you see on a figure B no promises

1825
01:03:58,920 --> 01:03:58,930
同时结束您在图B上看到的此消息，没有任何承诺
you see on a figure B no promises promises all at the time and I can do

1826
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:01,890
承诺所有的时间，我可以做到这一点，因为这个节点还可以
you see on a figure B no promises promises all at the time and I can do

1827
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:04,890
承诺所有的时间，我可以做到这一点，因为这个节点还可以
promises all at the time and I can do this right because this node all right

1828
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:04,900
承诺所有的时间，我可以做到这一点，因为这个节点还可以
this right because this node all right can send the message there all right the

1829
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,830
可以在那里发送消息，没问题，这里一样
this right because this node all right can send the message there all right the

1830
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,330
可以在那里发送消息，没问题，这里一样
can send the message there all right the same here same there

1831
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:09,340
可以在那里发送消息，没问题，这里一样
same here same there all right so on the second stage I do

1832
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:12,120
好的，所以在第二阶段，我确实注意到带有虚线的消息
same here same there all right so on the second stage I do

1833
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,340
好的，所以在第二阶段，我确实注意到带有虚线的消息
all right so on the second stage I do notice messages with dotted lines to

1834
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:14,350
好的，所以在第二阶段，我确实注意到带有虚线的消息
notice messages with dotted lines to indicate that I calculate them

1835
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,840
表示我之前已经计算过，但是一旦放置，她就没有了
notice messages with dotted lines to indicate that I calculate them

1836
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,140
表示我之前已经计算过，但是一旦放置，她就没有了
indicate that I calculate them previously but once placed no she has

1837
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:19,150
表示我之前已经计算过，但是一旦放置，她就没有了
previously but once placed no she has received messages from the left and the

1838
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:20,610
从左右两边收到的消息可以执行的操作可以发送
previously but once placed no she has received messages from the left and the

1839
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:22,680
从左右两边收到的消息可以执行的操作可以发送
received messages from the left and the right where they can do it can send the

1840
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:22,690
从左右两边收到的消息可以执行的操作可以发送
right where they can do it can send the message to this node and once this node

1841
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:26,730
消息发送到此节点，并且一旦此节点在此接收到西密歇根州的
right where they can do it can send the message to this node and once this node

1842
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:28,950
消息发送到此节点，并且一旦此节点在此接收到西密歇根州的
message to this node and once this node here to receive this to West Michigan's

1843
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:28,960
消息发送到此节点，并且一旦此节点在此接收到西密歇根州的
here to receive this to West Michigan's tell the vessels

1844
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,489
告诉船只，所以在最后一步，你会注意到我
here to receive this to West Michigan's tell the vessels

1845
01:04:30,489 --> 01:04:34,569
告诉船只，所以在最后一步，你会注意到我
tell the vessels so on the last step you notice I make

1846
01:04:34,569 --> 01:04:34,579
告诉船只，所以在最后一步，你会注意到我
so on the last step you notice I make all these messages about it because they

1847
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:37,569
关于这些消息的所有这些消息，因为它们是在此注释之前（如果有）计算得出的
so on the last step you notice I make all these messages about it because they

1848
01:04:37,569 --> 01:04:40,989
关于这些消息的所有这些消息，因为它们是在此注释之前（如果有）计算得出的
all these messages about it because they calculated before and if if this note

1849
01:04:40,989 --> 01:04:40,999
关于这些消息的所有这些消息，因为它们是在此注释之前（如果有）计算得出的
calculated before and if if this note has a message from below has a message

1850
01:04:40,999 --> 01:04:43,719
从下面有一条消息从右边有一条消息，然后可以发送
calculated before and if if this note has a message from below has a message

1851
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:46,239
从下面有一条消息从右边有一条消息，然后可以发送
has a message from below has a message already from the right then it can send

1852
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:46,249
从下面有一条消息从右边有一条消息，然后可以发送
already from the right then it can send a message to this node similarly if this

1853
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:49,930
如果此节点有船只进入，则向该节点发送一条类似的消息
already from the right then it can send a message to this node similarly if this

1854
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:52,269
如果此节点有船只进入，则向该节点发送一条类似的消息
a message to this node similarly if this node has the vessels coming in as a

1855
01:04:52,269 --> 01:04:52,279
如果此节点有船只进入，则向该节点发送一条类似的消息
node has the vessels coming in as a message from the right it can send a

1856
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:54,309
正确的消息可以向该法律发送消息，这样您就永远
node has the vessels coming in as a message from the right it can send a

1857
01:04:54,309 --> 01:04:57,130
正确的消息可以向该法律发送消息，这样您就永远
message from the right it can send a message to this law okay so you never

1858
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:57,140
正确的消息可以向该法律发送消息，这样您就永远
message to this law okay so you never idea that what I mean a part of the

1859
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:00,940
我的意思是协议的一部分，基本上是用于发送消息的想法
message to this law okay so you never idea that what I mean a part of the

1860
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,829
我的意思是协议的一部分，基本上是用于发送消息的想法
idea that what I mean a part of the protocol basically for sending messages

1861
01:05:02,829 --> 01:05:02,839
我的意思是协议的一部分，基本上是用于发送消息的想法
protocol basically for sending messages if you do this sequentially obviously is

1862
01:05:02,839 --> 01:05:06,069
如果您依次执行此操作，显然不是一个好的算法，并且
protocol basically for sending messages if you do this sequentially obviously is

1863
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:08,589
如果您依次执行此操作，显然不是一个好的算法，并且
if you do this sequentially obviously is not gonna be a good algorithm and

1864
01:05:08,589 --> 01:05:08,599
如果您依次执行此操作，显然不是一个好的算法，并且
not gonna be a good algorithm and according the graph is going to be

1865
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:09,880
根据图将可能是如果您这样做正确时
not gonna be a good algorithm and according the graph is going to be

1866
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:14,589
根据图将可能是如果您这样做正确时
according the graph is going to be probably if you do this right when the

1867
01:05:14,589 --> 01:05:14,599
根据图将可能是如果您这样做正确时
probably if you do this right when the algorithm converges basically and gives

1868
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:16,539
算法基本上收敛，并给您转换后的结果
probably if you do this right when the algorithm converges basically and gives

1869
01:05:16,539 --> 01:05:19,660
算法基本上收敛，并给您转换后的结果
algorithm converges basically and gives you having converted it turns out what

1870
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:19,670
算法基本上收敛，并给您转换后的结果
you having converted it turns out what it finishes the cost will be two times

1871
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:21,910
它完成的成本将是边缘数量的两倍，因为基本上
you having converted it turns out what it finishes the cost will be two times

1872
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:24,339
它完成的成本将是边缘数量的两倍，因为基本上
it finishes the cost will be two times the number of edges because basically in

1873
01:05:24,339 --> 01:05:24,349
它完成的成本将是边缘数量的两倍，因为基本上
the number of edges because basically in every answer you have to send the

1874
01:05:24,349 --> 01:05:25,839
您必须发送的每个答案都将消息发送回去，因为
the number of edges because basically in every answer you have to send the

1875
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,779
您必须发送的每个答案都将消息发送回去，因为
every answer you have to send the messages going and coming back okay as

1876
01:05:28,779 --> 01:05:28,789
您必须发送的每个答案都将消息发送回去，因为
messages going and coming back okay as you see here alright so so the number of

1877
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:35,499
您在这里看到的很好，所以基本上将酒精放置的步骤数
messages going and coming back okay as you see here alright so so the number of

1878
01:05:35,499 --> 01:05:37,390
您在这里看到的很好，所以基本上将酒精放置的步骤数
you see here alright so so the number of steps basically the alcohol is placed

1879
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:37,400
您在这里看到的很好，所以基本上将酒精放置的步骤数
steps basically the alcohol is placed two times the number of edges in in in

1880
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,599
内边的数量是你的两倍
steps basically the alcohol is placed two times the number of edges in in in

1881
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:42,759
内边的数量是你的两倍
two times the number of edges in in in you

1882
01:05:42,759 --> 01:05:48,460
我是说我真的在这里尝尝
two times the number of edges in in in you

1883
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:48,470
我是说我真的在这里尝尝


1884
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:52,090
我是说我真的在这里尝尝
I mean I think I'm really here taste this

1885
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:52,100
我是说我真的在这里尝尝
this so the algorithm never blocks you know

1886
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:54,310
因此，该算法永远不会阻止您知道的交易，而不会发生，但是如果
this so the algorithm never blocks you know

1887
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:58,330
因此，该算法永远不会阻止您知道的交易，而不会发生，但是如果
so the algorithm never blocks you know for a trade without not happened but if

1888
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:58,340
因此，该算法永远不会阻止您知道的交易，而不会发生，但是如果
for a trade without not happened but if later on we will show the algorithm only

1889
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,580
稍后我们将展示该算法仅具有循环，很有可能
for a trade without not happened but if later on we will show the algorithm only

1890
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,830
稍后我们将展示该算法仅具有循环，很有可能
later on we will show the algorithm only have loops it's very possible you have

1891
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:02,840
稍后我们将展示该算法仅具有循环，很有可能
have loops it's very possible you have an algorithm that keeps going and

1892
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,810
保持运转并确保Everette正确的算法
have loops it's very possible you have an algorithm that keeps going and

1893
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:06,730
保持运转并确保Everette正确的算法
an algorithm that keeps going and Everette right

1894
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:06,740
保持运转并确保Everette正确的算法
Everette right keep sending message system you have

1895
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:08,320
不断发送消息系统，您一直处于循环状态，并且您正在
Everette right keep sending message system you have

1896
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,900
不断发送消息系统，您一直处于循环状态，并且您正在
keep sending message system you have constantly on the loop and you're in

1897
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:10,910
不断发送消息系统，您一直处于循环状态，并且您正在
constantly on the loop and you're in trouble all right so let me I'm gonna

1898
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:16,450
麻烦您了，让我结束这个例子，因为在这个例子中
constantly on the loop and you're in trouble all right so let me I'm gonna

1899
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:24,130
麻烦您了，让我结束这个例子，因为在这个例子中
trouble all right so let me I'm gonna finish this example because is in this

1900
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:24,140
麻烦您了，让我结束这个例子，因为在这个例子中
finish this example because is in this is the notation that I'm using is

1901
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:25,600
我使用的符号基本上就是您所知道的市场
finish this example because is in this is the notation that I'm using is

1902
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:31,120
我使用的符号基本上就是您所知道的市场
is the notation that I'm using is basically that of you know a market on

1903
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:31,130
我使用的符号基本上就是您所知道的市场
basically that of you know a market on the field that we used before

1904
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:32,440
之前我们使用过的领域，所以您知道我们有十大潜力
basically that of you know a market on the field that we used before

1905
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,710
之前我们使用过的领域，所以您知道我们有十大潜力
the field that we used before okay so you know we have ten potentials

1906
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:35,720
之前我们使用过的领域，所以您知道我们有十大潜力
okay so you know we have ten potentials here and if you want evidence you plug

1907
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,920
在这里，如果您需要证据，可以将它们作为患者的两个功能插入
okay so you know we have ten potentials here and if you want evidence you plug

1908
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:43,090
在这里，如果您需要证据，可以将它们作为患者的两个功能插入
here and if you want evidence you plug in them two functions as patient

1909
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:43,100
在这里，如果您需要证据，可以将它们作为患者的两个功能插入
in them two functions as patient slightly different but this for the same

1910
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,500
稍有不同，但这是相同的想法，所以说11个是节点
in them two functions as patient slightly different but this for the same

1911
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:49,900
稍有不同，但这是相同的想法，所以说11个是节点
slightly different but this for the same idea so let's say eleven is the node

1912
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:49,910
稍有不同，但这是相同的想法，所以说11个是节点
idea so let's say eleven is the node eleven is the root and we want to

1913
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:52,900
十一是根，我们要先计算一些消息下的
idea so let's say eleven is the node eleven is the root and we want to

1914
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:55,570
十一是根，我们要先计算一些消息下的
eleven is the root and we want to compute the under some messages first

1915
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:55,580
十一是根，我们要先计算一些消息下的
compute the under some messages first right and and then compute marginal and

1916
01:06:55,580 --> 01:07:01,180
对，然后计算边际和
compute the under some messages first right and and then compute marginal and

1917
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:01,380
实际上让我看看我们是否只想计算发生了什么
compute the under some messages first right and and then compute marginal and

1918
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:01,390
实际上让我看看我们是否只想计算发生了什么


1919
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:10,050
实际上让我看看我们是否只想计算发生了什么
actually let me see if we only want to compute what's going on okay well

1920
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:10,060
实际上让我看看我们是否只想计算发生了什么
compute what's going on okay well there is no particular node of interest

1921
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,820
没有感兴趣的特定节点，但我会告诉您这个特定的节点
compute what's going on okay well there is no particular node of interest

1922
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:14,490
没有感兴趣的特定节点，但我会告诉您这个特定的节点
there is no particular node of interest but I will tell you what this specific

1923
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:14,500
没有感兴趣的特定节点，但我会告诉您这个特定的节点
but I will tell you what this specific to this example right so let's say we

1924
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,770
对于这个示例，我们假设要计算这是根节点
but I will tell you what this specific to this example right so let's say we

1925
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:19,200
对于这个示例，我们假设要计算这是根节点
to this example right so let's say we want to compute this is the root node

1926
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:19,210
对于这个示例，我们假设要计算这是根节点
want to compute this is the root node right that we want to compute all the

1927
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:20,580
是的，我们要计算该图上的所有消息的第10个，所以我们
want to compute this is the root node right that we want to compute all the

1928
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:23,610
是的，我们要计算该图上的所有消息的第10个，所以我们
right that we want to compute all the message 10th on this graph so we're

1929
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:23,620
是的，我们要计算该图上的所有消息的第10个，所以我们
message 10th on this graph so we're going to do a first order elimination

1930
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:26,300
进行一阶消除可以听到有人为我拼写什么
message 10th on this graph so we're going to do a first order elimination

1931
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,130
进行一阶消除可以听到有人为我拼写什么
going to do a first order elimination can hear somebody spell for me what may

1932
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:29,140
进行一阶消除可以听到有人为我拼写什么
can hear somebody spell for me what may be a first order we'll look on this

1933
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,300
首先，我们将在此图上看到许多订单
can hear somebody spell for me what may be a first order we'll look on this

1934
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:35,610
首先，我们将在此图上看到许多订单
be a first order we'll look on this graph there are many orders of

1935
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:35,620
首先，我们将在此图上看到许多订单
graph there are many orders of eliminating nodes but here's the optimal

1936
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:37,620
消除节点，但这是最优的，是一阶，你还记得自己
graph there are many orders of eliminating nodes but here's the optimal

1937
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,720
消除节点，但这是最优的，是一阶，你还记得自己
eliminating nodes but here's the optimal is the first order and you remember you

1938
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:39,730
消除节点，但这是最优的，是一阶，你还记得自己
is the first order and you remember you start from the left tree and then from

1939
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:42,960
从左边的树开始，然后从左边到外面
is the first order and you remember you start from the left tree and then from

1940
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,650
从左边的树开始，然后从左边到外面
start from the left tree and then from the left side to outside so potentially

1941
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:46,660
从左边的树开始，然后从左边到外面
the left side to outside so potentially how the first order elimination will

1942
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:49,500
一阶消除的外观如何1 2 1 2 3 4
the left side to outside so potentially how the first order elimination will

1943
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:59,100
一阶消除的外观如何1 2 1 2 3 4
how the first order elimination will look here 1 2 1 2 3 4

1944
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,370
一二七
how the first order elimination will look here 1 2 1 2 3 4

1945

one two seven

1947
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:05,110
好吧，所以1毫米连续体Philip 7 8 9 5 6 10和11你还是没事的
one two seven

好吧，所以1毫米连续体Philip 7 8 9 5 6 10和11你还是没事的
alright so 1 mm continuum Philip 7 8 9 5 6 10 and 11 you still at ok

1950
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:23,149
如果您知道对您不利，但我建议您可以每周查看一次
alright so 1 mm continuum Philip 7 8 9 5 6 10 and 11 you still at ok

1951
01:08:23,149 --> 01:08:23,159
如果您知道对您不利，但我建议您可以每周查看一次


1952
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:26,870
如果您知道对您不利，但我建议您可以每周查看一次
if you know it offenders to you but I suggest is you can look at the weekly

1953
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:26,880
如果您知道对您不利，但我建议您可以每周查看一次
suggest is you can look at the weekly and Wikipedia you know there is five

1954
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,780
和Wikipedia，您知道有五种不同的订购类型，但
suggest is you can look at the weekly and Wikipedia you know there is five

1955
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:32,149
和Wikipedia，您知道有五种不同的订购类型，但
and Wikipedia you know there is five different types of ordering but the

1956
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:32,159
和Wikipedia，您知道有五种不同的订购类型，但
different types of ordering but the first one there is basically what is

1957
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:33,439
第一个基本上是用于消除三个底部的东西
different types of ordering but the first one there is basically what is

1958
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:36,740
第一个基本上是用于消除三个底部的东西
first one there is basically what is used for bottom elimination on three so

1959
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:36,750
第一个基本上是用于消除三个底部的东西
used for bottom elimination on three so this is what we need to use here

1960
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,180
这就是我们在这里需要使用的，我的意思是你还有别的
used for bottom elimination on three so this is what we need to use here

1961
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,910
这就是我们在这里需要使用的，我的意思是你还有别的
this is what we need to use here I mean you something else it's just

1962
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:40,920
这就是我们在这里需要使用的，我的意思是你还有别的
I mean you something else it's just assumed that part will be higher than

1963
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,519
假设该部分将比使用孔后高，所以如果您
I mean you something else it's just assumed that part will be higher than

1964
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:47,090
假设该部分将比使用孔后高，所以如果您
assumed that part will be higher than using a posthole okay so if you were

1965
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:47,100
假设该部分将比使用孔后高，所以如果您
using a posthole okay so if you were gonna do calculations basically

1966
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,669
基本上可以进行计算分析，好吧
using a posthole okay so if you were gonna do calculations basically

1967
01:08:48,669 --> 01:08:58,729
基本上可以进行计算分析，好吧
gonna do calculations basically analytically okay so alright the

1968
01:08:58,729 --> 01:08:58,739
基本上可以进行计算分析，好吧
analytically okay so alright the elimination and we're gonna start to

1969
01:08:58,739 --> 01:09:00,860
消除，我们将开始计算消息，好吗
analytically okay so alright the elimination and we're gonna start to

1970
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:03,680
消除，我们将开始计算消息，好吗
elimination and we're gonna start to calculate messages okay

1971
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:03,690
消除，我们将开始计算消息，好吗
calculate messages okay so I can calculate the message from node

1972
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:06,439
所以我可以计算从节点1到7的消息，这种计算对
calculate messages okay so I can calculate the message from node

1973
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:10,220
所以我可以计算从节点1到7的消息，这种计算对
so I can calculate the message from node 1 to 7 is this calculation make sense to

1974
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:10,230
所以我可以计算从节点1到7的消息，这种计算对
1 to 7 is this calculation make sense to you

1975
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:11,590
您没有到节点1的传入消息
1 to 7 is this calculation make sense to you

1976
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:14,329
您没有到节点1的传入消息
you there is no incoming message to node 1

1977
01:09:14,329 --> 01:09:14,339
您没有到节点1的传入消息
there is no incoming message to node 1 so this situation of the potential try 1

1978
01:09:14,339 --> 01:09:16,789
所以这种情况的潜在尝试1 7好的
there is no incoming message to node 1 so this situation of the potential try 1

1979
01:09:16,789 --> 01:09:19,579
所以这种情况的潜在尝试1 7好的
so this situation of the potential try 1 7 okay

1980
01:09:19,579 --> 01:09:19,589
所以这种情况的潜在尝试1 7好的
7 okay I can do a calculation of 2 to 7 at the

1981
01:09:19,589 --> 01:09:21,680
我可以同时进行2到7的计算，这是我可以做的
7 okay I can do a calculation of 2 to 7 at the

1982
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,740
我可以同时进行2到7的计算，这是我可以做的
I can do a calculation of 2 to 7 at the same time no problem this is I can do

1983
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:24,750
我可以同时进行2到7的计算，这是我可以做的
same time no problem this is I can do the calculation of 3 2 8 4 2 8 5 to 10 6

1984
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:31,820
3 2 8 4 2 8 5到10 6到10的计算没关系，所以我可以
same time no problem this is I can do the calculation of 3 2 8 4 2 8 5 to 10 6

1985
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:34,010
3 2 8 4 2 8 5到10 6到10的计算没关系，所以我可以
the calculation of 3 2 8 4 2 8 5 to 10 6 to 10 all right so I can do the

1986
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:34,020
3 2 8 4 2 8 5到10 6到10的计算没关系，所以我可以
to 10 all right so I can do the calculation the first 2 lines all

1987
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:35,870
同时在此图上计算前两行，所以现在我
to 10 all right so I can do the calculation the first 2 lines all

1988
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:40,490
同时在此图上计算前两行，所以现在我
calculation the first 2 lines all simultaneously on this graph so now I

1989
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:40,500
同时在此图上计算前两行，所以现在我
simultaneously on this graph so now I need to calculate the potential from I

1990
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,849
需要从我的意思是从7到9的消息中计算出电位，然后再次
simultaneously on this graph so now I need to calculate the potential from I

1991
01:09:43,849 --> 01:09:46,910
需要从我的意思是从7到9的消息中计算出电位，然后再次
need to calculate the potential from I mean the message from 7 to 9 and again

1992
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:46,920
需要从我的意思是从7到9的消息中计算出电位，然后再次
mean the message from 7 to 9 and again no equations are needed right so what

1993
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,189
不需要方程式，所以您需要做的就是找到所有消息
mean the message from 7 to 9 and again no equations are needed right so what

1994
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:52,220
不需要方程式，所以您需要做的就是找到所有消息
no equations are needed right so what you need to do is find all the messages

1995
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:52,230
不需要方程式，所以您需要做的就是找到所有消息
you need to do is find all the messages are coming to notes level multiplied

1996
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,560
即将达到的音符水平乘以7到9之间的电位，
you need to do is find all the messages are coming to notes level multiplied

1997
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,590
即将达到的音符水平乘以7到9之间的电位，
are coming to notes level multiplied with the potential between 7 and 9 and

1998
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:56,600
即将达到的音符水平乘以7到9之间的电位，
with the potential between 7 and 9 and get rid of 7 eliminate them

1999
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,240
摆脱7消除它们，所以基本上从7到9的消息是
with the potential between 7 and 9 and get rid of 7 eliminate them

2000
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,720
摆脱7消除它们，所以基本上从7到9的消息是
get rid of 7 eliminate them so basically the message from 7 to 9 is

2001
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:02,730
摆脱7消除它们，所以基本上从7到9的消息是
so basically the message from 7 to 9 is this potential 7 9 if you can of course

2002
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:06,890
这个潜在的7 9如果可以的话当然可以证明7可以，但是在
so basically the message from 7 to 9 is this potential 7 9 if you can of course

2003
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:10,220
这个潜在的7 9如果可以的话当然可以证明7可以，但是在
this potential 7 9 if you can of course the evidence for 7 you can but in also

2004
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:10,230
这个潜在的7 9如果可以的话当然可以证明7可以，但是在
the evidence for 7 you can but in also the message from 1 to 7 the message from

2005
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:12,919
从1到7的消息，从2到7的消息，所以很明显，这要求
the evidence for 7 you can but in also the message from 1 to 7 the message from

2006
01:10:12,919 --> 01:10:15,950
从1到7的消息，从2到7的消息，所以很明显，这要求
the message from 1 to 7 the message from 2 to 7 so obviously this requires that

2007
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:15,960
从1到7的消息，从2到7的消息，所以很明显，这要求
2 to 7 so obviously this requires that you already have done this calculation

2008
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:16,970
您已经以同样的方式完成了前20万的计算
2 to 7 so obviously this requires that you already have done this calculation

2009
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:20,090
您已经以同样的方式完成了前20万的计算
you already have done this calculation the first 2 lakhs similarly you can

2010
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:20,100
您已经以同样的方式完成了前20万的计算
the first 2 lakhs similarly you can calculate the message from 8 9 ok the

2011
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:24,020
从8 9确定两个消息的输入时间乘以
the first 2 lakhs similarly you can calculate the message from 8 9 ok the

2012
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,820
从8 9确定两个消息的输入时间乘以
calculate the message from 8 9 ok the two incoming messages times this

2013
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:25,830
从8 9确定两个消息的输入时间乘以
two incoming messages times this potential and then

2014
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:27,060
潜力，然后进行布局，然后让我们看看，然后
two incoming messages times this potential and then

2015
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:33,060
潜力，然后进行布局，然后让我们看看，然后
potential and then lay it out and then let's see and then

2016
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:33,070
潜力，然后进行布局，然后让我们看看，然后
lay it out and then let's see and then we need to calculate the message from

2017
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:34,589
我们需要计算从九点到十一点的信息
lay it out and then let's see and then we need to calculate the message from

2018
01:10:34,589 --> 01:10:35,490
我们需要计算从九点到十一点的信息
we need to calculate the message from nine to eleven

2019
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:35,500
我们需要计算从九点到十一点的信息
nine to eleven so this again nothing special the

2020
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:39,030
所以这又没有什么特别的九和十一课程的潜力
nine to eleven so this again nothing special the

2021
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:42,270
所以这又没有什么特别的九和十一课程的潜力
so this again nothing special the potential of nine and eleven course that

2022
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:42,280
所以这又没有什么特别的九和十一课程的潜力
potential of nine and eleven course that okay

2023
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,680
好吧，即将来临的先生。七十九岁
potential of nine and eleven course that okay

2024
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:45,990
好吧，即将来临的先生。七十九岁
okay the incoming mr. seventy-nine becoming

2025
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:46,000
好吧，即将来临的先生。七十九岁
the incoming mr. seventy-nine becoming less to eight to nine and then

2026
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,760
少到八到九，然后将x9集成出来，类似地
the incoming mr. seventy-nine becoming less to eight to nine and then

2027
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,580
少到八到九，然后将x9集成出来，类似地
less to eight to nine and then integrating x9 out and similarly the

2028
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:50,590
少到八到九，然后将x9集成出来，类似地
integrating x9 out and similarly the message compared to 11 so this time the

2029
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:53,910
邮件与11相比，所以这次邮件来自今天的列表
integrating x9 out and similarly the message compared to 11 so this time the

2030
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:58,100
邮件与11相比，所以这次邮件来自今天的列表
message compared to 11 so this time the message is coming from the list today

2031
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:58,110
邮件与11相比，所以这次邮件来自今天的列表
message is coming from the list today okay now let me try the worst sort of

2032
01:10:58,110 --> 01:11:05,870
好吧，现在让我尝试最糟糕的基本方法来完成此操作
message is coming from the list today okay now let me try the worst sort of

2033
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:09,240
好吧，现在让我尝试最糟糕的基本方法来完成此操作
okay now let me try the worst sort of elementary way of completing this

2034
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:09,250
好吧，现在让我尝试最糟糕的基本方法来完成此操作
elementary way of completing this message from nine to eleven right so

2035
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:12,030
从9点到11点的信息，所以基本上我要在一个
elementary way of completing this message from nine to eleven right so

2036
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:16,290
从9点到11点的信息，所以基本上我要在一个
message from nine to eleven right so basically I'm going to solve this in a

2037
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:16,300
从9点到11点的信息，所以基本上我要在一个
basically I'm going to solve this in a different mathematical form so you can

2154
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:49,119
好的-从11到9派了一个大师，什么时候什么协议可以


2155
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:56,850
好的-从11到9派了一个大师，什么时候什么协议可以
okay - sent a masters from 11 to 9 what does not what is the protocol when can

2156
01:14:56,850 --> 01:14:56,860
好的-从11到9派了一个大师，什么时候什么协议可以
does not what is the protocol when can 11 send the message to genomic when it

2157
01:14:56,860 --> 01:15:01,169
11仅从其接收到所有消息时，将消息发送到基因组
does not what is the protocol when can 11 send the message to genomic when it

2158
01:15:01,169 --> 01:15:04,859
11仅从其接收到所有消息时，将消息发送到基因组
11 send the message to genomic when it only has received all messages from its

2159
01:15:04,859 --> 01:15:04,869
11仅从其接收到所有消息时，将消息发送到基因组
only has received all messages from its neighbors and the neighbors here except

2160
01:15:04,869 --> 01:15:07,770
邻居和这里的邻居，除了9之外没有10很好，所以11会发送一个
only has received all messages from its neighbors and the neighbors here except

2161
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:15,180
邻居和这里的邻居，除了9之外没有10很好，所以11会发送一个
neighbors and the neighbors here except 9 is no 10 alright so for 11 to send a

2162
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:15,190
邻居和这里的邻居，除了9之外没有10很好，所以11会发送一个
9 is no 10 alright so for 11 to send a message to 911 history see the rest is

2163
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:18,089
信息到911历史，看到其余的是10起，他需要没有发布信息
9 is no 10 alright so for 11 to send a message to 911 history see the rest is

2164
01:15:18,089 --> 01:15:20,580
信息到911历史，看到其余的是10起，他需要没有发布信息
message to 911 history see the rest is from 10 he needs to have no post message

2165
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:20,590
信息到911历史，看到其余的是10起，他需要没有发布信息
from 10 he needs to have no post message on here all right obviously captain

2166
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:24,359
在这里好吧，显然是图片中的船长，但是错过了
from 10 he needs to have no post message on here all right obviously captain

2167
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:25,620
在这里好吧，显然是图片中的船长，但是错过了
on here all right obviously captain based in the picture but missed the

2168
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:25,630
在这里好吧，显然是图片中的船长，但是错过了
based in the picture but missed the message that pen sends to you ever all

2169
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:30,120
笔向您发送的消息没事，所以基本上来自11的消息
based in the picture but missed the message that pen sends to you ever all

2170
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,790
笔向您发送的消息没事，所以基本上来自11的消息
message that pen sends to you ever all right so basically the message from 11

2171
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:32,800
笔向您发送的消息没事，所以基本上来自11的消息
right so basically the message from 11 to 9 is this potential with the message

2172
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:38,129
到9是这种潜力，消息从10到11，然后是节点11
right so basically the message from 11 to 9 is this potential with the message

2173
01:15:38,129 --> 01:15:41,280
到9是这种潜力，消息从10到11，然后是节点11
to 9 is this potential with the message coming from 10 to 11 and then node 11

2174
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:41,290
到9是这种潜力，消息从10到11，然后是节点11
coming from 10 to 11 and then node 11 eliminate similarly if you want to

2175
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:46,050
如果要计算承租人11美分到10的费用，则消除类似
coming from 10 to 11 and then node 11 eliminate similarly if you want to

2176
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:48,450
如果要计算承租人11美分到10的费用，则消除类似
eliminate similarly if you want to compute the lessees 11 cents to 10 would

2177
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:48,460
如果要计算承租人11美分到10的费用，则消除类似
compute the lessees 11 cents to 10 would be the potential of 11 and 10 and the

2178
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,370
是11和10的潜力，以及来自9-11等信息，等等
compute the lessees 11 cents to 10 would be the potential of 11 and 10 and the

2179
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:56,639
是11和10的潜力，以及来自9-11等信息，等等
be the potential of 11 and 10 and the message coming from 9-11 etc etc okay

2180
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:59,310
所以呈现的奥秘，基本上，如果你想说一个物理的
be the potential of 11 and 10 and the message coming from 9-11 etc etc okay

2181
01:15:59,310 --> 01:15:59,320
所以呈现的奥秘，基本上，如果你想说一个物理的


2182
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:05,970
所以呈现的奥秘，基本上，如果你想说一个物理的
so the mystery of presenting and so basically if you want to say a physical

2183
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:05,980
所以呈现的奥秘，基本上，如果你想说一个物理的
basically if you want to say a physical sort of interpretation of the

2184
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,859
我们对发送消息所做的计算的某种解释
basically if you want to say a physical sort of interpretation of the

2185
01:16:07,859 --> 01:16:10,169
我们对发送消息所做的计算的某种解释
sort of interpretation of the calculation we did for sending a message

2186
01:16:10,169 --> 01:16:10,179
我们对发送消息所做的计算的某种解释
calculation we did for sending a message 11 from 11 to 9 effectively what you can

2187
01:16:10,179 --> 01:16:15,510
从11到9的11实际上，如果您看对了，您可以想象的是
calculation we did for sending a message 11 from 11 to 9 effectively what you can

2188
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:17,580
从11到9的11实际上，如果您看对了，您可以想象的是
11 from 11 to 9 effectively what you can envision is if you look at the right

2189
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:17,590
从11到9的11实际上，如果您看对了，您可以想象的是
envision is if you look at the right subtree right the subtree basically that

2190
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:22,410
子树基本上是当您消除X 9到11时得到的子树
envision is if you look at the right subtree right the subtree basically that

2191
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:25,919
子树基本上是当您消除X 9到11时得到的子树
subtree right the subtree basically that you get when you eliminate the X 9 to 11

2192
01:16:25,919 --> 01:16:25,929
子树基本上是当您消除X 9到11时得到的子树
you get when you eliminate the X 9 to 11 all right and then you do elimination of

2193
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:28,500
好，然后您消除子树中的所有节点，然后
you get when you eliminate the X 9 to 11 all right and then you do elimination of

2194
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:31,290
好，然后您消除子树中的所有节点，然后
all right and then you do elimination of all the nodes in the subtree okay and

2195
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:31,300
好，然后您消除子树中的所有节点，然后
all the nodes in the subtree okay and that means you some on 5 to 10 and 11 of

2196
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:35,339
这意味着您可能会在5至10和11的电势中
all the nodes in the subtree okay and that means you some on 5 to 10 and 11 of

2197
01:16:35,339 --> 01:16:37,620
这意味着您可能会在5至10和11的电势中
that means you some on 5 to 10 and 11 of the potentials corresponding to this

2198
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:37,630
这意味着您可能会在5至10和11的电势中
the potentials corresponding to this subject okay so if you do this basically

2199
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:41,100
主题很好，所以如果您基本上这样做，您将获得的是
the potentials corresponding to this subject okay so if you do this basically

2200
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,800
主题很好，所以如果您基本上这样做，您将获得的是
subject okay so if you do this basically what you will get is you will get this

2201
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:43,810
主题很好，所以如果您基本上这样做，您将获得的是
what you will get is you will get this calculation at the end of the day okay

2202
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:45,839
在一天结束时进行计算还可以，但是显然，这为您提供了一种方法
what you will get is you will get this calculation at the end of the day okay

2203
01:16:45,839 --> 01:16:47,939
在一天结束时进行计算还可以，但是显然，这为您提供了一种方法
calculation at the end of the day okay but obviously this gives you a way to

2204
01:16:47,939 --> 01:16:47,949
在一天结束时进行计算还可以，但是显然，这为您提供了一种方法
but obviously this gives you a way to remember so I don't have time to finish

2205
01:16:47,949 --> 01:16:53,520
记住，所以我没有时间完成这145，但是我建议看一下
but obviously this gives you a way to remember so I don't have time to finish

2206
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,209
记住，所以我没有时间完成这145，但是我建议看一下
remember so I don't have time to finish this 145 but what I suggest this look at

2207
01:16:57,209 --> 01:16:57,219
记住，所以我没有时间完成这145，但是我建议看一下
this 145 but what I suggest this look at the algorithm because there is a stream

2208
01:16:57,219 --> 01:16:59,879
该算法，因为有一个流和局部同上的复杂
this 145 but what I suggest this look at the algorithm because there is a stream

2209
01:16:59,879 --> 01:17:03,240
该算法，因为有一个流和局部同上的复杂
the algorithm because there is a stream and the local ibid sort of complicated

2210
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:03,250
该算法，因为有一个流和局部同上的复杂
and the local ibid sort of complicated so the algorithm for setting the

2211
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:04,830
因此，用于设置后继订单的算法总是非常先进的
and the local ibid sort of complicated so the algorithm for setting the

2212
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:07,459
因此，用于设置后继订单的算法总是非常先进的
so the algorithm for setting the postorder it's very progressive always

2213
01:17:07,459 --> 01:17:07,469
因此，用于设置后继订单的算法总是非常先进的
postorder it's very progressive always 25 lines okay and it does this correctly

2214
01:17:07,469 --> 01:17:11,100
25行就可以了，它正确执行了，算法的总和将
postorder it's very progressive always 25 lines okay and it does this correctly

2215
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:15,930
25行就可以了，它正确执行了，算法的总和将
25 lines okay and it does this correctly okay and the sum for the algorithms will

2216
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:15,940
25行就可以了，它正确执行了，算法的总和将
okay and the sum for the algorithms will describe this basically little

2217
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:18,089
描述这个与消除算法基本上没有什么区别
okay and the sum for the algorithms will describe this basically little

2218
01:17:18,089 --> 01:17:22,500
描述这个与消除算法基本上没有什么区别
describe this basically little difference from elimination algorithm

2219
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:22,510
描述这个与消除算法基本上没有什么区别
difference from elimination algorithm and it is the custom in there in nature

2220
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:25,229
这是自然界中的习惯，例如在收集消息之前
difference from elimination algorithm and it is the custom in there in nature

2221
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:28,020
这是自然界中的习惯，例如在收集消息之前
and it is the custom in there in nature for example collecting messages before

2222
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:28,030
这是自然界中的习惯，例如在收集消息之前
for example collecting messages before you are ready to propagate it's a

2223
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:29,970
您准备好传播它是一个递归算法，甚至是树
for example collecting messages before you are ready to propagate it's a

2224
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:31,879
您准备好传播它是一个递归算法，甚至是树
you are ready to propagate it's a recursive algorithm even tree

2225
01:17:31,879 --> 01:17:31,889
您准备好传播它是一个递归算法，甚至是树
recursive algorithm even tree distributing message from a node to the

2226
01:17:31,889 --> 01:17:34,020
从节点到腿部举动的消息传递也是一种递归算法

so I'm really like you know you guys to make an attempt to at least program

2231
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:42,670
所以我真的很想你知道你们尝试至少编程
make an attempt to at least program something that involves inference on

2232

2234
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:47,310
涉及扭曲推断的东西，因为你们都在前进
twist because sort of an is y'all going okay so and as I mentioned those who are

2235
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:52,200
好的，正如我提到的，如果您不是真的在审核课程，
twist because sort of an is y'all going okay so and as I mentioned those who are

01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,729
好的，正如我提到的，如果您不是真的在审核课程，
okay so and as I mentioned those who are auditing the course if you don't really

2237
01:17:53,729 --> 01:17:53,739
好的，正如我提到的，如果您不是真的在审核课程，
auditing the course if you don't really program these things there is no way

2238
01:17:53,739 --> 01:17:55,890
对这些东西进行编程实际上是没有办法的
auditing the course if you don't really program these things there is no way

对这些东西进行编程实际上是没有办法的
program these things there is no way actually

2240
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:56,440
对这些东西进行编程实际上是没有办法的
actually you'll never figure out how this thing

2241
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,110
你永远不会弄清楚这东西现在是如何工作的，如果
actually you'll never figure out how this thing
