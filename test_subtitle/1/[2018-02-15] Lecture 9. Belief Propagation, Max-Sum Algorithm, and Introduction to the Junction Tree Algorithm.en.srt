1
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:04,559
all right so tomorrow we're gonna have a recitation related homework three and I

2
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,240
recitation related homework three and I suppose we'll achieve our homework two

3
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,270
suppose we'll achieve our homework two already when it was due today one last

4
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,670
already when it was due today one last time okay all right let's post it all

5
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,599
time okay all right let's post it all right because I offer an extension and

6
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,369
right because I offer an extension and all would be no more extension so that

7
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:22,649
all would be no more extension so that now when I saw their Bailey station

8
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:24,149
now when I saw their Bailey station regarding homework three and one of the

9
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:28,129
regarding homework three and one of the things we haven't discussed this about

10
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:31,080
things we haven't discussed this about projects for the class okay because you

11
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,509
projects for the class okay because you stopped working so you don't go the last

12
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:36,229
stopped working so you don't go the last week and you say to me my project is

13
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:38,360
week and you say to me my project is literally three days before the

14
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,530
literally three days before the presentations okay

15
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,420
presentations okay because then I'd really get mad and not

16
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,369
because then I'd really get mad and not think if in some sense you don't feel

17
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:49,649
think if in some sense you don't feel the need to have a broader it's good

18
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:50,849
the need to have a broader it's good thing to know so I can give more

19
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:53,879
thing to know so I can give more homework right that means one or the

20
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,180
homework right that means one or the other so projects are good for you

21
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,530
other so projects are good for you because it gives you an opportunity to

22
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,439
because it gives you an opportunity to integrate things with your research and

23
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:04,439
integrate things with your research and learn something new and I want simple

24
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,270
learn something new and I want simple projects for that way you know in other

25
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,670
projects for that way you know in other ways if you take a paper from the

26
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,479
ways if you take a paper from the literature in this area and you

27
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,309
literature in this area and you implement what it says the application

28
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:16,610
implement what it says the application examples of fantastic that's a project

29
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,009
examples of fantastic that's a project something we haven't discussed about so

30
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,629
something we haven't discussed about so that way when you give a presentation to

31
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,339
that way when you give a presentation to the class the class learn something new

32
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:26,640
the class the class learn something new and we have the whole idea so it's not a

33
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,500
and we have the whole idea so it's not a way to do nothing and then pretend

34
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,439
way to do nothing and then pretend here's my project okay that's not very

35
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,529
here's my project okay that's not very good for yourself for me and for the

36
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:37,800
good for yourself for me and for the university all right

37
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,120
university all right still may I suggest that we thin like to

38
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,220
still may I suggest that we thin like to the next week we'll talk you come up

39
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,870
the next week we'll talk you come up with an applet for your project okay and

40
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,640
with an applet for your project okay and this time you won't be able to change it

41
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,000
this time you won't be able to change it so make your abstract artwork with at

42
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,620
so make your abstract artwork with at least one reference so I know that

43
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,270
least one reference so I know that you're bounded by something okay you

44
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:15,770
you're bounded by something okay you miss the most important or the clause

45
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:15,780


46
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:22,140
and you know there were a few more slides left on the last lecture but is

47
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,360
slides left on the last lecture but is now posted because I realized we forgot

48
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,030
now posted because I realized we forgot to post it the same way we forgot to

49
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:33,360
to post it the same way we forgot to post the videos all right take note so

50
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,000
post the videos all right take note so we need to read this posted so today I'm

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,370
we need to read this posted so today I'm going to do is I'm going to move past

52
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,450
going to do is I'm going to move past the sum-product algorithm and discussed

53
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,210
the sum-product algorithm and discussed first the Maxum algorithm and we

54
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,300
first the Maxum algorithm and we discussed what that is in sort of very

55
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,390
discussed what that is in sort of very general terms then we'll actually take a

56
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,250
general terms then we'll actually take a step backwards if nothing else for

57
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,070
step backwards if nothing else for historical reasons and give you a few

58
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,130
historical reasons and give you a few slides on something that the sample of a

59
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,510
slides on something that the sample of a subtype of the sum-product I will be

60
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,440
subtype of the sum-product I will be photographed

61
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,680
photographed that is called belief propagation and at

62
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,690
that is called belief propagation and at least you need to know when you see a

63
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,400
least you need to know when you see a need because people talk about belief

64
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,980
need because people talk about belief propagation it's basically a subset of

65
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,469
propagation it's basically a subset of what we already have done but I want to

66
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:18,950
what we already have done but I want to just cover it a few slides so you see

67
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:24,330
just cover it a few slides so you see the notation coming from people that are

68
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,430
the notation coming from people that are grounded in information science is sort

69
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,560
grounded in information science is sort of a different perspective of what we

70
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,850
of a different perspective of what we have done up to now

71
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,360
have done up to now and assuming we have Pauline I'm gonna

72
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,420
and assuming we have Pauline I'm gonna start to discuss another exact inference

73
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,190
start to discuss another exact inference algorithm for general graphs which is

74
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,440
algorithm for general graphs which is called the junction tree algorithm I am

75
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,370
called the junction tree algorithm I am NOT going to give you all the details

76
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,280
NOT going to give you all the details some sort of simple examples and then

77
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,590
some sort of simple examples and then when we come back on Tuesday I will

78
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,260
when we come back on Tuesday I will provide some of the details from the

79
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,940
provide some of the details from the different versions of this algorithms

80
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,240
different versions of this algorithms and hopefully you can do one of these

81
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,650
and hopefully you can do one of these implementations in your homework once we

82
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,600
implementations in your homework once we cover these things or maybe the next

83
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,360
cover these things or maybe the next several lectures we're going to go

84
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,120
several lectures we're going to go backwards and do examples for example

85
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,780
backwards and do examples for example for hidden Markov models for state-space

86
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,680
for hidden Markov models for state-space models so we are going to try to revisit

87
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,120
models so we are going to try to revisit this knowledge in specific contexts so

88
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,030
this knowledge in specific contexts so in some sense you have another mark for

89
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,530
in some sense you have another mark for short the good luck to these notes and

90
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,400
short the good luck to these notes and read them again

91
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,680
read them again okay because we will release them on

92
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,710
okay because we will release them on specific examples so let me introduce

93
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,280
specific examples so let me introduce this magical algorithm when what the

94
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,950
this magical algorithm when what the problem is about so obviously in

95
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,940
problem is about so obviously in probabilistic graphical models we can

96
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,610
probabilistic graphical models we can model the joint probability distribution

97
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,900
model the joint probability distribution of many of the variables and we figure

98
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,420
of many of the variables and we figure out how given some evidence we compute

99
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,430
out how given some evidence we compute conditionals to marginal stuffing size

100
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,400
conditionals to marginal stuffing size up so right now let's say we have a

101
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,640
up so right now let's say we have a graph to represent a probability P of X

102
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,210
graph to represent a probability P of X and we want to find the value the

103
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,580
and we want to find the value the maximum effects that maximizes this P of

104
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,800
maximum effects that maximizes this P of X and also that maximum value of P of X

105
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,240
X and also that maximum value of P of X so if you think that P of X being the

106
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,000
so if you think that P of X being the prosperity Oracle may be asking what's

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,590
prosperity Oracle may be asking what's the value of x of Knox why is the

108
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,650
the value of x of Knox why is the posterior and what is not maximum value

109
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,300
posterior and what is not maximum value okay so the difficulty with this problem

110
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,890
okay so the difficulty with this problem right is that if you maximize marginals

111
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,470
right is that if you maximize marginals what you will get if you put all the XS

112
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,900
what you will get if you put all the XS together is not the same axis as we must

113
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,139
together is not the same axis as we must mies the

114
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,809
mies the the Joint Distribution and carry sort of

115
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,889
the Joint Distribution and carry sort of a trivial example we have binary

116
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:43,559
a trivial example we have binary particle section Y lists are the

117
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,720
particle section Y lists are the corresponding probabilities for these

118
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,079
corresponding probabilities for these items to take the value stone you can

119
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:51,030
items to take the value stone you can see the value of the probability of X

120
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,300
see the value of the probability of X equal to 0.6 the probability of X equal

121
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,280
equal to 0.6 the probability of X equal ones points y equal to 0.7 and why port

122
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,509
ones points y equal to 0.7 and why port 1 is 43 so X the argument affects that

123
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,220
1 is 43 so X the argument affects that takes gives you the maximum probability

124
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,119
takes gives you the maximum probability for the marginal is X equal to 0 right

125
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,809
for the marginal is X equal to 0 right we're doing and the maximum the kind of

126
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:16,920
we're doing and the maximum the kind of Y that much mice the marginal of Y is y

127
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,639
Y that much mice the marginal of Y is y equal to 0 but if you look at this table

128
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,119
equal to 0 but if you look at this table the this is basically the joint

129
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:26,579
the this is basically the joint probability distribution affection y the

130
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,530
probability distribution affection y the maximum happens when x equals 1 and y

131
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,720
maximum happens when x equals 1 and y equal to 0 not the same bar right so I

132
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,490
equal to 0 not the same bar right so I mean this is one example but you can

133
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,929
mean this is one example but you can generalize this and you can see that you

134
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:43,110
generalize this and you can see that you know you have to be very lucky where the

135
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,299
know you have to be very lucky where the axis of maximize the margin of the chain

136
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,139
axis of maximize the margin of the chain as the axis of maximize the the joint so

137
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:54,569
as the axis of maximize the the joint so what we need to do is we need to find an

138
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:58,319
what we need to do is we need to find an algorithm that we can do this with the

139
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:00,090
algorithm that we can do this with the same efficiency of doing influencing

140
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:05,100
same efficiency of doing influencing graphs or you can have algorithm and in

141
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,379
graphs or you can have algorithm and in principle looks identical to doing

142
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:10,170
principle looks identical to doing inference in graphs all right - some

143
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:15,120
inference in graphs all right - some small perturbations

144
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,130


145
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:20,230
you know I have mentioned that the lots of 12s algorithms really they they're

146
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,810
of 12s algorithms really they they're very common in you know in dynamic

147
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,070
very common in you know in dynamic programming source of all things you

148
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,770
programming source of all things you today they will also look like dynamic

149
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:31,000
today they will also look like dynamic programming so let's say this whole of

150
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,690
programming so let's say this whole of this tower evidence node this is a bunch

151
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,250
this tower evidence node this is a bunch of nodes we don't really care and this

152
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,350
of nodes we don't really care and this list the query nodes all right so we're

153
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,900
list the query nodes all right so we're interested to compute when we did

154
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,520
interested to compute when we did increase to compute the probability of X

155
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,280
increase to compute the probability of X F given XT and the whole idea of the

156
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,140
F given XT and the whole idea of the sum-product algorithm is to do sort of

157
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,900
sum-product algorithm is to do sort of estimations in an efficient way on the

158
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,670
estimations in an efficient way on the glass so now we want to find react but

159
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,540
glass so now we want to find react but maximize is this the probability except

160
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,820
maximize is this the probability except given the evidence which is basically

161
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,040
given the evidence which is basically the same as the probability maximizing

162
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,470
the same as the probability maximizing the joint because you know if you write

163
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,690
the joint because you know if you write is the joint divided by the evidence the

164
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,300
is the joint divided by the evidence the evidence doesn't accept so this is the

165
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,980
evidence doesn't accept so this is the same so effectively this light stays in

166
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,590
same so effectively this light stays in evidence or not doesn't matter you can

167
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,140
evidence or not doesn't matter you can treat the problem of finding the extras

168
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,790
treat the problem of finding the extras maximizes the joint all this probability

169
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,800
maximizes the joint all this probability for evidence account is basically the

170
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,250
for evidence account is basically the same way all right so in this case I

171
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,700
same way all right so in this case I mean you can put the extreme to the

172
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,140
mean you can put the extreme to the given value stand still you have the

173
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,570
given value stand still you have the joint distribution and maximize it with

174
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,660
joint distribution and maximize it with respect to itself right

175
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,290
respect to itself right now the religion that we will be able to

176
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,030
now the religion that we will be able to expand the inference algorithms to do

177
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:02,610
expand the inference algorithms to do this marks algorithm has the part of the

178
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,710
this marks algorithm has the part of the operator marks distribute over

179
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,880
operator marks distribute over multiplication the same way we show you

180
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,290
multiplication the same way we show you know with the summation when we did

181
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,770
know with the summation when we did inference algorithms so for example this

182
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,050
inference algorithms so for example this is what we took advantage to push

183
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,320
is what we took advantage to push summations in worlds you know when we

184
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,130
summations in worlds you know when we did elimination algorithms and you can

185
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,990
did elimination algorithms and you can see the same thing is applicable when we

186
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,500
see the same thing is applicable when we have maximization so the maximum a V and

187
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,710
have maximization so the maximum a V and H 3 is the same as a times the maximum

188
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:40,650
H 3 is the same as a times the maximum BC and and this distribution of the

189
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,360
BC and and this distribution of the match operator of a multiplication will

190
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,660
match operator of a multiplication will allow us to discipline the same sort of

191
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,790
allow us to discipline the same sort of idea that we did with elimination when

192
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,970
idea that we did with elimination when we were pushing salacious treatments so

193
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,280
we were pushing salacious treatments so we can be met let's algebra I'm doing

194
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,200
we can be met let's algebra I'm doing all of them simultaneously so if you

195
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,450
all of them simultaneously so if you have let's say stopped realization that

196
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,050
have let's say stopped realization that involves X 1 X 2 X 3 functions of the

197
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,110
involves X 1 X 2 X 3 functions of the three and you want to find the X 1 X 2 X

198
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,450
three and you want to find the X 1 X 2 X 3 that maximize this product obviously

199
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,700
3 that maximize this product obviously you can start pushing some of the much

200
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,710
you can start pushing some of the much of the latest in works I mean in this

201
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:16,500
of the latest in works I mean in this case of course it is trivial because 8 I

202
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,560
case of course it is trivial because 8 I do not put any x1 or x2 here then it

203
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,200
do not put any x1 or x2 here then it with anything else here so but obviously

204
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,760
with anything else here so but obviously you've got the spirit that somehow we

205
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,470
you've got the spirit that somehow we will be able to push this portal ok so

206
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,040
will be able to push this portal ok so here is the simple chain problem that we

207
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,050
here is the simple chain problem that we have seen everywhere undirected graph

208
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,970
have seen everywhere undirected graph let's say we define this these are the

209
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,250
let's say we define this these are the maximal cliques so we define this with a

210
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,390
maximal cliques so we define this with a potential so I want to try to 3 psi n

211
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,870
potential so I want to try to 3 psi n minus 1 n so if you want find the X of

212
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,170
minus 1 n so if you want find the X of maximizes first so effectively what you

213
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,450
maximizes first so effectively what you need to do is arrive this maximization

214
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,310
need to do is arrive this maximization of

215
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,660
of Racing on the way that you see on the

216
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:04,160
Racing on the way that you see on the bottom okay this is gonna be sort of the

217
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,009
bottom okay this is gonna be sort of the little complexity but we need to be able

218
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:10,040
little complexity but we need to be able to account for so here we are going x10

219
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,629
to account for so here we are going x10 appears on your list tab so you can

220
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:14,569
appears on your list tab so you can actually do this maximization then you

221
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:16,100
actually do this maximization then you will get something that depends only on

222
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,430
will get something that depends only on n minus 1 so this combined with the

223
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,809
n minus 1 so this combined with the previous potential you can do the

224
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:25,939
previous potential you can do the maximization or n minus 1 etc etc until

225
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:28,040
maximization or n minus 1 etc etc until basically you can do a maximization here

226
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:34,309
basically you can do a maximization here with respect to x1 actually if you

227
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:37,490
with respect to x1 actually if you understand this this example you

228
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,730
understand this this example you understand everything in the picture for

229
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,090
understand everything in the picture for this maximum algorithm and this

230
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,160
this maximum algorithm and this elimination algorithm and actually I

231
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,009
elimination algorithm and actually I copied the plot from one of our earlier

232
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:52,309
copied the plot from one of our earlier lectures where we were eliminating first

233
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:57,470
lectures where we were eliminating first X 6 and X 5 X 4 X 3 X 2 and X 1 so in

234
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,370
X 6 and X 5 X 4 X 3 X 2 and X 1 so in this case we want to find the maximum

235
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:06,230
this case we want to find the maximum that the joint probability of X 1 to 6

236
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,610
that the joint probability of X 1 to 6 but I take here vertex tricks is evident

237
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,250
but I take here vertex tricks is evident and as we said before it doesn't really

238
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,329
and as we said before it doesn't really make any difference

239
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:21,730
make any difference ok so this is the exact authorization

240
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,220
ok so this is the exact authorization nothing special again be FX 1 X 2 given

241
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,750
nothing special again be FX 1 X 2 given X 1 X 3 X 1 X 5 X 3 X 6 given X 2 and X

242
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:37,100
X 1 X 3 X 1 X 5 X 3 X 6 given X 2 and X 5 X 4 given X X 4 given X 2 X 4 X 4

243
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,150
5 X 4 given X X 4 given X 2 X 4 X 4 given a key to okay

244
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,579
given a key to okay and then I put Delta and evidence

245
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:43,189
and then I put Delta and evidence potential there to fix the value of x 6

246
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:46,319
potential there to fix the value of x 6 of X 6 bar

247
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:46,329


248
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:51,639
so we is compressing the maximization same words

249
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,449
same words so we suppress what parents involve sex

250
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:58,300
so we suppress what parents involve sex sticks and there is list times this

251
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,329
sticks and there is list times this potential but the only things that

252
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:04,660
potential but the only things that involve six six so we can actually find

253
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,670
involve six six so we can actually find the max2 of this with respect to its

254
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,750
the max2 of this with respect to its sixth when we say we're going to find an

255
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,759
sixth when we say we're going to find an option of this with respect to the sixth

256
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,710
option of this with respect to the sixth vistors for possible values of x 2 x 5

257
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,870
vistors for possible values of x 2 x 5 because in office in a function x 10 x 5

258
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,750
because in office in a function x 10 x 5 arguments then that given right so i

259
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,819
arguments then that given right so i mean this time a function of the three

260
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,620
mean this time a function of the three arguments okay

261
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,750
arguments okay so X 3 X 5 arbitrary here so when we

262
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,210
so X 3 X 5 arbitrary here so when we must merge with respect to X 6 we have

263
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,030
must merge with respect to X 6 we have to do for the possible values of X 3 X 5

264
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:47,380
to do for the possible values of X 3 X 5 this is very important move on okay you

265
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,829
this is very important move on okay you do this maximization and the same way we

266
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:52,780
do this maximization and the same way we did with elimination we're going to call

267
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,290
did with elimination we're going to call this 8 6 because 6 is the now to

268
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:03,220
this 8 6 because 6 is the now to eliminate and the arguments are so

269
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,730
eliminate and the arguments are so you're going to have to compute this

270
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,409
you're going to have to compute this expected shakes anyway call it the

271
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:13,750
expected shakes anyway call it the function HX X to connect start we did

272
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,939
function HX X to connect start we did the same thing with elimination but in

273
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:23,610
the same thing with elimination but in elimination what did we go to add 6

274
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:23,620


275
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:30,260
so to sum it all right if we must analyze it here we don't stop we must

276
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:37,019
analyze it here we don't stop we must okay the terms that involve x5 obviously

277
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:38,549
okay the terms that involve x5 obviously there was this term from the original

278
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:41,100
there was this term from the original distribution times this new potentially

279
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,490
distribution times this new potentially six so again the three arguments here

280
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,380
six so again the three arguments here are three and few so that we will get a

281
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,720
are three and few so that we will get a new function that is called H five

282
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,730
new function that is called H five because five is eliminated affects to

283
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,890
because five is eliminated affects to combine three then we need to eliminate

284
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,149
combine three then we need to eliminate on with much margin export this function

285
00:17:57,149 --> 00:18:00,720
on with much margin export this function would be let's see we need what we said

286
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,720
would be let's see we need what we said to do it on Expo right so this function

287
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,190
to do it on Expo right so this function well playing it all attorney this blue

288
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,889
well playing it all attorney this blue thing that you see here all right so

289
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,870
thing that you see here all right so this would be a function of X to only

290
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,680
this would be a function of X to only which is H porn effective then we need

291
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,240
which is H porn effective then we need to much my selects three which will

292
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,210
to much my selects three which will involve this argument last this function

293
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:27,149
involve this argument last this function H five this is what you see here this is

294
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:31,139
H five this is what you see here this is a three of x1 and x2 then we need to

295
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:33,510
a three of x1 and x2 then we need to maximize on x2 everything that has X Q

296
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:37,049
maximize on x2 everything that has X Q which is this x dot time to the stage

297
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,380
which is this x dot time to the stage three we call this function a to x one

298
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,990
three we call this function a to x one and then we're vision because we only

299
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,909
and then we're vision because we only have a function of x1 we can maximize it

300
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:49,200
have a function of x1 we can maximize it and that will give me you know will give

301
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,659
and that will give me you know will give you something a value and that's the

302
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:58,320
you something a value and that's the maximum of this probability okay so for

303
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,860
maximum of this probability okay so for many ways

304
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:02,870


305
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:12,360
there is nothing very different from the elimination algorithm okay

306
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:12,370


307
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:19,539
there is something this process here doesn't say anything about so we

308
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:25,529
doesn't say anything about so we computed the maximum of this probability

309
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:25,539


310
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:32,049
distribution of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 that maximize that joint probability what are

311
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:38,139
maximize that joint probability what are you going to tell you so this calculated

312
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:41,109
you going to tell you so this calculated the maxim of the joint and now I am

313
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:43,419
the maxim of the joint and now I am asking you what is what are the values

314
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:48,940
asking you what is what are the values of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 but together they

315
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,249
of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 but together they maximize this distribution so I want you

316
00:19:54,249 --> 00:19:56,409
maximize this distribution so I want you to look in the big areas there and try

317
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:58,899
to look in the big areas there and try to think what everything is going to be

318
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:01,119
to think what everything is going to be that you will see 10 slides from now and

319
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,060
that you will see 10 slides from now and you will look more confusing in verse 10

320
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,190
you will look more confusing in verse 10 slides down the road unless you actually

321
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,200
slides down the road unless you actually understand here how you're going to do

322
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:15,520
understand here how you're going to do it here

323
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:15,530


324
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:20,090
in this case right we let me make it safe from the leaves on the way to the

325
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,450
safe from the leaves on the way to the root so let's call this thing okay can

326
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,220
root so let's call this thing okay can do anything you want but the way we have

327
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,140
do anything you want but the way we have done it in this elimination sequence X 1

328
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,580
done it in this elimination sequence X 1 is the root so that's one that maximizes

329
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:38,990
is the root so that's one that maximizes this distribution the giant do we know

330
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,610
this distribution the giant do we know the prefix rock that much much

331
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,940
the prefix rock that much much distribution notice what in the last

332
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,000
distribution notice what in the last pair this problem right has only one

333
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,799
pair this problem right has only one argument here which sexual so do we know

334
00:20:51,799 --> 00:21:01,340
argument here which sexual so do we know x1 can we compute X 1 yes this how are

335
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:08,870
x1 can we compute X 1 yes this how are you going to compute X 2 in this

336
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,540
you going to compute X 2 in this calculation to allow you to compute now

337
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,020
calculation to allow you to compute now the value of x do you remember when we

338
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,120
the value of x do you remember when we computed this when we perform this

339
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,330
computed this when we perform this maximization so what values of x1 we did

340
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:27,500
maximization so what values of x1 we did it for what value of x 1 did we do this

341
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,520
it for what value of x 1 did we do this maximization with spectryx - it's in the

342
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:50,730
maximization with spectryx - it's in the definition you can see

343
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:50,740


344
00:21:50,740 --> 00:23:21,280
no but this is a culture and then what we do is revealed electron that you

345
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,870
we do is revealed electron that you completed here and that function will

346
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:30,530
completed here and that function will give you the optimal x2

347
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:30,540


348
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:36,320
yes are equal to I this is the optimum value of its to first try thinking three

349
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,940
value of its to first try thinking three vistas thereafter on volume

350
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,030
vistas thereafter on volume now we computed with my electron is when

351
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,520
now we computed with my electron is when we live payload so we can go back to the

352
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,560
we live payload so we can go back to the function the palace for each one if x1

353
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,600
function the palace for each one if x1 what's the corresponding X to the

354
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,170
what's the corresponding X to the maximizes this and piggy x1 + 2 x2 equal

355
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,660
maximizes this and piggy x1 + 2 x2 equal to that so degree when we beat

356
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:02,330
to that so degree when we beat elimination I'm going to write from the

357
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:07,820
elimination I'm going to write from the list of every we marginalize now it's

358
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,860
list of every we marginalize now it's okay to find the maximum of this joint

359
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,810
okay to find the maximum of this joint distribution yes it's a terrible

360
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,670
distribution yes it's a terrible calculation from the lives to the world

361
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,730
calculation from the lives to the world but to find the extra store do the job

362
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,930
but to find the extra store do the job we have to go backwards right so we now

363
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,060
we have to go backwards right so we now have to go and say you know what

364
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,910
have to go and say you know what we know that the X 2's would maximize

365
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,790
we know that the X 2's would maximize this for each X 1 but we know X 1 so

366
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,950
this for each X 1 but we know X 1 so this will give you the proper X 2 and

367
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,560
this will give you the proper X 2 and then he worked here in second awhat to

368
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,690
then he worked here in second awhat to do this maximization I need to know X 1

369
00:24:35,690 --> 00:25:16,490
do this maximization I need to know X 1 and so in between X 1 and you connect

370
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,740
and so in between X 1 and you connect them together what is not going to make

371
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,630
them together what is not going to make an optimal path for the joint is the

372
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,750
an optimal path for the joint is the beauty

373
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,850
beauty all right so there are infinite paths

374
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,620
all right so there are infinite paths now you need to select the optimal path

375
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,630
now you need to select the optimal path by going back to the help you receive

376
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,000
by going back to the help you receive that so what we describe is actually

377
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,610
that so what we describe is actually very general but the implementation of

378
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,159
very general but the implementation of this the little language does distort it

379
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:41,590
this the little language does distort it a lot of models is called a return be

380
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,720
a lot of models is called a return be away from that system moves from the end

381
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,840
away from that system moves from the end of the most famous ability computer

382
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,909
of the most famous ability computer science okay

383
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:52,659
science okay it's used everywhere okay so so this is

384
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:56,830
it's used everywhere okay so so this is a very useful problem okay and and you

385
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,950
a very useful problem okay and and you can appreciate basically that now yes we

386
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,909
can appreciate basically that now yes we go forward

387
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:02,650
go forward we go from the links to the route

388
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,590
we go from the links to the route basically to find the maximum but to

389
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,600
basically to find the maximum but to find the x that leads to a maximum we

390
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,520
find the x that leads to a maximum we have to go backwards so there is a

391
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,200
have to go backwards so there is a forward calculation is a powerful

392
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,610
forward calculation is a powerful calculation similarly what we did with

393
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,250
calculation similarly what we did with the sample based on away with sending

394
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,510
the sample based on away with sending messages forward and backward basically

395
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,780
messages forward and backward basically to be able to compute marginals turn and

396
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:32,919
to be able to compute marginals turn and things like operation is basically you

397
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:35,680
things like operation is basically you just discuss it right so it looks the

398
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,440
just discuss it right so it looks the the initialization and the evidence is

399
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,120
the initialization and the evidence is exactly the same algorithm that you use

400
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,799
exactly the same algorithm that you use in the in actually this is the algorithm

401
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,280
in the in actually this is the algorithm that we used for the elimination you

402
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,320
that we used for the elimination you know but here I call this I suppose is

403
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,090
know but here I call this I suppose is hope is not a typo

404
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,030
hope is not a typo all right I mean I suppose not much from

405
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:01,450
all right I mean I suppose not much from you know SQL for Staters but here I

406
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,419
you know SQL for Staters but here I maybe this for the general distribution

407
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:08,409
maybe this for the general distribution with the map so anyways we initialize

408
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:10,450
with the map so anyways we initialize the same we have a directed graph we

409
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,070
the same we have a directed graph we initialize all the potentials we put

410
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,760
initialize all the potentials we put them on active list we introduced

411
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,590
them on active list we introduced evidence potentials the way we did

412
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,039
evidence potentials the way we did before and now we have to do the update

413
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,650
before and now we have to do the update all right and the updates are basically

414
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,990
all right and the updates are basically what I described with a particular

415
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,030
what I described with a particular example if you pick up

416
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:33,890
example if you pick up elimination over their 90th node I you

417
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:37,000
elimination over their 90th node I you find all the potentials that are

418
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,240
find all the potentials that are interesting node I and then you do

419
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,300
interesting node I and then you do stream optimize with respect to X I all

420
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:44,690
stream optimize with respect to X I all right

421
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,880
right and once you maximize with respective

422
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,790
and once you maximize with respective time you call this new potential you

423
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,680
time you call this new potential you will put this in potential of the octave

424
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,900
will put this in potential of the octave list okay this time the remaining

425
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,050
list okay this time the remaining knowledge from the elimination click and

426
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:01,180
knowledge from the elimination click and then the key proceeding until basically

427
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,840
then the key proceeding until basically you whatever number you gave up when you

428
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,820
you whatever number you gave up when you maximized with respect to the root node

429
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,170
maximized with respect to the root node will be the max want to join

430
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:43,100
will be the max want to join distribution optimization jointly no

431
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,600
distribution optimization jointly no it's right that you complete for

432
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,330
it's right that you complete for different you know there are there's no

433
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,850
different you know there are there's no you shall not eliminate it but you see

434
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,790
you shall not eliminate it but you see okay so for the possible values of this

435
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:56,300
okay so for the possible values of this you need need to keep track what is the

436
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,110
you need need to keep track what is the maximize your value X I okay and then

437
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:04,790
maximize your value X I okay and then when units eventually the root and you

438
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:08,450
when units eventually the root and you calculate the actual note the maximizes

439
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,440
calculate the actual note the maximizes the final potential that you get when

440
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,990
the final potential that you get when you go backwards and you can calculate

441
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,040
you go backwards and you can calculate the remaining of the

442
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,380
the remaining of the so this is not solely the sound good but

443
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:24,580
so this is not solely the sound good but basically what I described

444
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:24,590


445
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:32,150
so actually we the the calculations and the mysticism if you think of this as a

446
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,230
the mysticism if you think of this as a message passing algorithm it looks

447
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,130
message passing algorithm it looks identical to what we have done for the

448
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:43,940
identical to what we have done for the you know the the only difference except

449
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,930
you know the the only difference except of summations we now have maximization

450
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:51,470
of summations we now have maximization arguments all right so what the shown

451
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,060
arguments all right so what the shown here is basically when you are done and

452
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,530
here is basically when you are done and you have rates of the route all right so

453
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,410
you have rates of the route all right so then here it's the rate directly we have

454
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:04,610
then here it's the rate directly we have an evidence potential and the message is

455
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:08,270
an evidence potential and the message is coming from the children of the root to

456
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,550
coming from the children of the root to the root all right and then what you

457
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,320
the root all right and then what you need to do the only argument here is to

458
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,930
need to do the only argument here is to accept and they need most maximize with

459
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,960
accept and they need most maximize with accept all right so that we give you the

460
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,470
accept all right so that we give you the argument you know the know what's the

461
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,540
argument you know the know what's the value of the root note that the

462
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,760
value of the root note that the maximization and then what we have to do

463
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,810
maximization and then what we have to do is you have to build rapport we

464
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,880
is you have to build rapport we distribute command that you see here -

465
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:38,120
distribute command that you see here - actually that jointly we must join

466
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:50,810
actually that jointly we must join distribution at the message an arbitrary

467
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:55,040
distribution at the message an arbitrary no J's and try it's exactly what we have

468
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,340
no J's and try it's exactly what we have looked with with elimination algorithm

469
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,160
looked with with elimination algorithm before this is the evidence potential

470
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:06,950
before this is the evidence potential this is the parent potential phi xj and

471
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,700
this is the parent potential phi xj and this xi message is the go to node J

472
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,380
this xi message is the go to node J except I so basically the J sense try

473
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,590
except I so basically the J sense try it's not evidence this join potential

474
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,450
it's not evidence this join potential and all the masses are having to J

475
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,540
and all the masses are having to J except from now the I

476
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,420
except from now the I the basement of standing of three

477
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:31,540
the basement of standing of three neutralizing it said okay I need to get

478
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:37,300
neutralizing it said okay I need to get back the XJ right so we find the match

479
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,840
back the XJ right so we find the match to move here so we compute the XJ that

480
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,480
to move here so we compute the XJ that maximizes this alright but we need to

481
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:50,830
maximizes this alright but we need to find this as a function of X I notice

482
00:31:50,830 --> 00:32:40,570
find this as a function of X I notice from children effects and then who is

483
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:43,240
from children effects and then who is this the bound and one step further down

484
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,670
this the bound and one step further down and we were to compute basically both

485
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:49,990
and we were to compute basically both the exits up to at least the point is

486
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:55,750
the exits up to at least the point is right if you calculate the X J's don't

487
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,240
right if you calculate the X J's don't maximize this whole bunch of exercise

488
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,400
maximize this whole bunch of exercise all right and unique need to keep track

489
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,310
all right and unique need to keep track nothing about maps my batteries because

490
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,140
nothing about maps my batteries because you will need to do this message passing

491
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,990
you will need to do this message passing on this much for that algorithm but also

492
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,940
on this much for that algorithm but also you need to keep values of the optimal

493
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,370
you need to keep values of the optimal taste for its participant bonds of X I

494
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,850
taste for its participant bonds of X I you need this until you get to root this

495
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,890
you need this until you get to root this is where this bullet changed because of

496
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,810
is where this bullet changed because of the work you will know what X is and

497
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,910
the work you will know what X is and then you can mark and compute all the

498
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:26,460
then you can mark and compute all the other exit

499
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:26,470


500
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:33,849
all right again you have to do this because the if

501
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:37,419
again you have to do this because the if you start selecting among them the sum

502
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:40,419
you start selecting among them the sum of the X J's that maximize this for

503
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:42,339
of the X J's that maximize this for whatever xre you're not going to get a

504
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:44,229
whatever xre you're not going to get a consistent solution basically so you get

505
00:33:44,229 --> 00:33:48,279
consistent solution basically so you get the wrong solution and if I can show you

506
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:51,339
the wrong solution and if I can show you this actually please to grab some core

507
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:56,729
this actually please to grab some core I'm going to come back to this right so

508
00:33:56,729 --> 00:33:56,739


509
00:33:56,739 --> 00:34:05,229
you know if you have a Markov chain and you know extra let's say can take three

510
00:34:05,229 --> 00:34:06,729
you know extra let's say can take three five or six you can take three values

511
00:34:06,729 --> 00:34:13,539
five or six you can take three values etcetera xn xn plus 1 so this is one

512
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:15,940
etcetera xn xn plus 1 so this is one possible this is another possible part

513
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:26,919
possible this is another possible part right this is the optimal value and then

514
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:30,039
right this is the optimal value and then basically from there you find what is

515
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:32,589
basically from there you find what is the corresponding previous value for

516
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:35,109
the corresponding previous value for that value there is no and from there

517
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:37,329
that value there is no and from there with the corresponding value of xn and

518
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:39,700
with the corresponding value of xn and then xn minus 1 so basically you will

519
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,889
then xn minus 1 so basically you will find which is the consisting the

520
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:43,980
find which is the consisting the consistent part that gives you

521
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:48,590
consistent part that gives you maximization of the joint

522
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:48,600


523
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,010
again this is one of this little things right that you need to have to program

524
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,950
right that you need to have to program the state in action alright and what is

525
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:59,730
the state in action alright and what is interesting here is again the algorithm

526
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,140
interesting here is again the algorithm gives you the impression to start with

527
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,960
gives you the impression to start with but you can only you can maximize it by

528
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,570
but you can only you can maximize it by a forward calculation but to figure out

529
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:11,340
a forward calculation but to figure out the the argument the extras but maximize

530
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,070
the the argument the extras but maximize jointly the join you have to do the

531
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,350
jointly the join you have to do the Marquart algorithm as well and that's

532
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:24,720
Marquart algorithm as well and that's what this is all about let me see and

533
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,950
what this is all about let me see and I'm going to pick it up from where we

534
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,670
I'm going to pick it up from where we left it

535
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:36,150
left it so basically you notice that from the

536
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,490
so basically you notice that from the previous comics let's say and I'm not

537
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,530
previous comics let's say and I'm not sure you know maybe this will come in

538
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,240
sure you know maybe this will come in the next clock work but the clever

539
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,240
the next clock work but the clever program that we you know the multi

540
00:35:48,240 --> 00:36:24,750
program that we you know the multi rejection inspector you can okay working

541
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,570
rejection inspector you can okay working with messages the way we have seen

542
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,859
with messages the way we have seen before

543
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:30,869


544
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:35,790
shows notifications then become additions and the algorithm becomes much

545
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,310
additions and the algorithm becomes much time and relation that this is working

546
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,880
time and relation that this is working is basically if you try to maximize the

547
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,670
is basically if you try to maximize the joint of the effect with respect to X

548
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,410
joint of the effect with respect to X and you take the long this is the same

549
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,650
and you take the long this is the same as much rising with respect X the log of

550
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,140
as much rising with respect X the log of P of X

551
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,339
P of X which most defining eggs to be able to

552
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:59,000
which most defining eggs to be able to the masses it's alright if I define H to

553
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,980
the masses it's alright if I define H to be the lots of the messages this is how

554
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,710
be the lots of the messages this is how the algorithm looks like okay so the

555
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:06,019
the algorithm looks like okay so the name of the message from JP y por el

556
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:09,319
name of the message from JP y por el festival values over time is the target

557
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:11,059
festival values over time is the target remember we have in the progress of the

558
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:58,430
remember we have in the progress of the incoming messages okay okay because with

559
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,999
incoming messages okay okay because with messages okay every a lot of these

560
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:03,759
messages okay every a lot of these messages will be extremely small and

561
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:05,930
messages will be extremely small and basically this message will be an

562
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:09,289
basically this message will be an informative and getting lots of zeros 10

563
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,569
informative and getting lots of zeros 10 to the minus 50 10 to the minus 30 etc

564
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:14,480
to the minus 50 10 to the minus 30 etc get in trouble so this is another flow

565
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,370
get in trouble so this is another flow problem that in fact using logs right

566
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,589
problem that in fact using logs right and doing these two missions aware is

567
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:24,410
and doing these two missions aware is the scope and even then there is the

568
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:28,640
the scope and even then there is the peak that you can find Pataca lee if you

569
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,359
peak that you can find Pataca lee if you start even in math you have you known

570
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:35,720
start even in math you have you known the toolbox everywhere on

571
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,980
the toolbox everywhere on Jevon method muslim to ducks or any

572
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,490
Jevon method muslim to ducks or any penny some problems you find whether

573
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,020
penny some problems you find whether they here's this message passing on what

574
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:50,330
they here's this message passing on what if the sort of positive use thanks for

575
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,370
if the sort of positive use thanks for the message this right but that

576
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,320
the message this right but that shouldn't be an addition i think well i

577
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,180
shouldn't be an addition i think well i wanted to show you because if you

578
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,770
wanted to show you because if you program without this trick and i what i

579
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,240
program without this trick and i what i want to go you're not going to be able

580
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,810
want to go you're not going to be able to actually do large-scale profits so

581
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:05,900
to actually do large-scale profits so here's where the three kids so the

582
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,490
here's where the three kids so the message is this is what we have before

583
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,830
message is this is what we have before I'm writing this in the context of the

584
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:13,970
I'm writing this in the context of the eliminating expected a so you can have

585
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,530
eliminating expected a so you can have the marks operator that's exactly the

586
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,859
the marks operator that's exactly the same thing so we use no messages all

587
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:23,599
same thing so we use no messages all right and so summation Alexei of this x

588
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,820
right and so summation Alexei of this x naught and because this are love

589
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,550
naught and because this are love messages I can write this then you see

590
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,620
messages I can write this then you see this would become estimation all right

591
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,580
this would become estimation all right and if I put outside because this term

592
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,320
and if I put outside because this term of masters and when I have an

593
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:46,190
of masters and when I have an exponential inside okay we need this

594
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,290
exponential inside okay we need this looks extremely complex right because we

595
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:52,520
looks extremely complex right because we have to find the local summation and by

596
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,950
have to find the local summation and by the way all estimation is very typical

597
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,290
the way all estimation is very typical in many other words in machine learning

598
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,830
in many other words in machine learning okay you cannot take this long and put

599
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:04,520
okay you cannot take this long and put it inside so novel destination in exit

600
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,330
it inside so novel destination in exit any survivors two terms as exponential

601
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,849
any survivors two terms as exponential of the law website this is what they

602
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:14,359
of the law website this is what they have and because I put the exponential

603
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:16,700
have and because I put the exponential of try so here I have a summation

604
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,660
of try so here I have a summation alright so you take all of this and you

605
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,740
alright so you take all of this and you call it ln j alright this is where they

606
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,050
call it ln j alright this is where they have exponential of halides a and then

607
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,930
have exponential of halides a and then you find out the maximum the prime

608
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,800
you find out the maximum the prime business that maximizes that is the

609
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,680
business that maximizes that is the maximum basically from all the holidays

610
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,770
maximum basically from all the holidays so you pull this out

611
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:41,850
so you pull this out and then with the leftist exponential of

612
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:49,800
and then with the leftist exponential of mij - mi z okay and this is how

613
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,000
mij - mi z okay and this is how basically you have to implement the log

614
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,160
basically you have to implement the log messages when you write your computer

615
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,640
messages when you write your computer program you can play with this and

616
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,160
program you can play with this and convince yourself actually that this

617
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,550
convince yourself actually that this avoids other flow issues the way it did

618
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:09,210
avoids other flow issues the way it did here okay so study members of this

619
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:12,180
here okay so study members of this little algorithm Stephan actually if you

620
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:16,020
little algorithm Stephan actually if you see it in computer programs you know

621
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,340
see it in computer programs you know know that these nothing strange

622
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:24,240
know that these nothing strange basically comes by the algebra okay can

623
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,190
basically comes by the algebra okay can you do too much time algorithm graphs

624
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,600
you do too much time algorithm graphs there are stories of course you can do

625
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,880
there are stories of course you can do anything you want to and if we use again

626
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,290
anything you want to and if we use again some messages the message the normal

627
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,130
some messages the message the normal condition is basically the track system

628
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:44,640
condition is basically the track system that saved in the list node the message

629
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,960
that saved in the list node the message that we send to the clique the first

630
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,830
that we send to the clique the first factor is zero unity when we did last

631
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,720
factor is zero unity when we did last lecture this message will come after

632
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,220
lecture this message will come after equal to AB natural pesticides is zero

633
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,450
equal to AB natural pesticides is zero and if the first value is a path then

634
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,520
and if the first value is a path then the message is the lung of the potential

635
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:08,550
the message is the lung of the potential of the factor and this is so this is the

636
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,010
of the factor and this is so this is the message is basically that we were

637
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:13,320
message is basically that we were working on the last lecture if you want

638
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,090
working on the last lecture if you want to send a message from a factor to a

639
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:18,780
to send a message from a factor to a node potential if you take all the

640
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,280
node potential if you take all the messages to derive from all the

641
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,200
messages to derive from all the neighbors of the factor except at that

642
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,570
neighbors of the factor except at that arrived to the factor you multiply them

643
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,080
arrived to the factor you multiply them and then you have you basically

644
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,420
and then you have you basically eliminate you integrate our x12 except

645
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:36,840
eliminate you integrate our x12 except all the nodes are involved in the fact

646
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,980
all the nodes are involved in the fact will accept nowadays okay so instantly

647
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,290
will accept nowadays okay so instantly if you wanted to find the message and

648
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,750
if you wanted to find the message and now since the factor

649
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:52,010
now since the factor is the message that central that no that

650
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,110
is the message that central that no that step of course the factor of pest so you

651
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,090
step of course the factor of pest so you might have been of incoming messages and

652
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,580
might have been of incoming messages and you fought with them the factor of s so

653
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,650
you fought with them the factor of s so if you take those and exchange the

654
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,900
if you take those and exchange the summations for the match operator and

655
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,370
summations for the match operator and you want to do a march time I will

656
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:09,220
you want to do a march time I will contact the graphs very trivial the

657
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,740
contact the graphs very trivial the message from dr. Novak's is the match

658
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,440
message from dr. Novak's is the match list all right notice we're going to

659
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,400
list all right notice we're going to have a love of this and estimation here

660
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,980
have a love of this and estimation here so obviously when I make this equation

661
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,470
so obviously when I make this equation the implication is that now this mere

662
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:27,470
the implication is that now this mere solutions of the actual messages right

663
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:32,180
solutions of the actual messages right there loves that's why you see here the

664
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,930
there loves that's why you see here the problem became estimation and and again

665
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,570
problem became estimation and and again from a note the fact that you notice the

666
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:41,120
from a note the fact that you notice the product becomes oscillation and the rest

667
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,170
product becomes oscillation and the rest is basic and the history when you reach

668
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:49,130
is basic and the history when you reach the root node you'll be able to find the

669
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,770
the root node you'll be able to find the value of x that does the maximization of

670
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:54,410
value of x that does the maximization of the fold where the summation of all the

671
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,860
the fold where the summation of all the messages coming from below and and then

672
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,270
messages coming from below and and then you need to do backtracking

673
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,490
you need to do backtracking from the root back all the way to the

674
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:06,520
from the root back all the way to the list to figure out what of the x's that

675
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:06,530


676
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:13,250
maximize the Joint Distribution so then if you have an implementation of the

677
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,410
if you have an implementation of the sample of the target for photographs you

678
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:18,770
sample of the target for photographs you can transform it to a nautical algorithm

679
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,960
can transform it to a nautical algorithm by changing the definitions of the

680
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,690
by changing the definitions of the salmon exchanging terms with the match

681
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:29,300
salmon exchanging terms with the match operator and if you're not already doing

682
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,430
operator and if you're not already doing this and you have to do this in your

683
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:34,630
this and you have to do this in your homework trying basically not to use

684
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,310
homework trying basically not to use messages will now use log message to see

685
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:44,820
messages will now use log message to see how things will look like

686
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:44,830


687
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:54,130
this mystery is the same thing we just discussed from the on a simple train as

688
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:58,690
discussed from the on a simple train as an example all right so that have a

689
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:01,150
an example all right so that have a message that you see on this block I

690
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,250
message that you see on this block I think this is the negation of a graph we

691
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,320
think this is the negation of a graph we had on an earlier lecture but now the

692
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,360
had on an earlier lecture but now the way I have it all the messages are

693
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,380
way I have it all the messages are basically for the for calculating the

694
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,130
basically for the for calculating the maximum distribution and they are lost

695
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:18,430
maximum distribution and they are lost so from that they are the same so the

696
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:27,370
so from that they are the same so the message to this right is the same as the

697
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:29,440
message to this right is the same as the message from this particle to this node

698
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,290
message from this particle to this node so whatever because this is same

699
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:35,230
so whatever because this is same whatever message this not receive from

700
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,850
whatever message this not receive from this factor sense it called with an X

701
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:41,980
this factor sense it called with an X Factor and if you want to find the

702
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:47,230
Factor and if you want to find the message let's see this is the message

703
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:51,480
message let's see this is the message from the factor n minus 1 n who is not

704
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,240
from the factor n minus 1 n who is not so this is we want to compute this

705
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,080
so this is we want to compute this message here right this is what we want

706
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,210
message here right this is what we want to compute so this message you know what

707
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:07,200
to compute so this message you know what the basis is this times incoming message

708
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,970
the basis is this times incoming message so what we're gonna do is we're gonna

709
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:12,580
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take the arc match with respect to X n

710
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:17,950
take the arc match with respect to X n minus 1 Indianness HN minus 1 I'm

711
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,870
minus 1 Indianness HN minus 1 I'm carrying the potential we now have the

712
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:22,180
carrying the potential we now have the real potential last incoming message

713
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:27,780
real potential last incoming message which is here okay that's basically the

714
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,510
which is here okay that's basically the two relations that you need to be able

715
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:43,170
two relations that you need to be able to propagate messages for this

716
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:43,180


717
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:48,970
surrounding can you tell me what functional you wanna need to keep

718
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:52,240
what functional you wanna need to keep flaps here so here you compute the

719
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,250
flaps here so here you compute the maximum of this and you send it to this

720
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,740
maximum of this and you send it to this message but we also need to keep tariffs

721
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,920
message but we also need to keep tariffs of xn minus 1 for what for every value

722
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:06,790
of xn minus 1 for what for every value of x and you should have figure out we

723
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,340
of x and you should have figure out we need to do this maximization for our

724
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,370
need to do this maximization for our past reviews of Excel so you are gonna

725
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,640
past reviews of Excel so you are gonna need to find the optimal xn minus 1 as a

726
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:23,380
need to find the optimal xn minus 1 as a function of xn and this to the sponsors

727
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:27,220
function of xn and this to the sponsors who wrote this and then we can use all

728
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,030
who wrote this and then we can use all of this simple functions to go backwards

729
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:43,420
of this simple functions to go backwards to get all the previous section so when

730
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:49,750
to get all the previous section so when I find it say here the maximum this

731
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,860
I find it say here the maximum this expression that you see here at the same

732
00:47:53,860 --> 00:48:01,380
expression that you see here at the same time it gives me the optimal there the -

733
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:01,390


734
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:06,790
okay we will not accept all right showing the next back we also need to

735
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:10,480
showing the next back we also need to keep collection as a function of xn plus

736
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,390
keep collection as a function of xn plus 1 and xn plus 1 is a function of xn plus

737
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,300
1 and xn plus 1 is a function of xn plus 2 until we say root note where we will

738
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,040
2 until we say root note where we will be able to figure out what they would

739
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:34,450
be able to figure out what they would value is and then go backwards

740
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:34,460


741
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:40,839
so before and if I have time to tell you about the jobs action tree algorithm

742
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:47,049
about the jobs action tree algorithm wanted to just put very few slides this

743
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,180
wanted to just put very few slides this sort of historical algorithm of belief

744
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:54,010
sort of historical algorithm of belief propagation on you know directed graphs

745
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:58,660
propagation on you know directed graphs without loops these most of its work is

746
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:05,440
without loops these most of its work is in a little very important book VIPRE on

747
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,450
in a little very important book VIPRE on probabilistic reasoning intelligent

748
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:11,079
probabilistic reasoning intelligent systems you may even be able to find

749
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:14,980
systems you may even be able to find this book online and so the dimension is

750
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:21,069
this book online and so the dimension is actually it somebody knows this is based

751
00:49:21,069 --> 00:49:26,859
actually it somebody knows this is based on elimination this some product so this

752
00:49:26,859 --> 00:49:28,870
on elimination this some product so this comes out to be a sub J's

753
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,240
comes out to be a sub J's so in some sense I'm going to be

754
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,760
so in some sense I'm going to be evidently be different for directed

755
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,740
evidently be different for directed graphs but you can say that the

756
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,490
graphs but you can say that the algorithm actually looks the same okay

757
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:46,720
algorithm actually looks the same okay so so this is this out directed graph

758
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,160
so so this is this out directed graph okay so we are looking at no text use of

759
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,859
okay so we are looking at no text use of the forints effects wise of the children

760
00:49:53,859 --> 00:49:58,120
the forints effects wise of the children affection etc and physically okay so

761
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:02,400
affection etc and physically okay so this would be three note the the

762
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,839
this would be three note the the directionality of the edges basically

763
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:07,720
directionality of the edges basically you get an undirected today with single

764
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,730
you get an undirected today with single path basically from one node to any

765
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:18,160
path basically from one node to any other node the especially to be able to

766
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,579
other node the especially to be able to understand this idea of belief

767
00:50:21,579 --> 00:50:23,289
understand this idea of belief propagation but the game is the same

768
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:30,789
propagation but the game is the same algorithm so we are looking at X and so

769
00:50:30,789 --> 00:50:33,190
algorithm so we are looking at X and so the idea is that the probability of X

770
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:35,260
the idea is that the probability of X this is sort of the marginal effects

771
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,039
this is sort of the marginal effects this way we have done up now reminds

772
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:40,820
this way we have done up now reminds information from upstream and doused

773
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:44,570
information from upstream and doused so basically combines evidence

774
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,370
so basically combines evidence propagating from upstairs to and

775
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:48,050
propagating from upstairs to and evidence propagating from downstairs

776
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:53,420
evidence propagating from downstairs okay and the idea that I can submit the

777
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,460
okay and the idea that I can submit the evidence when upstream and downstream

778
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,090
evidence when upstream and downstream has to do with the park the next

779
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,380
has to do with the park the next disappearance the evidence from upstate

780
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:04,010
disappearance the evidence from upstate from up and down you can see this right

781
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:06,140
from up and down you can see this right to go if we have evidence there and

782
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,660
to go if we have evidence there and evidence out there and you have to pass

783
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,000
evidence out there and you have to pass through xxxx basically block start so

784
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,670
through xxxx basically block start so it's it does it separates the evidence

785
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:17,030
it's it does it separates the evidence from upstream and downstream so if you

786
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,650
from upstream and downstream so if you want to compute the probability of x

787
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,570
want to compute the probability of x given the evidence let's say this is our

788
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:25,210
given the evidence let's say this is our problem this is basically their belief

789
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,800
problem this is basically their belief all right that we want to compute about

790
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,110
all right that we want to compute about X so I can write this as the joint

791
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:32,600
X so I can write this as the joint affection 8 divided by the area the

792
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:36,320
affection 8 divided by the area the probability of the evidence I because

793
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,350
probability of the evidence I because the X dissipates the evidence plus and

794
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:42,500
the X dissipates the evidence plus and minus plus is the evidence of their -

795
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,220
minus plus is the evidence of their - the evidence down from it I can write

796
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:50,420
the evidence down from it I can write this yet + and against - and this is not

797
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,870
this yet + and against - and this is not important for it so we don't care so I

798
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:56,900
important for it so we don't care so I can write this as the probability of P X

799
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,900
can write this as the probability of P X minus given X and the X plus and the

800
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,780
minus given X and the X plus and the probability of x given Y X plus alright

801
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,650
probability of x given Y X plus alright and because X dissipates all right

802
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:09,290
and because X dissipates all right I can I don't need to keep the X plus

803
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:13,100
I can I don't need to keep the X plus here so this belief can be written as

804
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,550
here so this belief can be written as the community coming from upstream

805
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,060
the community coming from upstream evidence and this time that is the

806
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,350
evidence and this time that is the probability coming from downstream

807
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:25,760
probability coming from downstream evidence ok so this is basically using

808
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,280
evidence ok so this is basically using Bayes rule and the fact that we have a

809
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,830
Bayes rule and the fact that we have a dissipation here that I used in this

810
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:39,390
dissipation here that I used in this equation it allows me to write the

811
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:43,839
equation it allows me to write the the belief of the you know they in this

812
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,520
the belief of the you know they in this case is conditional on the evidence

813
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,289
case is conditional on the evidence right but you can think of the

814
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,120
right but you can think of the calculations we were doing area for

815
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,980
calculations we were doing area for marginals that they were sort of the

816
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:54,309
marginals that they were sort of the Train so think of this as the Masters

817
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:57,819
Train so think of this as the Masters coming from upstream five semesters come

818
00:52:57,819 --> 00:52:59,530
coming from upstream five semesters come from downstream isn't it what we did

819
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:02,770
from downstream isn't it what we did when we computed the marginal right is

820
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:04,839
when we computed the marginal right is the product of the two messages but now

821
00:53:04,839 --> 00:53:08,109
the product of the two messages but now you notice this things basically will

822
00:53:08,109 --> 00:53:09,819
you notice this things basically will derive from Vegas rule

823
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,920
derive from Vegas rule I'm not going to level a depending by

824
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,740
I'm not going to level a depending by the simplistic we can philosophize on

825
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:19,539
the simplistic we can philosophize on this but you can call this you can put a

826
00:53:19,539 --> 00:53:23,799
this but you can call this you can put a prior or next right and apply of naming

827
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:26,230
prior or next right and apply of naming and this is the likelihood a discount

828
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:27,940
and this is the likelihood a discount from downstream but right now you know

829
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:32,789
from downstream but right now you know we have to compute these ten that is

830
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:34,839
we have to compute these ten that is information coming from upstream and

831
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:39,809
information coming from upstream and disturb that comes from from downstream

832
00:53:39,809 --> 00:53:39,819


833
00:53:39,819 --> 00:53:45,039
which in combined ups limit downstream information to find the probability of x

834
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:51,250
information to find the probability of x idea to that this message does we know

835
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,890
idea to that this message does we know can be computed by local message passing

836
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:57,599
can be computed by local message passing algorithm which we have seen okay and

837
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,130
algorithm which we have seen okay and the last idea which also we have

838
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:02,319
the last idea which also we have discussed it they never sent to annul

839
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:05,039
discussed it they never sent to annul and investors the note sent to you

840
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,700
and investors the note sent to you that's it so I am going to move you the

841
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,620
that's it so I am going to move you the equations and I want you to actually

842
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,359
equations and I want you to actually study them because they have a

843
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:25,140
study them because they have a historical significance to be the

844
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,220
historical significance to be the conditional probability of x given the

845
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:31,140
conditional probability of x given the evidence and we just take this as the

846
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:35,020
evidence and we just take this as the information coming now let me see what

847
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,460
information coming now let me see what the definition here coming from

848
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:39,370
the definition here coming from downstream so this comes this term

849
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:41,109
downstream so this comes this term lambda comes from the children this is

850
00:54:41,109 --> 00:54:43,630
lambda comes from the children this is what we derived various room and this is

851
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:45,220
what we derived various room and this is the information coming from the parents

852
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,120
the information coming from the parents okay certainly

853
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,410
okay certainly I'm gonna give you the message passing

854
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,990
I'm gonna give you the message passing algorithm but that's you what lambda is

855
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,850
algorithm but that's you what lambda is and what PI is based on what we have

856
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:55,280
and what PI is based on what we have done alright so we need the information

857
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,170
done alright so we need the information coming from the children but extract

858
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,550
coming from the children but extract looking at this graph can return me with

859
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:04,820
looking at this graph can return me with message passing algorithms what is the

860
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,830
message passing algorithms what is the information that comes from the children

861
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:14,650
information that comes from the children to X

862
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:14,660


863
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:18,789
and again timbers you know there on this slide but tell me which words basically

864
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:22,559
slide but tell me which words basically I want to find all the information comes

865
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:27,009
I want to find all the information comes from mastering 2x and I want to be this

866
00:55:27,009 --> 00:55:29,529
from mastering 2x and I want to be this through messages of the children of X +

867
00:55:29,529 --> 00:55:36,309
through messages of the children of X + 2 X so that is round effect is the

868
00:55:36,309 --> 00:55:47,480
2 X so that is round effect is the product at what

869
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:47,490


870
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:54,950
is the protocol for the messages the chinder of X send text isn't it the way

871
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,050
chinder of X send text isn't it the way we have done it before - with masters

872
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:00,410
we have done it before - with masters passing all right so there's nothing

873
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:02,270
passing all right so there's nothing better one to fix is the program to

874
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,460
better one to fix is the program to folder messages which raised the

875
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:09,580
folder messages which raised the children of text right sent correct okay

876
00:56:09,580 --> 00:57:04,310
children of text right sent correct okay let's now calculate the information of

877
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:04,320


878
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:10,840
[Applause]

879
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:10,850


880
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:25,730
the effects by taking the product of far upstream and downstream children sent to

881
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:28,700
upstream and downstream children sent to X to be able to do waste then I have to

882
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,370
X to be able to do waste then I have to complete the information of the VEX

883
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:33,530
complete the information of the VEX turns to children and also you are going

884
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,849
turns to children and also you are going to have to compute the information

885
00:57:34,849 --> 00:57:38,630
to have to compute the information access to its parents right you're not

886
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:39,770
access to its parents right you're not gonna be able to calculate these

887
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:42,260
gonna be able to calculate these messages too long so you have to

888
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:46,230
messages too long so you have to calculate those master as well

889
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:46,240


890
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:54,000
this is what particular logically this is the method the XS it's part of your

891
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,800
is the method the XS it's part of your high so we have the question can it just

892
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,070
high so we have the question can it just you know anomic look at the questions

893
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:03,930
you know anomic look at the questions look at this picture can you tell me

894
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:07,680
look at this picture can you tell me what in what master deck sense to the

895
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,200
what in what master deck sense to the trade to you i what will it's time to

896
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:16,260
trade to you i what will it's time to act - you are what information actual

897
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:22,110
act - you are what information actual center yard

898
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:22,120


899
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:27,560
and examples right with message-passing story if I am asking whether extents to

900
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,170
story if I am asking whether extents to you I so which is this message what

901
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:37,650
you I so which is this message what wouldn't do

902
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:37,660


903
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:49,049
yes percent is received from the from your children because the amount of

904
00:58:49,049 --> 00:58:50,999
your children because the amount of facts here was the person after former

905
00:58:50,999 --> 00:59:05,249
facts here was the person after former messages from the kids okay because you

906
00:59:05,249 --> 00:59:08,930
messages from the kids okay because you actually see from you are and you do etc

907
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:12,269
actually see from you are and you do etc so if you need to do this again the

908
00:59:12,269 --> 00:59:15,569
so if you need to do this again the potential this is like the clip

909
00:59:15,569 --> 00:59:18,180
potential this is like the clip potentially relax live in its past times

910
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,329
potentially relax live in its past times the messages we received from all of the

911
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:23,400
the messages we received from all of the other parents you notice k not equal to

912
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,349
other parents you notice k not equal to I and then of course that you need to do

913
00:59:25,349 --> 00:59:28,259
I and then of course that you need to do is to integrate that child and of course

914
00:59:28,259 --> 00:59:29,490
is to integrate that child and of course in this time we are going to have to

915
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,470
in this time we are going to have to integrate all the other parents out

916
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:33,599
integrate all the other parents out right and what you got here semesters

917
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,980
right and what you got here semesters with this defense on a UI it's exactly

918
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:40,710
with this defense on a UI it's exactly the same as before shown with messages

919
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,809
the same as before shown with messages the wave have dominated with message

920
00:59:42,809 --> 00:59:45,150
the wave have dominated with message passing it looks very plain but this is

921
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:48,210
passing it looks very plain but this is an anomaly because she was developed in

922
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:51,779
an anomaly because she was developed in nineteen eighty fifty people talking

923
00:59:51,779 --> 00:59:53,849
nineteen eighty fifty people talking about must in learning in any serious

924
00:59:53,849 --> 00:59:58,309
about must in learning in any serious extent right and so this has been

925
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:23,400
extent right and so this has been experienced in text so you say them to

926
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,009
experienced in text so you say them to children say so you're not a skiing not

927
01:00:26,009 --> 01:00:28,289
children say so you're not a skiing not equal to say but also you send all the

928
01:00:28,289 --> 01:00:31,859
equal to say but also you send all the messages the parent effects and text

929
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:34,410
messages the parent effects and text which is what we have here with all the

930
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,980
which is what we have here with all the use integrate our

931
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,960
use integrate our she says the product before the mess is

932
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,330
she says the product before the mess is coming from all the kids but they shall

933
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:43,160
coming from all the kids but they shall actually to multiply with the message

934
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,560
actually to multiply with the message coming from that syndrome jail as well

935
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,920
coming from that syndrome jail as well and divide you can arrive the message

936
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,310
and divide you can arrive the message that you sent to a children's I as the

937
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:56,859
that you sent to a children's I as the Bourbon Arabic divided by the misses

938
01:00:56,859 --> 01:01:01,930
Bourbon Arabic divided by the misses that the children James tends to you

939
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:05,840
that the children James tends to you the message that they sent you do you

940
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:09,109
the message that they sent you do you remember when you like this right invoke

941
01:01:09,109 --> 01:01:11,780
remember when you like this right invoke this times the message that children

942
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:14,660
this times the message that children Jason's Plex which we're gonna listen to

943
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:17,090
Jason's Plex which we're gonna listen to what I'm gonna serve to tell you whether

944
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:22,670
what I'm gonna serve to tell you whether it's sent to us so we / it and you have

945
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:25,640
it's sent to us so we / it and you have this belief of X divided by this message

946
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,250
this belief of X divided by this message you know she has some electric

947
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,770
you know she has some electric advantages fear there and in some of the

948
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,260
advantages fear there and in some of the implementations of this message passing

949
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:36,380
implementations of this message passing algorithm you may see this type of

950
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:40,100
algorithm you may see this type of division so rather than saying do this

951
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,790
division so rather than saying do this multiplication for K different today

952
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:45,740
multiplication for K different today which another way of writing it right so

953
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:51,500
which another way of writing it right so the military / the message that wage and

954
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:55,880
the military / the message that wage and Jerry sent to X am I giving you a

955
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:59,660
Jerry sent to X am I giving you a headache already a little bit yes you

956
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:12,589
headache already a little bit yes you said yes yes all right

957
01:02:12,589 --> 01:02:12,599


958
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:16,579
the slides are up on the web actually which I put them to get today alright so

959
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:19,189
which I put them to get today alright so there they trade their pipe so you don't

960
01:02:19,189 --> 01:02:21,709
there they trade their pipe so you don't have to I'm just writing a questions and

961
01:02:21,709 --> 01:02:24,319
have to I'm just writing a questions and tastes different than Jame and all of

962
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:27,109
tastes different than Jame and all of this can't duplicate this but yet it

963
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:30,140
this can't duplicate this but yet it takes so much of platform okay this is

964
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:31,789
takes so much of platform okay this is for professors who have nothing to do at

965
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:34,429
for professors who have nothing to do at night to just do lots of typing of our

966
01:02:34,429 --> 01:02:34,939
night to just do lots of typing of our slides

967
01:02:34,939 --> 01:02:37,669
slides okay ensue exception obviously this

968
01:02:37,669 --> 01:02:41,749
okay ensue exception obviously this semester with his slides and but in some

969
01:02:41,749 --> 01:02:46,130
semester with his slides and but in some sense when I ask you to type the

970
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,739
sense when I ask you to type the homework that is the reason right when

971
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:50,719
homework that is the reason right when you type things you look at them and you

972
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:52,849
you type things you look at them and you take a look again and again you say you

973
01:02:52,849 --> 01:02:55,009
take a look again and again you say you know what doesn't look right and if it

974
01:02:55,009 --> 01:02:56,779
know what doesn't look right and if it doesn't look like it is not right

975
01:02:56,779 --> 01:02:58,640
doesn't look like it is not right and you can only say that when you type

976
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,900
and you can only say that when you type them when you do like that everything

977
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:06,459
them when you do like that everything but right good or bad you know I mean

978
01:03:06,459 --> 01:03:10,009
but right good or bad you know I mean but when you type it it visually doesn't

979
01:03:10,009 --> 01:03:12,049
but when you type it it visually doesn't look right it's most probably not right

980
01:03:12,049 --> 01:03:17,239
look right it's most probably not right okay any questions all right

981
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:21,319
okay any questions all right so I am saying no because 132 so let me

982
01:03:21,319 --> 01:03:26,449
so I am saying no because 132 so let me do it correctly I am going to discuss

983
01:03:26,449 --> 01:03:27,919
do it correctly I am going to discuss the junction tree algorithm and I'm

984
01:03:27,919 --> 01:03:30,049
the junction tree algorithm and I'm gonna give you it's sufficient time

985
01:03:30,049 --> 01:03:32,419
gonna give you it's sufficient time actually to go through this today is an

986
01:03:32,419 --> 01:03:34,249
actually to go through this today is an introduction and I'm gonna give you

987
01:03:34,249 --> 01:03:38,059
introduction and I'm gonna give you formally the structure of the algorithm

988
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:45,140
formally the structure of the algorithm when we go back to it on Tuesday friends

989
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:47,659
when we go back to it on Tuesday friends by the way of the lecture today and also

990
01:03:47,659 --> 01:03:49,849
by the way of the lecture today and also the lecture for Tuesday

991
01:03:49,849 --> 01:03:54,169
the lecture for Tuesday one of the chapters of Michael Jordan's

992
01:03:54,169 --> 01:03:56,959
one of the chapters of Michael Jordan's book or Junction 3 is basically the best

993
01:03:56,959 --> 01:03:59,449
book or Junction 3 is basically the best read for the subject okay

994
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:03,039
read for the subject okay very elementary but sort of addresses

995
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,720
very elementary but sort of addresses everything very nice

996
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:06,730


997
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:12,390
so it's course again I'm going to do this through an example to motivate with

998
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,670
this through an example to motivate with the algorithm is so let's assume that we

999
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:18,359
the algorithm is so let's assume that we have a directed graph that looks like

1000
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:18,750
have a directed graph that looks like this

1001
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:22,200
all right obviously this is not a tree right you can see it

1002
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,470
right you can see it I mean if it's they are was not there

1003
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:27,810
I mean if it's they are was not there you can claim this two three but this is

1004
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:29,490
you can claim this two three but this is not a tree so you know we have to see

1005
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:32,460
not a tree so you know we have to see how the this new algorithm is action 300

1006
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:38,280
how the this new algorithm is action 300 will help us to calculate ryx all right

1007
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,800
will help us to calculate ryx all right so what we're gonna need is I'm gonna

1008
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,130
so what we're gonna need is I'm gonna take you through the process okay so I

1009
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:47,490
take you through the process okay so I notice here so I'm going to convert this

1010
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:49,980
notice here so I'm going to convert this to an undirected graph and as we have

1011
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:54,390
to an undirected graph and as we have seen before the the first step is to

1012
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,340
seen before the the first step is to moralize basically and x5 is to balance

1013
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:58,290
moralize basically and x5 is to balance so we wanna lies that we get an

1014
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:03,570
so we wanna lies that we get an undirected graph that looks like that

1015
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:03,580


1016
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:08,430
we are going to say we're going to select an elimination order of this

1017
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:12,090
select an elimination order of this graph and we're going to keep that

1018
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:16,370
graph and we're going to keep that basically of the elimination plate and

1019
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:41,250
basically of the elimination plate and we're going to pry interpretation we

1020
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:44,820
we're going to pry interpretation we commute elimination clicks so this

1021
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:49,980
commute elimination clicks so this elimination cliques or the junction

1022
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,070
elimination cliques or the junction three that are going basically to

1023
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:56,640
three that are going basically to contain the function the factors

1024
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,030
contain the function the factors affiliated with our elimination clips we

1025
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:08,880
affiliated with our elimination clips we will see this on this particular example

1026
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:08,890


1027
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:15,130
so this is that what we got right

1028
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:15,140


1029
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:20,410
that somehow Muhammad is on the previous slide and I'm going to connect nodes X 2

1030
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:24,550
slide and I'm going to connect nodes X 2 and X 3 this is what I am saying I'm

1031
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:27,400
and X 3 this is what I am saying I'm calling it I'm going to triangulate the

1032
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,240
calling it I'm going to triangulate the glass and can you just potentially why

1033
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:38,530
glass and can you just potentially why basically I need to premonition clicks

1034
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:44,260
basically I need to premonition clicks so somebody why do you need why do I

1035
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:48,250
so somebody why do you need why do I need to triangulate the graph what

1036
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:55,300
need to triangulate the graph what potentially benefit may exist there you

1037
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:58,270
potentially benefit may exist there you know if I call notes together what is

1038
01:06:58,270 --> 01:07:01,690
know if I call notes together what is the you know this is a big potential

1039
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:03,700
the you know this is a big potential because in those for naught right so we

1040
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:07,060
because in those for naught right so we need sort of to reduce that to 3 nodes

1041
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:09,940
need sort of to reduce that to 3 nodes but blowing that there is a fundamental

1042
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:11,500
but blowing that there is a fundamental property that I will show you one we

1043
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,140
property that I will show you one we complete this that without any lighting

1044
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:16,060
complete this that without any lighting in you're not going to be able to make

1045
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:20,500
in you're not going to be able to make the junction tree algorithm or so so we

1046
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,540
the junction tree algorithm or so so we may need to tell you when we reach the

1047
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:26,740
may need to tell you when we reach the end of this example all right so the

1048
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:29,740
end of this example all right so the first reason is we want to reduce the

1049
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:31,660
first reason is we want to reduce the size of this clique but there is another

1050
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:34,060
size of this clique but there is another important aspect that we will see when

1051
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:48,490
important aspect that we will see when the algorithm produces ok is 1 2 3 1 1 2

1052
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:53,230
the algorithm produces ok is 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 ok now we're going to eliminate the

1053
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:56,050
3 ok now we're going to eliminate the chain let's see what is the next node we

1054
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:59,260
chain let's see what is the next node we want to eliminate now - ok that's our

1055
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,660
want to eliminate now - ok that's our order so the next elimination clique is

1056
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:05,550
order so the next elimination clique is 2 3 &amp; 4 2 3 or 4 this is what we left

1057
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:08,710
2 3 &amp; 4 2 3 or 4 this is what we left the next elimination clique is 3 4 &amp; 5

1058
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,180
the next elimination clique is 3 4 &amp; 5 so we will eliminate

1059
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:14,320
so we will eliminate three so three four five the next

1060
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,320
three so three four five the next elimination will be for North Shore

1061
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,420
elimination will be for North Shore so the next week would be falling five

1062
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:22,360
so the next week would be falling five and then I have time so the next week is

1063
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:26,410
and then I have time so the next week is now side and one in addition we kept

1064
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:28,840
now side and one in addition we kept track of all these plygs and I'm going

1065
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,450
track of all these plygs and I'm going to get rid of the clicks that there are

1066
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:33,820
to get rid of the clicks that there are subsets of other maximal cliques all

1067
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,380
subsets of other maximal cliques all right so what are you going to keep

1068
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:38,380
right so what are you going to keep parked at this much more clicks one two

1069
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:43,950
parked at this much more clicks one two three two three four and three four five

1070
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:43,960


1071
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:52,210
I am going to consider this as notes is in one God right so this is trick

1072
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:54,370
in one God right so this is trick this is click one two three so the notes

1073
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:57,460
this is click one two three so the notes the variables that are contained in

1074
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:01,900
the variables that are contained in notes you all are X 1 X 2 3 bottom of 63

1075
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:05,860
notes you all are X 1 X 2 3 bottom of 63 export excretes 4 X 5 so now I'm going

1076
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:10,950
export excretes 4 X 5 so now I'm going to do is I am going to pay attention to

1077
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:13,540
to do is I am going to pay attention to you notice I am connecting all of this

1078
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:16,000
you notice I am connecting all of this together but this is not really to me

1079
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,830
together but this is not really to me and so we come up with three that

1080
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:26,620
and so we come up with three that involves this right and that click will

1081
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:30,550
involves this right and that click will come with it as follows look at this

1082
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:34,900
come with it as follows look at this connection here how many nodes as the

1083
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:39,310
connection here how many nodes as the clip steps you can ask how many common

1084
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:43,750
clip steps you can ask how many common notes they have to come out this two

1085
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:51,610
notes they have to come out this two clicks who is one yes so we are going to

1086
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:58,510
clicks who is one yes so we are going to design a three that has eight something

1087
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:01,420
design a three that has eight something to resist and weight is accounted by how

1088
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:04,150
to resist and weight is accounted by how many common notes served between these

1089
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:07,870
many common notes served between these maximal cliques and honestly doctor you

1090
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,330
maximal cliques and honestly doctor you will believe it may will be C 1 C 2 C 3

1091
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:13,210
will believe it may will be C 1 C 2 C 3 and

1092
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:13,220


1093
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:37,510
because this is what we okay you know

1094
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:37,520


1095
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:50,950
all right

1096
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:50,960


1097
01:10:50,960 --> 01:11:20,920
okay so in this case obviously this is

1098
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:20,930


1099
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:32,810
it's common to see one instance consistency between the clinics and in

1100
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:34,570
consistency between the clinics and in the way we're going to be computing

1101
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:40,550
the way we're going to be computing marginals if X belongs to C 1 and C 3 it

1102
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:43,280
marginals if X belongs to C 1 and C 3 it also has to belong to any other click

1103
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:50,480
also has to belong to any other click from c1 to c3 via this tree so basically

1104
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,160
from c1 to c3 via this tree so basically we will not be able to propagate

1105
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:57,320
we will not be able to propagate messages from c1 to c2 to c3 because how

1106
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,730
messages from c1 to c2 to c3 because how are you going to propagate messages

1107
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:01,130
are you going to propagate messages about the x3 when this is not a function

1108
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:07,190
about the x3 when this is not a function of X 3 so this property is called the

1109
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:10,190
of X 3 so this property is called the running intersection property okay so if

1110
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:14,340
running intersection property okay so if viable is common to

1111
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:17,460
viable is common to tip breaks but you see for example c1

1112
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:21,720
tip breaks but you see for example c1 and c3 has to be also a fun intermediate

1113
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:26,460
and c3 has to be also a fun intermediate click from c1 to c3 okay now again I

1114
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:29,720
click from c1 to c3 okay now again I mentioned that this is essential for

1115
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:33,390
mentioned that this is essential for maintaining consistency when you

1116
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:36,450
maintaining consistency when you calculate multi notes on this graph I'm

1117
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,840
calculate multi notes on this graph I'm going to actually discuss this in

1118
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:42,560
going to actually discuss this in determined history right but right now

1119
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,090
determined history right but right now this is basically how long's action 3

1120
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:52,130
this is basically how long's action 3 looks like it's not that you need it but

1121
01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:54,600
looks like it's not that you need it but out of the way that people look at this

1122
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,550
out of the way that people look at this algorithms in addition to these great

1123
01:12:56,550 --> 01:13:02,520
algorithms in addition to these great potentials the separators which are

1124
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,200
potentials the separators which are basically the notes of their common

1125
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,520
basically the notes of their common between these marks

1126
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:24,050
between these marks all right so the message passing from

1127
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:24,060


1128
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:29,820
say if c1 is going to send the messages - - that will be information that

1129
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:34,620
- - that will be information that will update with variable only the

1130
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:37,700
will update with variable only the person who is not involving mr. Pareto I

1131
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,870
person who is not involving mr. Pareto I mean you know more and more in Steinmetz

1132
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:41,280
mean you know more and more in Steinmetz about that Schwann when this doesn't

1133
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:54,270
about that Schwann when this doesn't depend on X was trying to try one side

1134
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:56,580
depend on X was trying to try one side to side 3 is basically like if you have

1135
01:13:56,580 --> 01:14:00,720
to side 3 is basically like if you have this graph right you can make your own

1136
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,750
this graph right you can make your own assignment of potentials having evolved

1137
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:06,950
assignment of potentials having evolved such 1x to explain if you have

1138
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:09,900
such 1x to explain if you have protesters of involve X 2 X 3 and

1139
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:13,080
protesters of involve X 2 X 3 and similarly here it's great sports 5 you

1140
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,210
similarly here it's great sports 5 you have choices if you start from a

1141
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:17,040
have choices if you start from a directed graph of how you do this

1142
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,080
directed graph of how you do this assignment but actively whatever

1143
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,229
assignment but actively whatever optimization you have

1144
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:22,630
optimization you have here you can transform this to Taiwan

1145
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:26,350
here you can transform this to Taiwan Cyclops I predefined cupboard over this

1146
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:33,280
Cyclops I predefined cupboard over this mask on trips and history you can use

1147
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,459
mask on trips and history you can use these misses passing away that we have

1148
01:14:36,459 --> 01:14:38,500
these misses passing away that we have seen for priests and now you can do this

1149
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,900
seen for priests and now you can do this injunction treats even though the

1150
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,820
injunction treats even though the original problem had nothing to do with

1151
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:45,820
original problem had nothing to do with please so how do you do this you can

1152
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:47,500
please so how do you do this you can compute the Masters this clixsense

1153
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,220
compute the Masters this clixsense 2 from 1 to 2 and how do you compute is

1154
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:54,670
2 from 1 to 2 and how do you compute is the potential of two extreme 1 and then

1155
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:56,890
the potential of two extreme 1 and then what do you do you integrate X 1 out

1156
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:59,200
what do you do you integrate X 1 out there is no incoming message from any

1157
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,240
there is no incoming message from any part right so this is like the root node

1158
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,459
part right so this is like the root node there is no incoming message so this is

1159
01:15:03,459 --> 01:15:07,750
there is no incoming message so this is n - 1 2 - let me see if there is another

1160
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:10,840
n - 1 2 - let me see if there is another picture if we look at the message from

1161
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,270
picture if we look at the message from day 2 1 obviously I'm going to take this

1162
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:15,970
day 2 1 obviously I'm going to take this potential all right but also there is an

1163
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,770
potential all right but also there is an incoming message from city - -

1164
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:19,720
incoming message from city - - which is that and then you have to

1165
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,940
which is that and then you have to integrate variables that don't belong in

1166
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:24,070
integrate variables that don't belong in the separator that's valuable export so

1167
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:26,709
the separator that's valuable export so you integrate Explorer ok

1168
01:15:26,709 --> 01:15:29,200
you integrate Explorer ok and how do you compute so I can finish

1169
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,290
and how do you compute so I can finish when you finish if you're interested to

1170
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:35,140
when you finish if you're interested to compute the marginals corresponding of

1171
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:37,060
compute the marginals corresponding of the Barnabus X 1 X 2 X 3 corresponding

1172
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:40,150
the Barnabus X 1 X 2 X 3 corresponding to this trick but it is this is the

1173
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:42,820
to this trick but it is this is the local potential sorry 1 times the

1174
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:44,950
local potential sorry 1 times the message that arrives to see one from

1175
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:49,830
message that arrives to see one from City the numbers and if you compute the

1176
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:52,360
City the numbers and if you compute the marginal of X 2 X the export takes the

1177
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,550
marginal of X 2 X the export takes the local potential times the message one

1178
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,350
local potential times the message one sense the to take the message the priest

1179
01:15:56,350 --> 01:16:09,400
sense the to take the message the priest of the two and you're done actually it

1180
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,500
of the two and you're done actually it comes out to be exact

1181
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,330
comes out to be exact if you are using it even when you have

1182
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:16,090
if you are using it even when you have graphs with loops and already we

1183
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:17,740
graphs with loops and already we discussed the algorithm is called the

1184
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,409
discussed the algorithm is called the loopy belief propagation algorithm here

1185
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:25,929
loopy belief propagation algorithm here looks you basically have two there is no

1186
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:28,419
looks you basically have two there is no such a thing as to the message from the

1187
01:16:28,419 --> 01:16:30,009
such a thing as to the message from the neighbors and then propagate them right

1188
01:16:30,009 --> 01:16:32,290
neighbors and then propagate them right because you have loop so what you need

1189
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:35,049
because you have loop so what you need this initialize all this messages to

1190
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:39,639
this initialize all this messages to maybe or something if any values so who

1191
01:16:39,639 --> 01:16:41,199
maybe or something if any values so who cares for sending messages to all the

1192
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:43,000
cares for sending messages to all the other nodes and then you can apply your

1193
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,219
other nodes and then you can apply your classical Esther passing so if you have

1194
01:16:45,219 --> 01:16:47,529
classical Esther passing so if you have the loops the junction tree I would make

1195
01:16:47,529 --> 01:16:50,139
the loops the junction tree I would make work and then lots of time works that if

1196
01:16:50,139 --> 01:16:52,299
work and then lots of time works that if you set the literature there some very

1197
01:16:52,299 --> 01:16:55,419
you set the literature there some very standard pain problems when it it pays

1198
01:16:55,419 --> 01:16:57,189
standard pain problems when it it pays drastically and it doesn't work a lot

1199
01:16:57,189 --> 01:17:00,540
drastically and it doesn't work a lot okay but there's no proofs why it works

1200
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:04,120
okay but there's no proofs why it works when it works but it actually works and

1201
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,569
when it works but it actually works and it works for arbitrary graphs and you

1202
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:09,759
it works for arbitrary graphs and you know and you can make it actually work

1203
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:14,679
know and you can make it actually work exactly okay so 146 the slides will have

1204
01:17:14,679 --> 01:17:16,959
exactly okay so 146 the slides will have a thing that is another example we did

1205
01:17:16,959 --> 01:17:20,500
a thing that is another example we did in maybe giant Satyam the junction tree

1206
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,120
in maybe giant Satyam the junction tree algorithm so when we come back on

1207
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,209
algorithm so when we come back on Tuesday we can finish this general

1208
01:17:25,209 --> 01:17:28,120
Tuesday we can finish this general inference algorithm is from online

1209
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,100
inference algorithm is from online lecture so to make sure you have this

1210
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:44,949
lecture so to make sure you have this transform you okay just reserve two

1211
01:17:44,949 --> 01:17:53,040
transform you okay just reserve two problems by tomorrow so you know what

1212
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:53,050


1213
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:57,879
cetera you can stop by when I'm there usually eat up tonight's the best time

1214
01:17:57,879 --> 01:18:01,090
usually eat up tonight's the best time okay so
