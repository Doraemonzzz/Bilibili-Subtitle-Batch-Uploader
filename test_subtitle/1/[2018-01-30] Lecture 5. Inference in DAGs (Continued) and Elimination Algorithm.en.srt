1
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,289
I bet the dory will open as soon as I stop talking okay let's try it

2
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:08,729
stop talking okay let's try it so 1231 okay you can you count the

3
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,460
so 1231 okay you can you count the seconds when the door will open so the

4
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,330
seconds when the door will open so the main topic today is what is called the

5
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,280
main topic today is what is called the elimination algorithm that sort of we

6
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,280
elimination algorithm that sort of we have sort of seen it with examples up to

7
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,740
have sort of seen it with examples up to now but we're going to try to do it in a

8
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,949
now but we're going to try to do it in a sort of graph theoretic manner but

9
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:28,440
sort of graph theoretic manner but before that I need to cover maybe if you

10
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,210
before that I need to cover maybe if you slice from the previous lecture if you

11
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,339
slice from the previous lecture if you remember we're talking about you see I

12
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:36,860
remember we're talking about you see I was right

13
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,860
was right okay so we are going to talk it was not

14
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,750
okay so we are going to talk it was not about you okay so we're going to talk

15
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,240
about you okay so we're going to talk about examples of actually some of them

16
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,020
about examples of actually some of them we will see in very fine detail so it

17
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:56,430
we will see in very fine detail so it later on said things look weird in the

18
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,650
later on said things look weird in the context of Bayesian inference for gosh

19
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,420
context of Bayesian inference for gosh we have not seen these things we will

20
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,379
we have not seen these things we will come back to those things later on so

21
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,259
come back to those things later on so the example that we already did was one

22
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:10,800
the example that we already did was one of polynomial regression so this

23
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,990
of polynomial regression so this actually just Bayesian linear regression

24
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,849
actually just Bayesian linear regression so we treat the response of the system

25
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:21,890
so we treat the response of the system which is scalar and we call it P to some

26
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,720
which is scalar and we call it P to some polynomial with this coefficients WI

27
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,319
polynomial with this coefficients WI being random variables and we wrote the

28
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,059
being random variables and we wrote the joint probability distribution like that

29
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:33,210
joint probability distribution like that so this is the prior of W and this is

30
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,819
so this is the prior of W and this is the likelihood so if when you W with the

31
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:44,670
the likelihood so if when you W with the probability of here okay and this is in

32
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,409
probability of here okay and this is in its most general form all right where W

33
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,539
its most general form all right where W has the prior on Davi has some height of

34
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:54,960
has the prior on Davi has some height of our meters alpha and this likelihood

35
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,650
our meters alpha and this likelihood model for its input for its W depends on

36
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,479
model for its input for its W depends on some noise variance Sigma square which

37
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,860
some noise variance Sigma square which is not known so this is sort of again in

38
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,490
is not known so this is sort of again in more detail the joint probability of T

39
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,800
more detail the joint probability of T these the response and W of the unknown

40
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,540
these the response and W of the unknown regression coefficients so what we did

41
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,300
regression coefficients so what we did this we introduced this plate notation

42
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:24,390
this we introduced this plate notation and the everything is inside the box

43
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,830
and the everything is inside the box means it is repeating n times so when

44
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,600
means it is repeating n times so when you say you see here you know when you

45
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,190
you say you see here you know when you try to write the joint probability

46
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,600
try to write the joint probability distribution of all the variables on

47
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,240
distribution of all the variables on this model you're going to have the

48
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,360
this model you're going to have the probability of TN given X 10 but now you

49
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,430
probability of TN given X 10 but now you have n of those and that's how you get

50
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,650
have n of those and that's how you get this product and of course you have the

51
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,070
this product and of course you have the probability of W given alpha and alpha

52
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,190
probability of W given alpha and alpha and Sigma square is taken as fixed

53
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,630
and Sigma square is taken as fixed parameters right now so there's no

54
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,120
parameters right now so there's no probability affiliated to them so this

55
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,000
probability affiliated to them so this is the plate notation and when you get

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,210
is the plate notation and when you get expert in this type of things sometimes

57
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,670
expert in this type of things sometimes you will be drawing this book this pixel

58
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,220
you will be drawing this book this pixel sphere and immediately implying this a

59
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,900
sphere and immediately implying this a lot of other writing this and that

60
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,480
lot of other writing this and that saying here is the picture showing the

61
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,150
saying here is the picture showing the distribution okay but it will take some

62
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,610
distribution okay but it will take some time basically to get rain on doing that

63
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,400
time basically to get rain on doing that but in a lots of papers people don't

64
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,650
but in a lots of papers people don't want to do to solve the answer bus or

65
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,900
want to do to solve the answer bus or what they saw is this and that implies

66
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,180
what they saw is this and that implies everything you need to know okay and I

67
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,280
everything you need to know okay and I think we want to extend it first you

68
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
think we want to extend it first you know in the last few seconds of the

69
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,440
know in the last few seconds of the presentation last Thursday to include

70
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,200
presentation last Thursday to include also predictions so this is the joint

71
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,610
also predictions so this is the joint probability distribution of W of the

72
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,730
probability distribution of W of the training data the build is the training

73
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,370
training data the build is the training data corresponding to X ball and also we

74
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,750
data corresponding to X ball and also we have the prediction stick heart

75
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,390
have the prediction stick heart corresponding to X 1/2 so if you try to

76
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,020
corresponding to X 1/2 so if you try to form this joint distribution basically

77
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,380
form this joint distribution basically what you have is this is the posterior

78
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,240
what you have is this is the posterior of W this is what we had before but also

79
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,409
of W this is what we had before but also now you see the light liquid

80
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:07,920
now you see the light liquid corresponding to X hot okay so this is

81
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,130
corresponding to X hot okay so this is the probability of big heart given X hat

82
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,550
the probability of big heart given X hat and given the parameters W Sigma square

83
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,930
and given the parameters W Sigma square and again pictorially we have the same

84
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,110
and again pictorially we have the same thing as before but not what we have

85
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,180
thing as before but not what we have done is we have included a note that

86
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,790
done is we have included a note that will allow us for any text heart to

87
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,559
will allow us for any text heart to figure out what the prediction big heart

88
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:31,570
figure out what the prediction big heart is and you notice this prediction the

89
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,450
is and you notice this prediction the heart depends for next heart it depends

90
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,510
heart depends for next heart it depends from w and it depends on Sigma square so

91
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,219
from w and it depends on Sigma square so the arrows basically is to all the

92
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:42,100
the arrows basically is to all the dependencies that you need to know so

93
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,969
dependencies that you need to know so too extreme is complicated right but on

94
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:48,580
too extreme is complicated right but on the other hand someone would say this is

95
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,640
the other hand someone would say this is complicated already well this

96
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,890
complicated already well this incorporates the full model again if you

97
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,580
incorporates the full model again if you have not seen this problems in the

98
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,230
have not seen this problems in the context of regression it will take you

99
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,749
context of regression it will take you less than 20 minutes to read my

100
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:07,629
less than 20 minutes to read my regression lecture from not semester or

101
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:09,730
regression lecture from not semester or looking at the book like bishops or

102
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,999
looking at the book like bishops or leftist view to get some idea on this

103
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:17,830
leftist view to get some idea on this type of thing

104
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840


105
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,740
that's another progression problem that goes with the name relevance vector

106
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,839
goes with the name relevance vector machines we actually don't believe we

107
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,420
machines we actually don't believe we cover this even in the course last

108
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,540
cover this even in the course last semester but basically a simple idea you

109
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,700
semester but basically a simple idea you it's similar in many ways to the

110
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,520
it's similar in many ways to the previous model but you notice now there

111
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,760
previous model but you notice now there is another plate around the boundary use

112
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,939
is another plate around the boundary use and this hyper parameters alpha they're

113
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:49,899
and this hyper parameters alpha they're inside this plate which means there must

114
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:55,420
inside this plate which means there must be some you that looks like that all

115
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,399
be some you that looks like that all right so this repetition so we have M

116
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,040
right so this repetition so we have M doubly use all right so when you look at

117
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,879
doubly use all right so when you look at this picture

118
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,820
this picture obviously it implies for each of this W

119
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,129
obviously it implies for each of this W eyes I am putting its own prior and

120
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:08,110
eyes I am putting its own prior and effectively they have the same type of

121
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,450
effectively they have the same type of distributions it's a gaussians but the

122
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,070
distributions it's a gaussians but the variance is different and the idea of

123
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,839
variance is different and the idea of these relevant wrestler machines that is

124
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,830
these relevant wrestler machines that is not coming this picture is that somehow

125
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,870
not coming this picture is that somehow when some of the supplies go to

126
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,560
when some of the supplies go to Trinity this distribution picks on zero

127
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,380
Trinity this distribution picks on zero and basically this W to become

128
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,870
and basically this W to become irrelevant in the whole picture so this

129
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,400
irrelevant in the whole picture so this is what this called relevance vector

130
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,440
is what this called relevance vector must change to tells you from all the

131
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,339
must change to tells you from all the input variables which ones are needed to

132
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:42,670
input variables which ones are needed to do predictions so similar to what we had

133
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,089
do predictions so similar to what we had before

134
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,830
before all right again this is the noise

135
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,050
all right again this is the noise variance in the model this is your Sigma

136
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,280
variance in the model this is your Sigma squared

137
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,130
squared but now the W is another plate that

138
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,060
but now the W is another plate that comes outside to introduce this sparsity

139
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,460
comes outside to introduce this sparsity inducing prior model of W so this mobile

140
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,050
inducing prior model of W so this mobile is sort of very simple but very powerful

141
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,600
is sort of very simple but very powerful and allows you to program it actually

142
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,230
and allows you to program it actually literally in the five lines so it's a a

143
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,980
literally in the five lines so it's a a very favorite model if you want to test

144
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,270
very favorite model if you want to test sparsity and do regression this is the

145
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:21,200
sparsity and do regression this is the type of things you want to do

146
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,210


147
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:26,840
on the mean well so basically we just the you know we say let's take this

148
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,670
the you know we say let's take this cigars and write this Gaussian it's

149
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,830
cigars and write this Gaussian it's going to be centered around zero zero

150
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,460
going to be centered around zero zero means the battery is not important okay

151
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,130
means the battery is not important okay and and with some with some confidence

152
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,160
and and with some with some confidence basically defined by this precision of

153
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:52,090
basically defined by this precision of high okay so nothing you know okay

154
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:52,100


155
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,830
and again this plate notation does not show the type of distributions are so

156
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,440
show the type of distributions are so you know if you want from Gaussian to go

157
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,210
you know if you want from Gaussian to go to other no student T distribution

158
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,670
to other no student T distribution something like that at this point you

159
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,620
something like that at this point you can do that as well so this is still a

160
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,030
can do that as well so this is still a bit more generic okay so that's the

161
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:16,000
bit more generic okay so that's the plate rotate we are going to discuss

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,410
plate rotate we are going to discuss we're going to spend maybe a whole week

163
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,770
we're going to spend maybe a whole week on hidden Markov models and state-space

164
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,360
on hidden Markov models and state-space models so you're going to see these

165
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,490
models so you're going to see these things multiple times okay and let me

166
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,460
things multiple times okay and let me I'm gonna play pass this unsupervised

167
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,620
I'm gonna play pass this unsupervised learning problem under the name of

168
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,360
learning problem under the name of Pittsburgh component analysis maybe we

169
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,070
Pittsburgh component analysis maybe we will cover this in a lecture of later on

170
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,850
will cover this in a lecture of later on using you know block of representation

171
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,420
using you know block of representation but then we concentrate on a very hidden

172
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,130
but then we concentrate on a very hidden Markov model called basically all the

173
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,960
Markov model called basically all the variables are discrete or in state-space

174
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,710
variables are discrete or in state-space models which basically they're similar

175
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,640
models which basically they're similar to hidden Markov models but this axis

176
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,020
to hidden Markov models but this axis are continuous variables and the

177
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,090
are continuous variables and the observations Y are also continuous

178
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,060
observations Y are also continuous variables and what I have done here just

179
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,600
variables and what I have done here just so I can sort of make things to look a

180
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,340
so I can sort of make things to look a little complicated are not simply

181
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,830
little complicated are not simply extending this hidden Markov model to a

182
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,200
extending this hidden Markov model to a state space model but I'm explaining it

183
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,330
state space model but I'm explaining it to what is called as reaching safe space

184
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,570
to what is called as reaching safe space water

185
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:27,240
water and again I'm talking where I said you

186
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,949
and again I'm talking where I said you know of the course but you know I want

187
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:31,050
know of the course but you know I want you to see this thing and Beyond so

188
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,860
you to see this thing and Beyond so actively this axis is the human state

189
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,259
actively this axis is the human state similar to what you have there why are

190
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,019
similar to what you have there why are the observations and that's the sort of

191
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,840
the observations and that's the sort of a descriptive variable that tells you if

192
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,670
a descriptive variable that tells you if you think of this representing let's say

193
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:49,620
you think of this representing let's say you know some mixture of models and the

194
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,579
you know some mixture of models and the state let's say s 1 can be 1 2 or 3 in

195
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,110
state let's say s 1 can be 1 2 or 3 in so you can be into the different

196
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,730
so you can be into the different components on the mixture

197
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,730
components on the mixture so this discrete variable S 1 defines

198
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,759
so this discrete variable S 1 defines basically import the evolution of the

199
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,769
basically import the evolution of the dynamical system how you go from x1 to

200
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:07,530
dynamical system how you go from x1 to x2 but also defines the observation how

201
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:12,360
x2 but also defines the observation how you get y1 from X to R ok and here this

202
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,699
you get y1 from X to R ok and here this discrete particle s also evolves the

203
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:16,290
discrete particle s also evolves the same way as we do in a hidden Markov

204
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,139
same way as we do in a hidden Markov model and the human-machine the tempest

205
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,130
model and the human-machine the tempest law sort of forcing the first arrow so

206
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,840
law sort of forcing the first arrow so for example if this is in the robotics

207
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,720
for example if this is in the robotics you know maybe would be some power input

208
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,730
you know maybe would be some power input or some force input torque or something

209
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:33,440
or some force input torque or something like that that you put in the model so

210
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,930
like that that you put in the model so this is the generic thing and this is

211
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,910
this is the generic thing and this is one of the extensions there are infinite

212
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,810
one of the extensions there are infinite books for extensions like that and the

213
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,449
books for extensions like that and the good news are for the bad news for those

214
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:47,910
good news are for the bad news for those doing a PhD is that all of the smallest

215
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,430
doing a PhD is that all of the smallest basically have been addressed 20 years

216
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,760
basically have been addressed 20 years ago ok so they may look complicated but

217
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,590
ago ok so they may look complicated but they are all done deals and actually

218
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,350
they are all done deals and actually they have revolutionized areas from

219
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,670
they have revolutionized areas from robotics to animation to just mention it

220
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,579
robotics to animation to just mention it navigation satellite tracking and all of

221
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,340
navigation satellite tracking and all of these things

222
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,320
these things right from but I'm giving you this is an

223
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,090
right from but I'm giving you this is an example again now what you see here

224
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,830
example again now what you see here we're going to spend more than a week or

225
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,260
we're going to spend more than a week or two later on in the course so what I

226
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,770
two later on in the course so what I wanted to do is say I just wanted to

227
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,050
wanted to do is say I just wanted to show you how meters come in this models

228
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,400
show you how meters come in this models again as a background so what i'm doing

229
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,830
again as a background so what i'm doing here is i'm writing the joint

230
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,260
here is i'm writing the joint probability of x and y in the state

231
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,680
probability of x and y in the state space model explicitly so this is node X

232
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,660
space model explicitly so this is node X 1 so you started with P of X 1 and then

233
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,060
1 so you started with P of X 1 and then P of y 1 given X 1 then P of X 2 given

234
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,150
P of y 1 given X 1 then P of X 2 given x1 and then give right to given X 2 etc

235
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,580
x1 and then give right to given X 2 etc etc all right so these are the hidden

236
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,130
etc all right so these are the hidden States you want to compute these are the

237
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,590
States you want to compute these are the observations you can think of them as

238
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:56,060
observations you can think of them as noisy or you know there are basically

239
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,400
noisy or you know there are basically noisy values of x if you like in some

240
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,230
noisy values of x if you like in some sense if the dynamics and the

241
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,060
sense if the dynamics and the observation models are now seeing this

242
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,560
observation models are now seeing this problem has a very nice analytical

243
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,090
problem has a very nice analytical solution that's what the Kalman filter

244
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:12,650
solution that's what the Kalman filter is all right but you can it can be a

245
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,570
is all right but you can it can be a mixture of gaussians can be anything and

246
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,250
mixture of gaussians can be anything and actually we know how to deal with all of

247
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,440
actually we know how to deal with all of these problems and we will problem these

248
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,420
these problems and we will problem these things later on but this is what I

249
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,650
things later on but this is what I wanted to show you there's more those so

250
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,780
wanted to show you there's more those so when you say dynamics you go from X hat

251
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,840
when you say dynamics you go from X hat minus 1 to X I obviously give that I

252
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,800
minus 1 to X I obviously give that I have to define this distribution and

253
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,590
have to define this distribution and usually the way you will define it it's

254
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,540
usually the way you will define it it's a Gaussian you can have some unknown

255
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,670
a Gaussian you can have some unknown parameters like mean and variance to

256
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,560
parameters like mean and variance to things like that and similarly for the

257
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,970
things like that and similarly for the observation model you're going to have

258
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,150
observation model you're going to have some unknown parameters okay and you

259
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,970
some unknown parameters okay and you know this fear the way that I define the

260
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,400
know this fear the way that I define the state space model is that this parameter

261
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,950
state space model is that this parameter state time this parameters sigh they are

262
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,890
state time this parameters sigh they are stared from other conditional

263
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,200
stared from other conditional distributions across the time so

264
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,520
distributions across the time so basically the parameters that define

265
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,280
basically the parameters that define that say the dynamical model or I go

266
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,790
that say the dynamical model or I go from X 1 to X 2 and X 3 to X 2 X 3

267
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,520
from X 1 to X 2 and X 3 to X 2 X 3 etcetera the parameters PI are the same

268
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,310
etcetera the parameters PI are the same okay so this is sort of where the school

269
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,430
okay so this is sort of where the school vomited rain you know so you use the

270
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,020
vomited rain you know so you use the same parameters to describe the dynamics

271
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,020
same parameters to describe the dynamics and the same parameters to define the

272
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,010
and the same parameters to define the observations obviously not very

273
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,490
observations obviously not very realistic right you can think you know

274
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,470
realistic right you can think you know it's not alive but gross normal emotions

275
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,570
it's not alive but gross normal emotions but something is not accelerating or

276
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,240
but something is not accelerating or something happens it's not spoiling so

277
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,860
something happens it's not spoiling so you don't expect the same dynamics at

278
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,170
you don't expect the same dynamics at all the time so this profit is obviously

279
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,800
all the time so this profit is obviously have to change with time but if you

280
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,810
have to change with time but if you really want a trivial case this is how

281
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,210
really want a trivial case this is how the graphical model would look like ok

282
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,530
the graphical model would look like ok and when I wanted to point on this

283
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,420
and when I wanted to point on this diagram and this is going to attempt to

284
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,180
diagram and this is going to attempt to be a problem later on in the course is

285
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,220
be a problem later on in the course is when you look at this directed graphical

286
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,950
when you look at this directed graphical model it just loops so on one hand you

287
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,570
model it just loops so on one hand you use the same parameters so obviously you

288
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,590
use the same parameters so obviously you save with lots of computation seems like

289
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,150
save with lots of computation seems like you know we will see this one we discuss

290
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,040
you know we will see this one we discuss inference but on the other hand you can

291
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,170
inference but on the other hand you can see there are loops and loops are not

292
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,530
see there are loops and loops are not good for you ok loops are not good for

293
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,410
good for you ok loops are not good for you I mean at least the loops if you

294
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,630
you I mean at least the loops if you remove the arrows right you can see

295
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,240
remove the arrows right you can see there are loops ok and this will create

296
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,880
there are loops ok and this will create it will make inference to leave it more

297
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,960
it will make inference to leave it more expensive than that one ok on the

298
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,370
expensive than that one ok on the state-space models you can have multiple

299
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,640
state-space models you can have multiple chains and you can see an example here

300
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,700
chains and you can see an example here of a factorial state space model so if

301
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,540
of a factorial state space model so if you think that each of these hidden

302
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,180
you think that each of these hidden states on the first chain can take em

303
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,820
states on the first chain can take em values and this can take em values of

304
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,310
values and this can take em values of this prime so you basically have n cube

305
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,130
this prime so you basically have n cube configurations at its time and it comes

306
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,350
configurations at its time and it comes out this is the only message I wanted to

307
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,960
out this is the only message I wanted to show you here is that if you have a

308
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,640
show you here is that if you have a model that looks complicated like that

309
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,980
model that looks complicated like that it actually must cheaper to do inference

310
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,520
it actually must cheaper to do inference than having one chain that has m2 the

311
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,579
than having one chain that has m2 the cube configurations

312
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:15,620
cube configurations all right so here I have my views have

313
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,019
all right so here I have my views have widest possible land values so I have F

314
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:21,289
widest possible land values so I have F to the Q possible States if I talk to

315
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,509
to the Q possible States if I talk to this with one chain only can take em to

316
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,189
this with one chain only can take em to the Q values right

317
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:27,470
the Q values right that's way much more complicated problem

318
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,299
that's way much more complicated problem because he's empty the cube like thing

319
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:34,460
because he's empty the cube like thing and so we will discuss about this

320
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,740
and so we will discuss about this factorial state space model so maybe

321
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,230
factorial state space model so maybe we'll give you a call mode to work on

322
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,649
we'll give you a call mode to work on later on in the course again we will do

323
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:45,139
later on in the course again we will do all the details and inference of them on

324
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:49,460
all the details and inference of them on this type of things maybe in three

325
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,990
this type of things maybe in three lectures or four lectures we'll come

326
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,399
lectures or four lectures we'll come back to his problem alright so I'm going

327
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:59,350
back to his problem alright so I'm going to take the lecture from last week with

328
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,759
to take the lecture from last week with one very specific example of inference

329
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,529
one very specific example of inference when everything in the graph is

330
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:13,669
when everything in the graph is described so what is not described I

331
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:15,620
described so what is not described I have the conditional probability

332
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,000
have the conditional probability distributions but the actual values of

333
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,419
distributions but the actual values of the you know we provide basically

334
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:25,669
the you know we provide basically information data for the actual

335
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:28,370
information data for the actual realizations of random variables in the

336
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,279
realizations of random variables in the nodes of the graph okay and I'm going to

337
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,899
nodes of the graph okay and I'm going to address this problem

338
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:34,970
address this problem not in this slide but the next slide I'm

339
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,950
not in this slide but the next slide I'm going to do an example where all the

340
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,389
going to do an example where all the variables are discrete and I will give

341
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:41,750
variables are discrete and I will give you very specific sort of calculation in

342
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,899
you very specific sort of calculation in in two slides on how things look like so

343
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:50,389
in two slides on how things look like so we have a graph where I have given you

344
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:54,049
we have a graph where I have given you any realization of the nodes of the

345
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,610
any realization of the nodes of the values of the random variables of the

346
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,299
values of the random variables of the nodes so it's realization is over to you

347
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:02,180
nodes so it's realization is over to you or it's no and I give you everybody know

348
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,519
or it's no and I give you everybody know so there is no missing data here all

349
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:08,990
so there is no missing data here all right I describe completely you know for

350
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,639
right I describe completely you know for its higher give you all the baggage of

351
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:16,190
its higher give you all the baggage of excise so the logical of the model so

352
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,840
excise so the logical of the model so the means data here we're going to use

353
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,140
the means data here we're going to use this as a notation in the core

354
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,490
this as a notation in the core people would be the unknown parameters

355
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,159
people would be the unknown parameters that became the conditional

356
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:26,630
that became the conditional distributions in the graph which we

357
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,580
distributions in the graph which we don't know what they are so the

358
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,740
don't know what they are so the likelihood is assuming iid data right is

359
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,789
likelihood is assuming iid data right is the probability of X i given theta x i

360
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:41,240
the probability of X i given theta x i again is the app data cased and evolves

361
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,850
again is the app data cased and evolves all the notes in the graph and then what

362
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,590
all the notes in the graph and then what I do is I use the factorization of the

363
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,250
I do is I use the factorization of the graph to write the probability of X i

364
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,100
graph to write the probability of X i given theta as the power over all nodes

365
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,330
given theta as the power over all nodes of the probability of for the I case of

366
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,940
of the probability of for the I case of no T given its parents and the

367
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,779
no T given its parents and the parameters theta

368
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:05,539
parameters theta nothing can see right in directive jobs

369
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:09,710
nothing can see right in directive jobs right so again the I means that's the

370
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,500
right so again the I means that's the beta case I so you can remove I when you

371
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,510
beta case I so you can remove I when you think of the second term the way we

372
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,240
think of the second term the way we factorized is the property is the

373
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,740
factorized is the property is the product of the probabilities of the

374
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,740
product of the probabilities of the facts that is not given the its parents

375
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,049
facts that is not given the its parents and you have comma the parameters

376
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:25,070
and you have comma the parameters because we don't know where the

377
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,580
because we don't know where the kilometers are so what I'm gonna do now

378
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,409
kilometers are so what I'm gonna do now is I am going to reverse to reverse the

379
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:36,649
is I am going to reverse to reverse the product over the node and the product

380
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:39,680
product over the node and the product over the dataset so I'm going to put the

381
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,370
over the dataset so I'm going to put the product over the data sets inside and

382
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,940
product over the data sets inside and some we have this point of outside and

383
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,930
some we have this point of outside and then the product over the data set even

384
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,090
then the product over the data set even be operating on the probability of XIT

385
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:57,200
be operating on the probability of XIT given the parents for the IPS of T and

386
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,110
given the parents for the IPS of T and the parameters theta and I call this the

387
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,169
the parameters theta and I call this the best associated with the family of node

388
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:06,980
best associated with the family of node P isn't in fact the likelihood of the

389
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,070
P isn't in fact the likelihood of the family

390
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,799
family the likelihood of the data over the

391
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:15,729
the likelihood of the data over the family of no T so if you move this

392
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:17,609
family of no T so if you move this outside right then you put it here

393
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,100
outside right then you put it here product over all the nodes and it here

394
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,159
product over all the nodes and it here this refers to T an exponent so isn't it

395
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,720
this refers to T an exponent so isn't it really the likelihood of the comedy of

396
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,409
really the likelihood of the comedy of know T it only involves the data that

397
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:39,560
know T it only involves the data that have to do with thinnest forest

398
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:39,570


399
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:47,899
who can sit up right so basically when you look at this equation like what does

400
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:49,700
you look at this equation like what does it do what can we say for the level of

401
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:56,109
it do what can we say for the level of likelihood in this formula that is over

402
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:56,119


403
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:04,609
over the notes so even though you have a very complicated diagram right the

404
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:09,710
very complicated diagram right the likelihood okay of the data it arises

405
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,489
likelihood okay of the data it arises over the likelihood you know when I

406
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:15,739
over the likelihood you know when I stayed with the knowledge were in it's

407
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:18,769
stayed with the knowledge were in it's not include the community of that node

408
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:20,930
not include the community of that node because V is the likelihood of the

409
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,299
because V is the likelihood of the family of that know and why is this

410
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:25,909
family of that know and why is this important because it tells you that this

411
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:29,060
important because it tells you that this problem is theta P for each node P can

412
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,700
problem is theta P for each node P can be computed separately for the parameter

413
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,129
be computed separately for the parameter which a pickle people Swan or fitness P

414
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:36,289
which a pickle people Swan or fitness P plus 2 so you can actually compute the

415
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:40,070
plus 2 so you can actually compute the parameters locally for its note because

416
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:45,680
parameters locally for its note because they decouple the way this to be the

417
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,279
they decouple the way this to be the case when you have incomplete data but

418
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,460
case when you have incomplete data but now I do notice if from this equation if

419
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,979
now I do notice if from this equation if you have complete data you get a product

420
00:22:57,979 --> 00:22:59,659
you have complete data you get a product of terms solids

421
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:02,239
of terms solids no okay so the recipe would decompose

422
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:05,359
no okay so the recipe would decompose the quality the graphs left okay and if

423
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,669
the quality the graphs left okay and if you want you know to go blind likelihood

424
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:09,259
you want you know to go blind likelihood then you want to introduce a prior for

425
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:11,389
then you want to introduce a prior for the parameters you can make a simple

426
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,769
the parameters you can make a simple assumption that the prior of the

427
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:14,570
assumption that the prior of the parameter sort support arrives over the

428
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:18,349
parameter sort support arrives over the nodes so basically this makes sense

429
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:21,169
nodes so basically this makes sense right because you the distribution for

430
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:24,409
right because you the distribution for the Rises and you have every conditional

431
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:25,759
the Rises and you have every conditional distribution of leading with a node

432
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,529
distribution of leading with a node having this theta T so you can put a

433
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,810
having this theta T so you can put a prior but loops like that and then the

434
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,349
prior but loops like that and then the posterior

435
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:34,519
posterior Fox arises over notes as well right so

436
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:37,039
Fox arises over notes as well right so if you can do Bayesian inference to

437
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,750
if you can do Bayesian inference to compute theta T RT to note separately

438
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,460
compute theta T RT to note separately I'm going to give you a very specific

439
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,810
I'm going to give you a very specific example soon okay but this to sort of

440
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:51,390
example soon okay but this to sort of equations are extremely important here

441
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:51,400


442
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,730
make any bit of tact this is only when you have complete data describe if there

443
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,440
you have complete data describe if there are missing data this is not the case

444
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,010
are missing data this is not the case all right so you know they said it's a

445
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,350
all right so you know they said it's a different story that we will see later

446
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,240
different story that we will see later on but this is sort of a very trivial

447
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,240
on but this is sort of a very trivial case if you have complete data you can

448
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,390
case if you have complete data you can infer what the parameters are

449
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:17,440
infer what the parameters are by using this decomposition of the

450
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:23,430
by using this decomposition of the posterior detective the over the graph

451
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,440


452
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,720
on the next slide you will see numbers so if you don't understand this example

453
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,159
so if you don't understand this example you will understand hopefully the slides

454
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,590
you will understand hopefully the slides of counseling because it has specific

455
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,390
of counseling because it has specific numbers so let me add some when I

456
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,820
numbers so let me add some when I consider the case where the conditional

457
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,890
consider the case where the conditional probabilities are given in terms of

458
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,080
probabilities are given in terms of tables all right so we're talking about

459
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,430
tables all right so we're talking about discrete variables practically valuable

460
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,950
discrete variables practically valuable to follow a multi newly distribution so

461
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,830
to follow a multi newly distribution so let me see what that word eternal final

462
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,890
let me see what that word eternal final distribution Here I am looking at no T

463
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,490
distribution Here I am looking at no T and I say the probability of the given

464
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:04,030
and I say the probability of the given exponent is a categorical of

465
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,530
exponent is a categorical of multi-annual distribution with

466
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:09,940
multi-annual distribution with parameters theta T C so the subscripts

467
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:14,169
parameters theta T C so the subscripts Elstree have a minute here please we

468
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:16,720
Elstree have a minute here please we know that the looking Syst the value the

469
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,690
know that the looking Syst the value the parents are

470
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:21,700


471
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:30,669
so basically you can thank each other responding to the values of their

472
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:33,340
responding to the values of their parents okay and then what you do is you

473
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,580
parents okay and then what you do is you fit a categorical distribution okay so

474
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,129
fit a categorical distribution okay so the probability of T given its balance

475
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:41,529
the probability of T given its balance being a state C is a categorical

476
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:45,820
being a state C is a categorical distribution and obviously in this

477
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,350
distribution and obviously in this categorical distribution you remember

478
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:51,970
categorical distribution you remember they're going to have an opportunity of

479
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,519
they're going to have an opportunity of State and if you sum over all the stage

480
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:58,299
State and if you sum over all the stage this Thetas there for some to R T

481
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:00,039
this Thetas there for some to R T participate as you basically the

482
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:02,529
participate as you basically the probability of being theta T C 1 is the

483
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:04,289
probability of being theta T C 1 is the probability of being in state 1

484
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:06,490
probability of being in state 1 disappears the probability of being in

485
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,590
disappears the probability of being in state T so if you sum all of this you

486
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:12,279
state T so if you sum all of this you get 1 but remember it appreciates the

487
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,700
get 1 but remember it appreciates the probability of being state K at node 3

488
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,220
probability of being state K at node 3 given that the parents are in state C

489
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,070
given that the parents are in state C right so basically you cannot say I mean

490
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,019
right so basically you cannot say I mean you can't do the modular calculation if

491
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:29,169
you can't do the modular calculation if you want to but here too

492
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:33,369
you want to but here too we're going to the table tell us the

493
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:35,740
we're going to the table tell us the probability of 3 given the state of the

494
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,560
probability of 3 given the state of the parents all right and we pick this with

495
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,029
parents all right and we pick this with a categorical distribution of this

496
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:43,749
a categorical distribution of this parameters with this normalization so

497
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:48,580
parameters with this normalization so let's write this explicitly theta D CK

498
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:53,440
let's write this explicitly theta D CK is the probability P means again 90 okay

499
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,909
is the probability P means again 90 okay we're working at 90

500
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:56,889
we're working at 90 so it's no it has its own conditional

501
00:26:56,889 --> 00:27:00,850
so it's no it has its own conditional probability so p ck is the probability

502
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,820
probability so p ck is the probability that X days it takes the value K when

503
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,029
that X days it takes the value K when the plants can take the monastry the

504
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:08,499
the plants can take the monastry the sequence of the industries here it's

505
00:27:08,499 --> 00:27:10,299
sequence of the industries here it's arbitrary right you could have reverse

506
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:12,669
arbitrary right you could have reverse it so this is the notation used here

507
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:16,149
it so this is the notation used here there is the node K is the value that

508
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:19,899
there is the node K is the value that the XT will take given that the parents

509
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,669
the XT will take given that the parents are in state 3

510
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:23,980
are in state 3 we're going to assume that they're Katy

511
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,629
we're going to assume that they're Katy States for

512
00:27:25,629 --> 00:27:29,199
States for no T we're going to ask you that the

513
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:34,719
no T we're going to ask you that the parents can be at categories of holder

514
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:38,769
parents can be at categories of holder City Sacramento City and City is what is

515
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:41,589
City Sacramento City and City is what is the penny how many parents you have is

516
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:43,989
the penny how many parents you have is the product basically of the states of

517
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:47,109
the product basically of the states of the poverty so tonight has two parents

518
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:49,209
the poverty so tonight has two parents at this point just to polish this just

519
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:53,699
at this point just to polish this just three will be 2 times 3

520
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:53,709


521
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:59,560
okay again I will show you this in a specific example but basically this is

522
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:05,499
specific example but basically this is the the house is discrete distributions

523
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:06,819
the the house is discrete distributions this conditional probabilities are

524
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:10,629
this conditional probabilities are defined using a multi newly or

525
00:28:10,629 --> 00:28:12,789
defined using a multi newly or categorical distribution so what we're

526
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:16,569
categorical distribution so what we're gonna do is and now you know I expect

527
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,629
gonna do is and now you know I expect that at least you have some elementary

528
00:28:19,629 --> 00:28:21,999
that at least you have some elementary understanding of a d-flat distribution

529
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:24,879
understanding of a d-flat distribution if you not send me an e-mail you'll know

530
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:27,519
if you not send me an e-mail you'll know who sent you a few pages from maybe

531
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,159
who sent you a few pages from maybe Bishop's book or make this book to read

532
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,459
Bishop's book or make this book to read whether it's really the distribution is

533
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:36,099
whether it's really the distribution is the the conjugate prior to this multi

534
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:38,560
the the conjugate prior to this multi annually distribution so each of this

535
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,839
annually distribution so each of this parameters they collect the vector that

536
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,729
parameters they collect the vector that involves all these people district a

537
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:44,639
involves all these people district a we're going to put a very clear prior

538
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,169
we're going to put a very clear prior alright and then because they are

539
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:49,749
alright and then because they are conjugate the posterior given the data D

540
00:28:49,749 --> 00:28:52,499
conjugate the posterior given the data D is going to come up to be a vehicular

541
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:58,359
is going to come up to be a vehicular distribution with parameters cannot

542
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:01,089
distribution with parameters cannot deceive defined from the prior plus MT

543
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:04,839
deceive defined from the prior plus MT see where this is a vector right mister

544
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:08,469
see where this is a vector right mister vector and this is a vector and here's

545
00:29:08,469 --> 00:29:10,119
vector and this is a vector and here's the definition of the vector so I want

546
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:12,969
the definition of the vector so I want you to look at it and tell me what this

547
00:29:12,969 --> 00:29:15,989
you to look at it and tell me what this is using common sense language basically

548
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:20,049
is using common sense language basically P is the 90 K is the probability that

549
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,079
P is the 90 K is the probability that declares the body a value of note II can

550
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:27,069
declares the body a value of note II can take assuming that the parents are in in

551
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:30,950
take assuming that the parents are in in state C so what is n p ck

552
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:35,220
state C so what is n p ck in my data set because carol have

553
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,799
in my data set because carol have banished I multiply the likelihood with

554
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:40,169
banished I multiply the likelihood with this prior so what do you think PC case

555
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:42,779
this prior so what do you think PC case and you can look at the patient here is

556
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,720
and you can look at the patient here is the number of times in my data set the

557
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,340
the number of times in my data set the negative is in what state instead of

558
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,039
negative is in what state instead of Terry given that the parents are in

559
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,090
Terry given that the parents are in state C okay so that's the empirical

560
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,029
state C okay so that's the empirical count I mean this is sort of if you

561
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:01,620
count I mean this is sort of if you watch this is brother actually there's

562
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:06,240
watch this is brother actually there's no algebraic just like you know you know

563
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,649
no algebraic just like you know you know so this is sort of the sufficient

564
00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:10,919
so this is sort of the sufficient statistics for this problem so it's a

565
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,440
statistics for this problem so it's a nation of the data scientists indicator

566
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,560
nation of the data scientists indicator function and counts the time senior data

567
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,789
function and counts the time senior data set that no T is in state k given that

568
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:25,919
set that no T is in state k given that it's parents are in state C so the the

569
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,340
it's parents are in state C so the the mean of the distribution the daily

570
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,899
mean of the distribution the daily distribution basically there has if you

571
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:36,149
distribution basically there has if you check on Wikipedia will see what the

572
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:38,730
check on Wikipedia will see what the meanest is for example for this

573
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:44,190
meanest is for example for this distribution is 50 G K divided by the

574
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,619
distribution is 50 G K divided by the summation of alpha T C K prime for all

575
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:48,389
summation of alpha T C K prime for all tape lines so the mean of the

576
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:50,850
tape lines so the mean of the distribution of the posterior comes to

577
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,499
distribution of the posterior comes to be this critical count plus alpha D CK

578
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:59,190
be this critical count plus alpha D CK from the prior and then in the numerator

579
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,680
from the prior and then in the numerator denominator you have this actually

580
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,690
denominator you have this actually should be inside parentheses you know

581
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,850
should be inside parentheses you know even though it's obvious here so this

582
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,549
even though it's obvious here so this whole automation here count over K prime

583
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:16,649
whole automation here count over K prime so if let's say you use an unintended

584
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:19,710
so if let's say you use an unintended clip I or where all the surface are

585
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,519
clip I or where all the surface are equal to one so actively this is sort of

586
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,970
equal to one so actively this is sort of regularization so you just add one in

587
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,430
regularization so you just add one in all the empirical counts so if let's say

588
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,690
all the empirical counts so if let's say foreign state

589
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,180
foreign state you have no measurements universe say

590
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,710
you have no measurements universe say that they would never happen

591
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,200
that they would never happen Swan you make it possible and that's

592
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,779
Swan you make it possible and that's what this thing does it sort of the

593
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:42,669
what this thing does it sort of the histogram is this problem for this type

594
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:50,230
histogram is this problem for this type of prevents well let's see an example so

595
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,799
of prevents well let's see an example so this is so we have a direct block with

596
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:58,299
this is so we have a direct block with five nodes and let's say we get some

597
00:31:58,299 --> 00:31:58,720
five nodes and let's say we get some data

598
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,299
all right and the database will contain the realizations of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5

599
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:40,779
the realizations of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 and we have I am going to I think

600
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:46,360
and we have I am going to I think obviously the binary body motion in this

601
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,730
obviously the binary body motion in this problem of forgot to mention obviously

602
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:52,870
problem of forgot to mention obviously so the process is 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 and

603
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,230
so the process is 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 and Here I am

604
00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:02,320
Here I am counts in my data set where no this is

605
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,049
counts in my data set where no this is what this here is from stage 1 or stage

606
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:08,169
what this here is from stage 1 or stage 0 given that the parts are in state C

607
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:10,330
0 given that the parts are in state C which is defined on the rolls on the

608
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:18,340
which is defined on the rolls on the left hand side you see that ok so let's

609
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,620
left hand side you see that ok so let's look at the case when the parents are at

610
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:25,149
look at the case when the parents are at 1 1 how many times look at the data set

611
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:28,539
1 1 how many times look at the data set when X 2 next year of at 1 how many

612
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:33,610
when X 2 next year of at 1 how many times K the know T the first node is at

613
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:37,230
times K the know T the first node is at 1 so I see one case here and I see two

614
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,590
1 so I see one case here and I see two we do

615
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:40,600


616
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,580
similarly let's see how many times the note

617
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:47,040
note is a k equal to 0 when this is 1 and 1

618
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,270
is a k equal to 0 when this is 1 and 1 the 2 1 1 0 1 okay

619
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:54,540
the 2 1 1 0 1 okay 21 and so we can either they say the

620
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,050
21 and so we can either they say the probability if you don't do this a

621
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,900
probability if you don't do this a priori and you use the MLE estimate the

622
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,450
priori and you use the MLE estimate the probability let's say or v pc k equal to

623
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:07,470
probability let's say or v pc k equal to 1 I mean I should actually I hope I

624
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,240
1 I mean I should actually I hope I don't confuse you care what I mean 350

625
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,190
don't confuse you care what I mean 350 see k equal to 1 I mean pick up this G 1

626
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,900
see k equal to 1 I mean pick up this G 1 that's what I mean okay so the

627
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,020
that's what I mean okay so the probability of P that is T 1 the mean

628
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,169
probability of P that is T 1 the mean value if you don't do if you don't put

629
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:24,870
value if you don't do if you don't put any prior will be let's say 2 divided by

630
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,780
any prior will be let's say 2 divided by 3 but remember we have to add on the

631
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,940
3 but remember we have to add on the previous diagram if we use the clave

632
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,350
previous diagram if we use the clave distributions prior with coefficient 1

633
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:37,380
distributions prior with coefficient 1 we have to add 1 to the counts so it

634
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,890
we have to add 1 to the counts so it will be 3 divided by 5 and here will be

635
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:44,150
will be 3 divided by 5 and here will be 1 plus 1 2 divided by 5

636
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:48,869
1 plus 1 2 divided by 5 alright

637
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:48,879


638
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:58,500
obviously the variables are discrete you know so such a complicated but in

639
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,210
know so such a complicated but in essence you know even if the

640
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:03,539
essence you know even if the distributions were Gaussian or there are

641
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:05,490
distributions were Gaussian or there are something else you can do stimuli to

642
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:09,750
something else you can do stimuli to ideas you know and and do full Bayesian

643
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,529
ideas you know and and do full Bayesian analysis to compute the the parameters

644
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:19,140
analysis to compute the the parameters in the conditional distribution now in

645
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,789
in the conditional distribution now in currency girls right you don't know

646
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:23,279
currency girls right you don't know usually other nodes you know you have

647
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:25,349
usually other nodes you know you have personal data so you know some things

648
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:27,150
personal data so you know some things you don't know all the things so this

649
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,500
you don't know all the things so this could be the real problem we have to

650
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,410
could be the real problem we have to deal in this class but if your complete

651
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:36,630
deal in this class but if your complete data it's an easy problem and actually

652
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,529
data it's an easy problem and actually you know if products for example who use

653
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:43,020
you know if products for example who use simulation to generate a lots of data

654
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,240
simulation to generate a lots of data and then they fit these two models you

655
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,579
and then they fit these two models you know you may have the case indeed what

656
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:48,960
know you may have the case indeed what you described in the graph

657
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,180
you described in the graph you know everything or item karakuri

658
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,289
you know everything or item karakuri resistance so you can use this type of

659
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:58,859
resistance so you can use this type of organization so let me drink some coffee

660
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:05,200
organization so let me drink some coffee and then we change subject

661
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,210


662
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:10,089
today I fitted up the Starbucks because they told me that coffee went up to

663
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:13,150
they told me that coffee went up to three or five and I said since when

664
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,309
three or five and I said since when because I was there yesterday then they

665
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:17,589
because I was there yesterday then they said to me are you kiddin and I said of

666
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:25,820
said to me are you kiddin and I said of course then to 95

667
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:25,830


668
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:31,220
so you know maybe tomorrow you guys give me go around your student card so I can

669
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,670
me go around your student card so I can hit it you know and get my discount what

670
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:39,340
hit it you know and get my discount what is that it's like discrimination is it

671
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:39,350


672
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:55,820
I'm going to see me again they asked you on the scooter basically three things we

673
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,500
on the scooter basically three things we already have seen and then try to

674
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:04,310
already have seen and then try to introduce some concepts but we make the

675
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,670
introduce some concepts but we make the elimination over basically easily to

676
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:16,160
elimination over basically easily to program I'm gonna do something sort of a

677
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,830
program I'm gonna do something sort of a little bit stupid but you know we're all

678
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,820
little bit stupid but you know we're all mature so you know I'm gonna bring maybe

679
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,750
mature so you know I'm gonna bring maybe if not today

680
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,230
if not today on on Thursday one shouldn't directed by

681
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:30,080
on on Thursday one shouldn't directed by really discussing some details because I

682
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,150
really discussing some details because I don't want to split this lecture on

683
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,220
don't want to split this lecture on directed graphs and then three weeks

684
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,630
directed graphs and then three weeks later tell you the same things from

685
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,360
later tell you the same things from directed ok so I'm gonna sit in some

686
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,710
directed ok so I'm gonna sit in some information that you need to know about

687
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,500
information that you need to know about undirected graphs and discuss this

688
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:54,890
undirected graphs and discuss this elimination algorithm you can he'll

689
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:58,130
elimination algorithm you can he'll think of some notes that would describe

690
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,310
think of some notes that would describe them so this is bolded Aryan these are

691
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:06,170
them so this is bolded Aryan these are the evidence no notes these are the

692
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,230
the evidence no notes these are the query nodes right this is what you want

693
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,120
query nodes right this is what you want to compute and there are some hidden

694
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,650
to compute and there are some hidden notes and you know if you want to

695
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,600
notes and you know if you want to complete them you can complete them but

696
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,740
complete them you can complete them but here what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

697
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,750
here what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna quite hidden noise because you don't

698
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:22,250
quite hidden noise because you don't care about all right so actively this is

699
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:25,910
care about all right so actively this is your Q K X 1 given X ticks and you can

700
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:28,250
your Q K X 1 given X ticks and you can all of this knows that you don't know so

701
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,020
all of this knows that you don't know so what you need to do is integrate them

702
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,569
what you need to do is integrate them out and I think we already have

703
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:34,670
out and I think we already have discussed that the big picture basically

704
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,740
discussed that the big picture basically looks like the equation you see on the

705
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,160
looks like the equation you see on the on the bottle alright so we want to

706
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,470
on the bottle alright so we want to compute the probability of X hath given

707
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:46,849
compute the probability of X hath given the X the evidence and I write this as

708
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:50,109
the X the evidence and I write this as the joint probability of X F and X T and

709
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:53,180
the joint probability of X F and X T and that probability can be written as all

710
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,339
that probability can be written as all the probability of all the joint all the

711
00:38:55,339 --> 00:38:57,260
the probability of all the joint all the body moves with the hidden variables

712
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,870
body moves with the hidden variables integrated valve and then here you have

713
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,210
integrated valve and then here you have the probability of ecstasy which means

714
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,130
the probability of ecstasy which means it will have to the joint with excel

715
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,599
it will have to the joint with excel four exits integrated out remember that

716
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,270
four exits integrated out remember that nothing fancy really may be the rotation

717
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,190
nothing fancy really may be the rotation is slightly different right so that we

718
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,690
is slightly different right so that we need to know this is what the

719
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,970
need to know this is what the elimination algorithm is how can we use

720
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,789
elimination algorithm is how can we use of the product theoretic ideas to do

721
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:22,549
of the product theoretic ideas to do this effectively and and I think in some

722
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:24,200
this effectively and and I think in some of the examples we have highlighted this

723
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,230
of the examples we have highlighted this but hopefully today if we managed to

724
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,230
but hopefully today if we managed to finish this we will see some ideas have

725
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,690
finish this we will see some ideas have some graphs don't need absolutist so me

726
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:37,039
some graphs don't need absolutist so me tell you what the idea is here is we're

727
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,960
tell you what the idea is here is we're going to use the distribution law when

728
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,289
going to use the distribution law when we do these summations and so you know I

729
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:46,819
we do these summations and so you know I give you here an example you have the

730
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:50,289
give you here an example you have the summation of some constant times X I

731
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:53,299
summation of some constant times X I obviously you can move that constant R

732
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:56,660
obviously you can move that constant R far out and say alpha times Sigma X I so

733
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,390
far out and say alpha times Sigma X I so that's one of the compilations were

734
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,420
that's one of the compilations were going to use and in a more general sense

735
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,650
going to use and in a more general sense if we have summation on you know think

736
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:09,620
if we have summation on you know think of these discrete variables on the x1 xn

737
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:17,120
of these discrete variables on the x1 xn and inside we have alpha 1 X 1 over 2 X

738
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,770
and inside we have alpha 1 X 1 over 2 X 2 etcetera

739
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,870
2 etcetera look what I have done I took this

740
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,539
look what I have done I took this product and I split them in pieces and

741
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:27,319
product and I split them in pieces and then I pushed on with the summations so

742
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:29,150
then I pushed on with the summations so each of them operates only on the right

743
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,270
each of them operates only on the right argument so if I want to start on extend

744
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:32,930
argument so if I want to start on extend which

745
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,480
which the point of having the whole number can

746
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,760
the point of having the whole number can save groans time on extender for product

747
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,400
save groans time on extender for product where an X n it only appears from the

748
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,960
where an X n it only appears from the federal time xn all right so I have what

749
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,290
federal time xn all right so I have what you do this if you push xn all the way

750
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,569
you do this if you push xn all the way in so you could use this then you

751
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:52,700
in so you could use this then you compute the summation xn minus 1 and

752
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,800
compute the summation xn minus 1 and then eventually you compute the

753
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,980
then eventually you compute the sturbation on xn so the idea is what you

754
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,230
sturbation on xn so the idea is what you see here for performing this summation

755
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,930
see here for performing this summation that effectively will allow us to

756
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,050
that effectively will allow us to effectively do this marginalization all

757
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,170
effectively do this marginalization all right this is what the objective is we

758
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:12,410
right this is what the objective is we you know say this are two of their

759
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:17,450
you know say this are two of their cumulative rings but basically together

760
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,010
cumulative rings but basically together with the operations plus and

761
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,079
with the operations plus and multiplication so this is the

762
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,980
multiplication so this is the associative commutative law effectively

763
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:28,309
associative commutative law effectively generalizing for this elements a b c and

764
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:30,980
generalizing for this elements a b c and this commutative ring this property that

765
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,170
this commutative ring this property that you see here this is sort of what we

766
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:38,120
you see here this is sort of what we take advantage okay so for any ABN stick

767
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,530
take advantage okay so for any ABN stick where we can do this

768
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,470
where we can do this so the this one have to be discreet

769
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,390
so the this one have to be discreet mahalo which can be continuous can be

770
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,660
mahalo which can be continuous can be you know other weird things okay this

771
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,630
you know other weird things okay this property if it is valid then we can

772
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,870
property if it is valid then we can apply this this idea for computing

773
00:41:53,870 --> 00:42:02,960
apply this this idea for computing modulation processors okay

774
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:02,970


775
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:09,090
now obviously we want to find an effective way for doing the summations

776
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:12,870
effective way for doing the summations because let me see if there is account

777
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:16,950
because let me see if there is account here if you let's say that if you want

778
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:21,120
here if you let's say that if you want to some so in this case the same we want

779
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,130
to some so in this case the same we want to somehow this hidden variable solve

780
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:27,090
to somehow this hidden variable solve okay so let's call them the total number

781
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:29,760
okay so let's call them the total number of hidden variables is is Billis all

782
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,800
of hidden variables is is Billis all right so obviously the summation of the

783
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,780
right so obviously the summation of the hidden variables will result in the

784
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,850
hidden variables will result in the computation which will be after this

785
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:39,510
computation which will be after this power for either the number of possible

786
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:43,440
power for either the number of possible values that this monomers can take or

787
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,050
values that this monomers can take or actually ever have to some dissipation

788
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,630
actually ever have to some dissipation values there are personal values of this

789
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,070
values there are personal values of this and for each of this they have monster

790
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,780
and for each of this they have monster one serve out and they are possible of a

791
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,150
one serve out and they are possible of a list of that so we are to the power

792
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,980
list of that so we are to the power rates and I'm not the kind of thing that

793
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,890
rates and I'm not the kind of thing that you will need to do this marginalization

794
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,960
you will need to do this marginalization for each module itself the of the

795
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,230
for each module itself the of the grantee body works okay but this is for

796
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,090
grantee body works okay but this is for the big graph this is a big number and

797
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,270
the big graph this is a big number and we don't like it it will not be

798
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:14,940
we don't like it it will not be efficient to do marginalization right so

799
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:22,070
efficient to do marginalization right so let's discuss this in star algorithm

800
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:22,080


801
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:32,630
so we have a better to go and let's say if we want to we want to do much an

802
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,040
if we want to we want to do much an unsession or no deck 6

803
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:39,470
unsession or no deck 6 ok so what we want to do so if you can

804
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:42,680
ok so what we want to do so if you can do this in an aviary right so this

805
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,540
do this in an aviary right so this summation would be six operations well

806
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,410
summation would be six operations well I'm sorry

807
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,840
I'm sorry six operations if this takes on the

808
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,260
six operations if this takes on the values the summation onyx 6 will be our

809
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,600
values the summation onyx 6 will be our operations for each of the other values

810
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,520
operations for each of the other values of this and this and this and this will

811
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,590
of this and this and this and this will be a total basically for to the six

812
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:03,260
be a total basically for to the six operation ok so let's see a way that

813
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:06,230
operation ok so let's see a way that this way white zipper in performing this

814
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,240
this way white zipper in performing this what we don't do up to the six

815
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,790
what we don't do up to the six operations so what I have done here is I

816
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:13,130
operations so what I have done here is I wrote the factorization of the golf

817
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:17,120
wrote the factorization of the golf right the effects 1 x2 given x1 x3 given

818
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,630
right the effects 1 x2 given x1 x3 given X 2 X 5 given the power that 3x tix

819
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:24,320
X 2 X 5 given the power that 3x tix given its parents etc and then when I

820
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,030
given its parents etc and then when I have done is like this the summation on

821
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,120
have done is like this the summation on X takes all the way to the right because

822
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,810
X takes all the way to the right because that's the only place 4 X 6 counts and

823
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:34,310
that's the only place 4 X 6 counts and the summation of this distribution is

824
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:38,030
the summation of this distribution is actually equal to 1 because it's a body

825
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:39,410
actually equal to 1 because it's a body conditional distribution that is

826
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,450
conditional distribution that is normalized so how much handsome I have

827
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:45,290
normalized so how much handsome I have to do 0 nothing so if you actually do

828
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:47,180
to do 0 nothing so if you actually do this you will find yourselves doing

829
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,580
this you will find yourselves doing after the 6th when this actually

830
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:59,650
after the 6th when this actually requires ok it is shown right maybe this

831
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:02,960
requires ok it is shown right maybe this it is it is not one which is something

832
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,890
it is it is not one which is something else here and if he has 3 arguments the

833
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:09,350
else here and if he has 3 arguments the doing the summation will be out to a

834
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:13,130
doing the summation will be out to a power which is way better than out to

835
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:13,850
power which is way better than out to the sixth power

836
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:15,950
the sixth power ok so this is what we need to take

837
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,070
ok so this is what we need to take advantage

838
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:20,020
advantage like there's a lot of a sell-off and

839
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,510
like there's a lot of a sell-off and actually remind me I'm going to send you

840
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:25,480
actually remind me I'm going to send you a copy of absorbance chapter to read

841
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,580
a copy of absorbance chapter to read this book where I extracted this big

842
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,490
this book where I extracted this big sirs okay so if I forget to do that not

843
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:34,950
sirs okay so if I forget to do that not me because the before I go home today so

844
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,960
me because the before I go home today so so again the same problem we want to

845
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,480
so again the same problem we want to compute no we want to compute a

846
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,790
compute no we want to compute a summation with a spectrum of Pi it's

847
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:46,720
summation with a spectrum of Pi it's more interesting okay so what I do is I

848
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,900
more interesting okay so what I do is I take the joint but it's factorize like

849
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,120
take the joint but it's factorize like this and then I am pushing the summation

850
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,380
this and then I am pushing the summation or X 5 to the right to include only the

851
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,780
or X 5 to the right to include only the terms that depend on X 5 and you notice

852
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:01,720
terms that depend on X 5 and you notice I have included X Y given X 3 all right

853
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,050
I have included X Y given X 3 all right but x6 given also it's part of the

854
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:07,930
but x6 given also it's part of the experience part ok so I have to perform

855
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,720
experience part ok so I have to perform a summation of this term and we're going

856
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,280
a summation of this term and we're going to call this a new potential we're going

857
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,200
to call this a new potential we're going to give it some name and I'm going to

858
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,780
to give it some name and I'm going to call the potential P and I'm going to

859
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,920
call the potential P and I'm going to put a subscript X 5 so X 5 reminds me

860
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,570
put a subscript X 5 so X 5 reminds me with snow that destination the tree

861
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:31,150
with snow that destination the tree which male is going to be eliminated

862
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:33,430
which male is going to be eliminated okay expiry is to know that I'm doing

863
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,100
okay expiry is to know that I'm doing the summation and when you sell on X 5

864
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,350
the summation and when you sell on X 5 what your master is the potential is

865
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:41,140
what your master is the potential is going to be a function of X 2 or X 3 and

866
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:44,800
going to be a function of X 2 or X 3 and X 6 so if you live there the arguments

867
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,720
X 6 so if you live there the arguments that you haven't thought the rest of you

868
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,290
that you haven't thought the rest of you saw basically whatever your Psalm is

869
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:51,730
saw basically whatever your Psalm is going to come as a substrate from this

870
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:57,970
going to come as a substrate from this potential okay so let's I have say so

871
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:01,120
potential okay so let's I have say so business the original graph and it tells

872
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,310
business the original graph and it tells you all the conditional probabilities

873
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:05,110
you all the conditional probabilities that define the distributions in this

874
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:08,290
that define the distributions in this graph you notice this is X 3 given X 1 X

875
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,960
graph you notice this is X 3 given X 1 X 5 and X 3 but here you have to parent so

876
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,130
5 and X 3 but here you have to parent so this is a table exit given X 2 and X 5

877
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:22,940
this is a table exit given X 2 and X 5 the three dimensional table in here

878
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,190
the three dimensional table in here let's you know figure out where the hell

879
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,940
let's you know figure out where the hell this graph says why he has this color

880
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,740
this graph says why he has this color when writing the biggest summation X 5

881
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,490
when writing the biggest summation X 5 and the little X 5 but notice what

882
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:38,700
and the little X 5 but notice what happens now x3 and x6 are coming

883
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:44,160
happens now x3 and x6 are coming together in a culture which means that

884
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,010
together in a culture which means that they're correlated now so I have to do

885
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:53,250
they're correlated now so I have to do wipe to them I mean I see here X 3 and X

886
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:58,309
wipe to them I mean I see here X 3 and X 6 X 6 they're coming together

887
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:58,319


888
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:09,620
missus eliminated I'm gonna have to connect basically X 3 and X 2 X 6

889
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:09,630


890
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:19,140
discussing anything yet in the context of the population here given explain

891
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,569
of the population here given explain this you know when I do a summation this

892
00:48:21,569 --> 00:48:23,760
this you know when I do a summation this table will not exist anymore

893
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,569
table will not exist anymore this is the table effect sticks given X

894
00:48:27,569 --> 00:48:28,740
this is the table effect sticks given X 2 and X 5

895
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,760
2 and X 5 when I integrate X 5 this will be the

896
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,180
when I integrate X 5 this will be the summation of this X 5 component will

897
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,069
summation of this X 5 component will disappear and effectively this

898
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:39,630
disappear and effectively this three-dimensional tape will become

899
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:45,690
three-dimensional tape will become actually 2 dimension table okay you will

900
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,059
actually 2 dimension table okay you will be getting this potential here that is

901
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:52,230
be getting this potential here that is declining in terms of this prefix given

902
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:57,630
declining in terms of this prefix given extreme all right okay multiplied by P

903
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:01,980
extreme all right okay multiplied by P of X 6 given what is that X 5 and X 2

904
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:07,809
of X 6 given what is that X 5 and X 2 summation X 5 and then I get this

905
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:07,819


906
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:13,339
so generally the subscript I to put on these potentials is the note that you're

907
00:49:13,339 --> 00:49:15,730
these potentials is the note that you're eliminated or you are signing over and

908
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:19,520
eliminated or you are signing over and excess hi are the dependent variables of

909
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,180
excess hi are the dependent variables of come together in the new potential okay

910
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,470
come together in the new potential okay the way that you thought was basically a

911
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:27,410
the way that you thought was basically a comment in our case because X 2 X 3 and

912
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:34,490
comment in our case because X 2 X 3 and X X's all right so let's have seen on

913
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,859
X X's all right so let's have seen on this area notice elimination of

914
00:49:36,859 --> 00:49:38,920
this area notice elimination of variables

915
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,180
variables elimination are good so this types begin

916
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,390
elimination are good so this types begin out exactly what's going on here so

917
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:48,559
out exactly what's going on here so let's do the marginalization for what

918
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,400
let's do the marginalization for what interested in theta X 1 X 2 only so we

919
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,309
interested in theta X 1 X 2 only so we need to sum on X 3 X 4 X 5 at 6:00

920
00:49:55,309 --> 00:49:58,730
need to sum on X 3 X 4 X 5 at 6:00 so I'm going to do the summations one

921
00:49:58,730 --> 00:49:59,630
so I'm going to do the summations one term at the time

922
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,390
term at the time starting from the leaves all the way up

923
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:03,980
starting from the leaves all the way up to X 3 all right

924
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,690
to X 3 all right and then we will see what happens to the

925
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:11,480
and then we will see what happens to the down so I leave X 2 X 4 2 X 5 here and I

926
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,430
down so I leave X 2 X 4 2 X 5 here and I do a summation on X 6 so when I stand on

927
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,180
do a summation on X 6 so when I stand on its sixth

928
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,299
its sixth alright obviously the Novik sixth will

929
00:50:20,299 --> 00:50:24,470
alright obviously the Novik sixth will disappear now this is equal to 1 right

930
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:27,309
disappear now this is equal to 1 right but let's forget that it is equal to 1

931
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:31,370
but let's forget that it is equal to 1 this will give me a potential that I do

932
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,559
this will give me a potential that I do not play would subscribe that 6 because

933
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:36,200
not play would subscribe that 6 because this is the north of the song and the

934
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,990
this is the north of the song and the available selects will expire so I am

935
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:42,559
available selects will expire so I am giving you so I am going to eliminate

936
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,589
giving you so I am going to eliminate now that X 6 all right and notice there

937
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:48,680
now that X 6 all right and notice there is a dotted line there what is the

938
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,560
is a dotted line there what is the dotted line implies here

939
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:53,570


940
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:58,540
so here have displayed the new potential leads by reverse two and five and that's

941
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:01,260
leads by reverse two and five and that's what I do in the belly I basically say

942
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:07,060
what I do in the belly I basically say 35 are now linked together all right

943
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:07,070


944
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:11,050
an additional step at the time so this is a dotted line but you would see now

945
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:13,480
is a dotted line but you would see now in the next step I am going to make this

946
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,400
in the next step I am going to make this just a back line as well so it doesn't

947
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,830
just a back line as well so it doesn't you know my first oh here it is this

948
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:21,000
you know my first oh here it is this picture and it's gonna be summation on

949
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,230
picture and it's gonna be summation on on the so become the destination xx6

950
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,960
on the so become the destination xx6 we got the potential that depends on X 2

951
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,540
we got the potential that depends on X 2 X 5 and I am going to try and X Prime

952
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:34,180
X 5 and I am going to try and X Prime and the summation X 5 is gonna operate

953
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:40,320
and the summation X 5 is gonna operate on this x naught so on this x naught and

954
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,210
on this x naught so on this x naught and the new potential will have a subscript

955
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:46,210
the new potential will have a subscript X 5 because that's what I saw and what

956
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:49,150
X 5 because that's what I saw and what is left X 2 and X 3 and what am i doing

957
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:49,840
is left X 2 and X 3 and what am i doing that

958
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,170
that I'm connecting X 2 and X 3 all right and

959
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:56,110
I'm connecting X 2 and X 3 all right and then I would get rid of note 5 leading

960
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:02,910
then I would get rid of note 5 leading to this ok all right so let's continue

961
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:10,320
to this ok all right so let's continue eliminate now if I eliminate there is no

962
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,040
eliminate now if I eliminate there is no dependencies that I have to worry

963
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,290
dependencies that I have to worry actually this summation comes here to be

964
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:17,140
actually this summation comes here to be equal to 1 so this potential is equal to

965
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,600
equal to 1 so this potential is equal to 1 so this is eliminated I get a graph

966
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,940
1 so this is eliminated I get a graph like that and then if I get rid of for

967
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:30,610
like that and then if I get rid of for node 3 all right so now 3 there were

968
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:32,560
node 3 all right so now 3 there were sort of offenses that have generated in

969
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,320
sort of offenses that have generated in in between rights or node 3 I have

970
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,480
in between rights or node 3 I have expletive an X 1 but they have a

971
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,360
expletive an X 1 but they have a potential to expand that is a function

972
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,350
potential to expand that is a function of X 2 and X 3

973
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:44,590
of X 2 and X 3 remember all right the function of X 2

974
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:47,920
remember all right the function of X 2 and X 3 and and also have this potential

975
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,530
and X 3 and and also have this potential here with the function of X 2 it's equal

976
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:52,900
here with the function of X 2 it's equal to 1 but here we just keep it for

977
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,960
to 1 but here we just keep it for decoration purposes why are we

978
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,130
decoration purposes why are we and and so we have basically given X Ron

979
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:04,060
and and so we have basically given X Ron no actually I don't keep it the x 1 x 2

980
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:08,260
no actually I don't keep it the x 1 x 2 x 5 of X 2 and X 3 by 7 X 3 and then

981
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,690
x 5 of X 2 and X 3 by 7 X 3 and then what this mask is something depends on

982
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:14,470
what this mask is something depends on your x1 and x2 okay and this is

983
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:18,040
your x1 and x2 okay and this is basically my marginal distribution that

984
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,020
basically my marginal distribution that I going to compute so the margin

985
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,110
I going to compute so the margin distribution is P of X 1 P of x2 given X

986
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:26,230
distribution is P of X 1 P of x2 given X 1 and 2 potentials one depends on Xtreme

987
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:29,980
1 and 2 potentials one depends on Xtreme Ian one depends on X 1 and X 2 and this

988
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:33,610
Ian one depends on X 1 and X 2 and this again the subscripts telling me the

989
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:37,660
again the subscripts telling me the notes that the software eliminated as

990
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:44,830
notes that the software eliminated as they was proceeding okay so this make

991
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,420
they was proceeding okay so this make any sense

992
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:59,380
any sense all right okay so right but when you

993
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,320
all right okay so right but when you know whether we started this this dance

994
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,610
know whether we started this this dance here obviously the first the highest

995
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,370
here obviously the first the highest cost in the calculation is the one that

996
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:12,900
cost in the calculation is the one that involves basically the highest number of

997
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:18,220
involves basically the highest number of variables in in in this summation so for

998
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,830
variables in in in this summation so for example you have two variables so the

999
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:22,300
example you have two variables so the first of this if each of them can take

1000
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,900
first of this if each of them can take our values will be R square right for

1001
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,980
our values will be R square right for each 9 FX 3 here 2 is only two variables

1002
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:34,870
each 9 FX 3 here 2 is only two variables and here I have two variables and shall

1003
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:39,430
and here I have two variables and shall have my so this calculation of this

1004
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:41,830
have my so this calculation of this potential will be basically the most

1005
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:45,250
potential will be basically the most expensive in the process and exactly the

1006
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:51,670
expensive in the process and exactly the nature you can actually you know you

1007
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:54,870
nature you can actually you know you will see later on when we talk about

1008
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:59,930
will see later on when we talk about laughs basically without this knowledge

1009
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,819
laughs basically without this knowledge determine the maximum click on the

1010
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:04,620
determine the maximum click on the corresponding undirected graph as I do

1011
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:08,430
corresponding undirected graph as I do this elimination process okay so I'm

1012
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,700
this elimination process okay so I'm gonna start to get shortly okay but I

1013
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,430
gonna start to get shortly okay but I just want you to appreciate that maybe

1014
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:15,990
just want you to appreciate that maybe you hear sound you have three variables

1015
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:19,230
you hear sound you have three variables and you want to sound 1 X 5 for each of

1016
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,819
and you want to sound 1 X 5 for each of the values of this Revati much so this

1017
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:23,130
the values of this Revati much so this is for the highest fastest alright so

1018
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:27,170
is for the highest fastest alright so this will define the cost of the output

1019
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:33,440
this will define the cost of the output this is nice

1020
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:33,450


1021
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:41,670
how important is the way you start when you start doing this elimination right

1022
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:44,009
you start doing this elimination right you can stop how many know but if you do

1023
00:55:44,009 --> 00:55:46,769
you can stop how many know but if you do only you can take the trivial problem

1024
00:55:46,769 --> 00:55:49,680
only you can take the trivial problem and make it very painful so here is a

1025
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,390
and make it very painful so here is a problem let's say if you have all of

1026
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,519
problem let's say if you have all of these variables and somebody tells you

1027
00:55:53,519 --> 00:56:02,069
these variables and somebody tells you you want to compute let's see let's say

1028
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:04,499
you want to compute let's see let's say you want to I don't know what you want

1029
00:56:04,499 --> 00:56:05,880
you want to I don't know what you want to compute of the earth right but let's

1030
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,819
to compute of the earth right but let's say we want to eliminate X 1 ok first

1031
00:56:10,819 --> 00:56:13,380
say we want to eliminate X 1 ok first right maybe you have some evidence and

1032
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,599
right maybe you have some evidence and you want to start doing elimination from

1033
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,999
you want to start doing elimination from X 1 if you eliminate the trial what

1034
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:23,339
X 1 if you eliminate the trial what happens I mean I think actually the

1035
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,140
happens I mean I think actually the joint probability distribution for miles

1036
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,329
joint probability distribution for miles on the graph right if you do militates

1037
00:56:27,329 --> 00:56:32,540
on the graph right if you do militates one first what's going on

1038
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:32,550


1039
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:39,470
show the dependencies now will be between party all while it was depend on

1040
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:42,380
between party all while it was depend on everything else good luck you took

1041
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,450
everything else good luck you took something that sort of was not looking

1042
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:46,910
something that sort of was not looking bad and now we have a graph that it's

1043
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:53,050
bad and now we have a graph that it's pretty connected all right number and

1044
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:55,370
pretty connected all right number and obviously you have to program this ideas

1045
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,080
obviously you have to program this ideas right so because you cannot read say

1046
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,660
right so because you cannot read say what a nice do not move this and do that

1047
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,940
what a nice do not move this and do that because you know it's just visually you

1048
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,130
because you know it's just visually you won't be able to see what's going on so

1049
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,110
won't be able to see what's going on so certainly this is really not but look

1050
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:08,630
certainly this is really not but look what happens if I go eliminated sorry X

1051
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:11,480
what happens if I go eliminated sorry X 3 X 3 basically introduces no additional

1052
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,150
3 X 3 basically introduces no additional dependencies because the X 3 comes only

1053
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:15,950
dependencies because the X 3 comes only in the probability of X 3 given X 1

1054
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:20,120
in the probability of X 3 given X 1 which is equal to 1 so nothing right ok

1055
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,560
which is equal to 1 so nothing right ok nice

1056
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:23,570


1057
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:29,570
all right so remember to web to this elimination algorithm to formally stated

1058
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:32,420
elimination algorithm to formally stated so let me this is sort of actually for

1059
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:35,060
so let me this is sort of actually for decoration reasons this evidence

1060
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,070
decoration reasons this evidence potentials but because it's in the books

1061
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:42,440
potentials but because it's in the books let's talk about it so you need to say

1062
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,140
let's talk about it so you need to say at least mathematically how we write

1063
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,580
at least mathematically how we write this summations when some of the nodes

1064
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,220
this summations when some of the nodes are logged out some particular values

1065
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:52,400
are logged out some particular values and we denote this as X bar so it's an

1066
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,660
and we denote this as X bar so it's an old I as a specific value we you know

1067
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:59,060
old I as a specific value we you know this as X bar I all right so that's

1068
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,490
this as X bar I all right so that's evidence we have so that now basically

1069
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:04,160
evidence we have so that now basically is can only take the value by the

1070
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:12,180
is can only take the value by the evidence and cannot change so

1071
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:12,190


1072
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:19,349
so so let's see how are we this evidence is going to come on the in various ways

1073
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:26,220
is going to come on the in various ways on these estimations so let's say with

1074
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,250
on these estimations so let's say with what does it say that we want to compute

1075
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:33,109
what does it say that we want to compute P of x1 given the evidence exists okay

1076
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:36,299
P of x1 given the evidence exists okay so you know we observe that ticks and we

1077
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:38,039
so you know we observe that ticks and we won't find what's the condition of x1

1078
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:41,430
won't find what's the condition of x1 given x2 so obviously to do this

1079
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:43,230
given x2 so obviously to do this calculation we have to find the joint of

1080
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:47,760
calculation we have to find the joint of X 1 and X 6 and I write this as a joint

1081
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,339
X 1 and X 6 and I write this as a joint event or X 6 you know this is prescribed

1082
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:54,390
event or X 6 you know this is prescribed okay so when I guess the same plate by

1083
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:56,339
okay so when I guess the same plate by pushing the summation of seen words in

1084
00:58:56,339 --> 00:59:01,230
pushing the summation of seen words in the in the variables 2 3 4 5 but notice

1085
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:04,140
the in the variables 2 3 4 5 but notice on this conditional of X 6 given X 2 and

1086
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:08,160
on this conditional of X 6 given X 2 and X 5 if you have this probability that

1087
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,740
X 5 if you have this probability that corresponds basically to accessorize or

1088
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:15,420
corresponds basically to accessorize or the third dimensional table the precept

1089
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:18,210
the third dimensional table the precept the X 16 take various values that say 0

1090
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:20,339
the X 16 take various values that say 0 and 1 clear right so if I give you the

1091
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:23,700
and 1 clear right so if I give you the next year next 6 the bar is 1 you're

1092
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,170
next year next 6 the bar is 1 you're going to take one of this slice of this

1093
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:27,930
going to take one of this slice of this table all right so this is what this

1094
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:32,359
table all right so this is what this will imply so when you say mean X 5

1095
00:59:32,359 --> 00:59:35,309
will imply so when you say mean X 5 you're going to define a potential 3 X 5

1096
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:37,470
you're going to define a potential 3 X 5 and the valley was left will be X 2 and

1097
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:40,890
and the valley was left will be X 2 and X 3 all right then you have to sum 1 X 4

1098
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:43,019
X 3 all right then you have to sum 1 X 4 so these are the only variables that

1099
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:45,510
so these are the only variables that involve X fourth I'm sorry queries

1100
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:48,390
involve X fourth I'm sorry queries theater now actually so this potential

1101
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:51,329
theater now actually so this potential is outside the summation right I left it

1102
00:59:51,329 --> 00:59:54,660
is outside the summation right I left it to the right because from the particular

1103
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:58,130
to the right because from the particular reason so I saw an X for this equal to 1

1104
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,559
reason so I saw an X for this equal to 1 then I have to summon extreme this

1105
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:06,809
then I have to summon extreme this potential depends on X 3 okay so I have

1106
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:08,490
potential depends on X 3 okay so I have the point of the worst two terms so it

1107
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:10,500
the point of the worst two terms so it will be a new potential 3 X 3 of X 1 and

1108
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:15,180
will be a new potential 3 X 3 of X 1 and X 2 and and then I have to sum 1 X 2 and

1109
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,950
X 2 and and then I have to sum 1 X 2 and I have the product of two potentials and

1110
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:19,319
I have the product of two potentials and this conditional and I get basically a

1111
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:21,839
this conditional and I get basically a new potential which is V X 2 and the

1112
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:22,779
new potential which is V X 2 and the only variable left is

1113
01:00:22,779 --> 01:00:28,719
only variable left is Swan and if you so this is the joint

1114
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:32,049
Swan and if you so this is the joint alright and if you want the conditional

1115
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:35,259
alright and if you want the conditional given the evidence x6 bar is basically

1116
01:00:35,259 --> 01:00:37,829
given the evidence x6 bar is basically this is the final result

1117
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:46,299
this is the final result okay so so this is sort of a way one of

1118
01:00:46,299 --> 01:00:48,729
okay so so this is sort of a way one of the ways to calculate the evidence by

1119
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:54,009
the ways to calculate the evidence by taking slices of this table okay

1120
01:00:54,009 --> 01:00:57,699
taking slices of this table okay you don't need this the only way that

1121
01:00:57,699 --> 01:01:00,699
you don't need this the only way that you can account for evidence is using

1122
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:04,419
you can account for evidence is using circle Delta function okay so the adage

1123
01:01:04,419 --> 01:01:06,370
circle Delta function okay so the adage sort of power to reveal a good thing you

1124
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,620
sort of power to reveal a good thing you ever program it this way but let's say

1125
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:12,370
ever program it this way but let's say rather some node if you give it the

1126
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:14,679
rather some node if you give it the value so what you do is you are trying

1127
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:17,650
value so what you do is you are trying to that node a potential that you can

1128
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:20,019
to that node a potential that you can evidence potential and that potential is

1129
01:01:20,019 --> 01:01:35,499
evidence potential and that potential is a function do the observable of a

1130
01:01:35,499 --> 01:01:36,999
a function do the observable of a selection of the slice from that

1131
01:01:36,999 --> 01:01:39,009
selection of the slice from that conditional distribution without doing

1132
01:01:39,009 --> 01:01:43,079
conditional distribution without doing it sort of explicit to show for example

1133
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:46,029
it sort of explicit to show for example if you want to write the probability

1134
01:01:46,029 --> 01:01:51,269
if you want to write the probability let's say of let's say we have you know

1135
01:01:51,269 --> 01:01:55,449
let's say of let's say we have you know this probability of x given X 2 and X 5

1136
01:01:55,449 --> 01:02:00,459
this probability of x given X 2 and X 5 all right so using this evidence

1137
01:02:00,459 --> 01:02:03,549
all right so using this evidence potential for now the 6 because the node

1138
01:02:03,549 --> 01:02:06,669
potential for now the 6 because the node X 6 is clung to this value you use this

1139
01:02:06,669 --> 01:02:09,549
X 6 is clung to this value you use this potential and you say when someone at 6

1140
01:02:09,549 --> 01:02:12,309
potential and you say when someone at 6 and obviously this summation 4 X 6 will

1141
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:15,849
and obviously this summation 4 X 6 will give you an exit bar right because

1142
01:02:15,849 --> 01:02:18,449
give you an exit bar right because that's the only value of 6 can take

1143
01:02:18,449 --> 01:02:20,829
that's the only value of 6 can take usually programming like this but you

1144
01:02:20,829 --> 01:02:25,100
usually programming like this but you know sort of want to write it in in

1145
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:28,100
know sort of want to write it in in in in a generic way mathematical you can

1146
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,990
in in a generic way mathematical you can say the providers have given have

1147
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:32,510
say the providers have given have married assigning an evidence potential

1148
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:34,660
married assigning an evidence potential in addition to the condition of

1149
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,980
in addition to the condition of distributions so when you write the

1150
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:40,100
distributions so when you write the distribution the focus of the graph you

1151
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,780
distribution the focus of the graph you also multiplied with the saboteurs

1152
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:44,120
also multiplied with the saboteurs potentials from the rest basically in

1153
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,950
potentials from the rest basically in the elimination algorithm is exactly is

1154
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:52,880
the elimination algorithm is exactly is before and they're basically I

1155
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,190
before and they're basically I generalized this with disturb this

1156
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:56,060
generalized this with disturb this protection

1157
01:02:56,060 --> 01:03:00,080
protection all right so change the algorithm the

1158
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,880
all right so change the algorithm the elimination algorithm and directed

1159
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,600
elimination algorithm and directed graphs so you have a graph G with

1160
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:11,380
graphs so you have a graph G with evidence T actually exists let me see

1161
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:11,390


1162
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:17,290
so is the evidence yes the evidence nodes an effort of the planning node

1163
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:22,540
nodes an effort of the planning node okay so using Jordans notation here so

1164
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:25,060
okay so using Jordans notation here so so what you need to do is you need to

1165
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:30,470
so what you need to do is you need to initialize the graph okay basically yeah

1166
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:33,320
initialize the graph okay basically yeah the good is to understand the potentials

1167
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,510
the good is to understand the potentials that you have if you need to introduce

1168
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:37,550
that you have if you need to introduce the evidence what nodes have prescribed

1169
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:40,730
the evidence what nodes have prescribed values and sort of you know the

1170
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:47,480
values and sort of you know the functions that we discussed it then if

1171
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:50,870
functions that we discussed it then if you need to update the graph given the

1172
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:53,150
you need to update the graph given the evidence so basically I will assume that

1173
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:55,490
evidence so basically I will assume that see the next slide this is where this

1174
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:58,310
see the next slide this is where this elimination algorithm is going to to

1175
01:03:58,310 --> 01:04:00,140
elimination algorithm is going to to happen and then effectively you have to

1176
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:04,700
happen and then effectively you have to normalize to this location let's see the

1177
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,770
normalize to this location let's see the details of what they saw what it was do

1178
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:08,180
details of what they saw what it was do and then we'll come back to it nothing

1179
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:11,230
and then we'll come back to it nothing on the top so let's have initialization

1180
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:16,250
on the top so let's have initialization if you choose and I think this is very

1181
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:18,620
if you choose and I think this is very important in ordering charts for the

1182
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:23,099
important in ordering charts for the query nodes are appearing the last

1183
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:23,109


1184
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:29,609
okay so you an elimination ordering basically Department we were doing store

1185
01:04:29,609 --> 01:04:32,759
basically Department we were doing store let's say probability of X 1 given the

1186
01:04:32,759 --> 01:04:34,620
let's say probability of X 1 given the evidence right so you want the 20 notes

1187
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:38,910
evidence right so you want the 20 notes to appear the last basically in the in

1188
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:41,699
to appear the last basically in the in the elimination order and in the

1189
01:04:41,699 --> 01:04:43,609
the elimination order and in the initialization for its note

1190
01:04:43,609 --> 01:04:47,670
initialization for its note Yuma please place the conditional

1191
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:50,940
Yuma please place the conditional probability in the activation potentials

1192
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:54,779
probability in the activation potentials so you're gonna keep significant list of

1193
01:04:54,779 --> 01:04:57,690
so you're gonna keep significant list of the kind all the positions in the

1194
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:59,910
the kind all the positions in the problem and best potentials to start

1195
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:05,160
problem and best potentials to start would be this elimination so this is

1196
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,949
would be this elimination so this is what you start with and obviously you

1197
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:09,449
what you start with and obviously you need to have an active list because

1198
01:05:09,449 --> 01:05:11,549
need to have an active list because later on in the active list you are

1199
01:05:11,549 --> 01:05:12,809
later on in the active list you are going to help them to reduce these

1200
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:14,779
going to help them to reduce these potentials when we do elimination

1201
01:05:14,779 --> 01:05:18,150
potentials when we do elimination variables so this active list will keep

1202
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:20,459
variables so this active list will keep track of one of the potentials that

1203
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:22,289
track of one of the potentials that define the factorization of your joint

1204
01:05:22,289 --> 01:05:25,949
define the factorization of your joint in the ground okay so we initialize and

1205
01:05:25,949 --> 01:05:28,049
in the ground okay so we initialize and you plate this active list where you put

1206
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:31,049
you plate this active list where you put all this conditional distributions you

1207
01:05:31,049 --> 01:05:35,519
all this conditional distributions you have to put the elements effectively for

1208
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:37,620
have to put the elements effectively for every node in the evidence you have to

1209
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:41,390
every node in the evidence you have to place this evidence potential all right

1210
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:44,939
place this evidence potential all right okay and you notice it says purchase the

1211
01:05:44,939 --> 01:05:47,249
okay and you notice it says purchase the evidence potential on the active list so

1212
01:05:47,249 --> 01:05:48,479
evidence potential on the active list so you have got a great sort of these

1213
01:05:48,479 --> 01:05:50,519
you have got a great sort of these sample functions this type of the

1214
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:52,769
sample functions this type of the population because when you're in the

1215
01:05:52,769 --> 01:05:54,420
population because when you're in the factorization you're also going to

1216
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,819
factorization you're also going to multiply and say let's say well fact six

1217
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,910
multiply and say let's say well fact six for mac six bar because x6 cannot take

1218
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:02,670
for mac six bar because x6 cannot take any other value by the next six bar okay

1219
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:05,910
any other value by the next six bar okay so this will be part of the alright so

1220
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:08,339
so this will be part of the alright so this is what the evident passed this is

1221
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:11,249
this is what the evident passed this is what the initialization does setting is

1222
01:06:11,249 --> 01:06:12,829
what the initialization does setting is potentials from the active list and

1223
01:06:12,829 --> 01:06:17,579
potentials from the active list and let's say be a beta so you both need the

1224
01:06:17,579 --> 01:06:21,870
let's say be a beta so you both need the knowledge in the elimination order you

1225
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:24,359
knowledge in the elimination order you think the potentials in the active list

1226
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:27,019
think the potentials in the active list that contains the knowledge

1227
01:06:27,019 --> 01:06:29,390
that contains the knowledge and then go remove us from the after

1228
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:35,930
and then go remove us from the after this is going to be summation X I and

1229
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:37,759
this is going to be summation X I and you are going to come up with a new

1230
01:06:37,759 --> 01:06:40,970
you are going to come up with a new potential P of X I and then you have got

1231
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,650
potential P of X I and then you have got a place that we are assigned the octave

1232
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:45,019
a place that we are assigned the octave later everything else will disappear

1233
01:06:45,019 --> 01:06:51,110
later everything else will disappear from the actively

1234
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:51,120


1235
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:56,910
this is not good information is really didn't need them anymore alright so if

1236
01:06:56,910 --> 01:07:00,920
didn't need them anymore alright so if you are going to sum over this service

1237
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:05,190
you are going to sum over this service the potentials basically that involved

1238
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:10,380
the potentials basically that involved three they have no big sigh all right so

1239
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:13,920
three they have no big sigh all right so you summon X I and you get rid of those

1240
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,780
you summon X I and you get rid of those products and you stop see those

1241
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:20,130
products and you stop see those potentials with f3 oxide okay and so

1242
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:22,020
potentials with f3 oxide okay and so that's the update and then of course

1243
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:24,540
that's the update and then of course when you finish and you have reached

1244
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,790
when you finish and you have reached your query notes what you need to do is

1245
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:29,580
your query notes what you need to do is you need these are the the potentials

1246
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:33,090
you need these are the the potentials that only refer to the query - except

1247
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:35,640
that only refer to the query - except obviously have to normalize those all

1248
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:39,660
obviously have to normalize those all right and then get one okay so you are

1249
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,790
right and then get one okay so you are going that way you have going to compute

1250
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:44,790
going that way you have going to compute the conditional distribution of x given

1251
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:58,580
the conditional distribution of x given X we have right but let me try to

1252
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:02,040
X we have right but let me try to rapidly see if we can introduce here

1253
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:05,160
rapidly see if we can introduce here what's going on with graphically want to

1254
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,110
what's going on with graphically want to do this process so we're going again at

1255
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:15,000
do this process so we're going again at this estimation all right so to come up

1256
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,860
this estimation all right so to come up with potential we have this product that

1257
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:28,230
with potential we have this product that contains X I all right and contained in

1258
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,450
contains X I all right and contained in this potentials would know that ty

1259
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:33,360
this potentials would know that ty all right and this knowledge the notes

1260
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,309
all right and this knowledge the notes that are actually related with what I

1261
01:08:35,309 --> 01:08:36,900
that are actually related with what I call the elimination clique in the graph

1262
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:41,820
call the elimination clique in the graph so identification of a set of nodes

1263
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:45,930
so identification of a set of nodes right to disconnect it alright so as the

1264
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:49,510
right to disconnect it alright so as the elimination process happens I have

1265
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:51,730
elimination process happens I have creative three notes I integrate over

1266
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:54,730
creative three notes I integrate over one node and then I'm elected with let's

1267
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:57,880
one node and then I'm elected with let's say two nodes all right but the trick

1268
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,130
say two nodes all right but the trick that I'm eliminating one node has three

1269
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:02,710
that I'm eliminating one node has three notes that's the elimination clique and

1270
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:05,019
notes that's the elimination clique and the maximum of this cliques is going to

1271
01:09:05,019 --> 01:09:09,150
the maximum of this cliques is going to define the complexity of the algorithm

1272
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:09,160


1273
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:15,120
so

1274
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:15,130


1275
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:22,110
so can you look at this you know different people for graphs and think

1276
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:24,000
different people for graphs and think elimination I would have been proceeding

1277
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,490
elimination I would have been proceeding with a method by the time and tell me

1278
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:28,730
with a method by the time and tell me which one do you think is going to be

1279
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:31,680
which one do you think is going to be more complicated computationally

1280
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,050
more complicated computationally speaking do you look at the definitions

1281
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:36,300
speaking do you look at the definitions but look at this if you're studying I

1282
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,050
but look at this if you're studying I mean anything

1283
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:39,510
mean anything one node at a time and then you have to

1284
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:42,720
one node at a time and then you have to do summation over the affiliated no to

1285
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,160
do summation over the affiliated no to that no chocolate shake

1286
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:47,340
that no chocolate shake it's really my neighbors know how many

1287
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:50,099
it's really my neighbors know how many nodes in the potentials are related to

1288
01:09:50,099 --> 01:09:59,149
nodes in the potentials are related to this node how many

1289
01:09:59,149 --> 01:09:59,159


1290
01:09:59,159 --> 01:10:06,290
so from here if you are there the you know they're the joint right the pop

1291
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:08,570
know they're the joint right the pop your eyes and you want to eliminate this

1292
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:12,649
your eyes and you want to eliminate this and you saw over that note how many in

1293
01:10:12,649 --> 01:10:14,360
and you saw over that note how many in the potential that is that you're going

1294
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,939
the potential that is that you're going to be doing the some how many or the

1295
01:10:16,939 --> 01:10:28,140
to be doing the some how many or the body will start involved

1296
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:28,150


1297
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:30,960
my name's pinky all right what are you gonna have you're gonna have the

1298
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,760
gonna have you're gonna have the probability of this given that and the

1299
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,680
probability of this given that and the probability of that given that so many

1300
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:41,250
probability of that given that so many coming in knowledge involve this how

1301
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:49,640
coming in knowledge involve this how many times we have how many how many

1302
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:49,650


1303
01:10:49,650 --> 01:11:06,050
how many times this actually 25 let's say comes problem so so if you calculate

1304
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:09,230
say comes problem so so if you calculate right here we define the period as the

1305
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:11,270
right here we define the period as the minimum size of a hospital immolations

1306
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:13,670
minimum size of a hospital immolations of the rats monthly created during golf

1307
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:22,550
of the rats monthly created during golf elimination - 1 so the click here is all

1308
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:25,670
elimination - 1 so the click here is all right because I reversed in Iran and we

1309
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:27,290
right because I reversed in Iran and we put the minus 1 because this is a

1310
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:29,330
put the minus 1 because this is a twisting action we want to have this

1311
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:32,420
twisting action we want to have this variable that forest is equal to 1 all

1312
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:34,100
variable that forest is equal to 1 all right

1313
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,800
right in this case basically this is the only

1314
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,620
in this case basically this is the only potential you know that you will work

1315
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:42,080
potential you know that you will work with so this is the click the clickers

1316
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,500
with so this is the click the clickers is of size Q minus 1 the thing which we

1317
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:49,240
is of size Q minus 1 the thing which we defined to be equal to 1

1318
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:49,250


1319
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:53,150
so how do you want to eliminate this all right

1320
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:55,910
right what is going on well actually let's

1321
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:57,590
what is going on well actually let's take something more accomplished you

1322
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:58,640
take something more accomplished you know take something more complicated

1323
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:04,100
know take something more complicated take something here you know you know

1324
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:07,430
take something here you know you know how many you know how many things we

1325
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:12,200
how many you know how many things we need to eliminate so if you try to

1326
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,300
need to eliminate so if you try to eliminate this while we have to do

1327
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:17,360
eliminate this while we have to do something in sequence so let's see which

1328
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:22,750
something in sequence so let's see which will eliminate

1329
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:22,760


1330
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,800
I mean consider that this thing goes up and downs right so it is a

1331
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,260
and downs right so it is a two-dimensional graph looking like that

1332
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,600
two-dimensional graph looking like that so it doesn't matter let's concentrate

1333
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,790
so it doesn't matter let's concentrate on this on this node and let's say we

1334
01:12:33,790 --> 01:12:37,660
on this on this node and let's say we have eliminated this so how many how

1335
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,990
have eliminated this so how many how many potentials how many vegetables

1336
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:42,310
many potentials how many vegetables where eliminate what is the elimination

1337
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:44,860
where eliminate what is the elimination click where the summation is going to

1338
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:48,970
click where the summation is going to operate how many nodes will involve

1339
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:51,640
operate how many nodes will involve let's say this now we assume this

1340
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:55,180
let's say this now we assume this already we eliminate it to the right how

1341
01:12:55,180 --> 01:13:04,690
already we eliminate it to the right how many how many 3 so 3 minus 1 so the 3

1342
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:08,410
many how many 3 so 3 minus 1 so the 3 width is 2 and the chatter a more

1343
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:10,170
width is 2 and the chatter a more complicated case

1344
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:18,160
complicated case so obviously the nation's if everybody

1345
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,700
so obviously the nation's if everybody both can take K values the cost of every

1346
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:24,610
both can take K values the cost of every notice k2 w plus 1 could not use the 3

1347
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:27,670
notice k2 w plus 1 could not use the 3 wait and then times V this gives you the

1348
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:32,440
wait and then times V this gives you the order of the calculation if you didn't

1349
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,060
order of the calculation if you didn't give elimination I would basically the

1350
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:36,490
give elimination I would basically the cost would be K to the power D all right

1351
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:38,590
cost would be K to the power D all right D is the total number of nodes so

1352
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:41,140
D is the total number of nodes so obviously this is linear in V so it's V

1353
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:43,030
obviously this is linear in V so it's V times K 2w plus 1

1354
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:44,770
times K 2w plus 1 and lots of kinds of things so many

1355
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:46,360
and lots of kinds of things so many lectures we think with the plus 1

1356
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,480
lectures we think with the plus 1 because you know 12 years big the 1

1357
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:52,090
because you know 12 years big the 1 doesn't make much difference but this is

1358
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:57,700
doesn't make much difference but this is the sort of the correct route list okay

1359
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:57,710


1360
01:13:57,710 --> 01:14:07,120
so the best and in the context of undirected graphs okay I mentioned we

1361
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,680
undirected graphs okay I mentioned we are gonna be here in the Big Show you

1362
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,960
are gonna be here in the Big Show you can unify the directed and undirected

1363
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,360
can unify the directed and undirected graphs with the addition of a little bit

1364
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,510
graphs with the addition of a little bit ahead of ourselves because I haven't

1365
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:18,940
ahead of ourselves because I haven't discussed the factorization of the Joint

1366
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:22,630
discussed the factorization of the Joint Distribution over undirected graphs but

1367
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:27,760
Distribution over undirected graphs but let me just state it alright so then

1368
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,790
let me just state it alright so then we're gonna be difficult here and we

1369
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:32,890
we're gonna be difficult here and we will come back to this in details in the

1370
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:35,320
will come back to this in details in the graphs you know the remember we have the

1371
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,840
graphs you know the remember we have the probability of fabric now attacks

1372
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:50,530
probability of fabric now attacks developments in analyzed in terms of you

1373
01:14:50,530 --> 01:15:08,620
developments in analyzed in terms of you know is X 1 X 2 X 5 X 3 it lik know why

1374
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:11,560
know is X 1 X 2 X 5 X 3 it lik know why because X 1 and X 5 are not connected

1375
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,350
because X 1 and X 5 are not connected because X 2 X they are not connected so

1376
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:16,330
because X 2 X they are not connected so easily here that you have a sufficient

1377
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:19,390
easily here that you have a sufficient undirected graph you have this clique we

1378
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,250
undirected graph you have this clique we have this clique you have this clique

1379
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,340
have this clique you have this clique and then you have it later of 3 and then

1380
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:26,500
and then you have it later of 3 and then you have a clique of 2 so each of these

1381
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,200
you have a clique of 2 so each of these cliques comes with the potential note

1382
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,420
cliques comes with the potential note the distribution just the potential of

1383
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:33,660
the distribution just the potential of those functions that sort of explains

1384
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:36,490
those functions that sort of explains well standing variables are correlated

1385
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,830
well standing variables are correlated involved late right but they're you know

1386
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:45,490
involved late right but they're you know distributions their potentials you know

1387
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:48,910
distributions their potentials you know if you elimination on undirected graphs

1388
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:52,150
if you elimination on undirected graphs they will be actually literally is a

1389
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:54,610
they will be actually literally is a typical form of the algorithm for

1390
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:57,060
typical form of the algorithm for directed graphs but it's ridiculous

1391
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:59,529
directed graphs but it's ridiculous complicated because there is no errors

1392
01:15:59,529 --> 01:16:01,600
complicated because there is no errors or anything like that so when I have

1393
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,700
or anything like that so when I have been in this Bluff I took the joint

1394
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:06,040
been in this Bluff I took the joint distribution I loved it in terms of

1395
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,810
distribution I loved it in terms of potential over rocks more clicks as I

1396
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:11,049
potential over rocks more clicks as I just called here alright I panting the

1397
01:16:11,049 --> 01:16:14,100
just called here alright I panting the evidence as you see in here okay and

1398
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:21,089
evidence as you see in here okay and then to find this joint I the summations

1399
01:16:21,089 --> 01:16:21,099


1400
01:16:21,099 --> 01:16:27,069
and exactly as we did with very few graphs the rotation is practically

1401
01:16:27,069 --> 01:16:28,540
graphs the rotation is practically identical

1402
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,459
identical this is thing that you see that is

1403
01:16:30,459 --> 01:16:32,770
this is thing that you see that is different here from what we did with

1404
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:35,680
different here from what we did with directed graphs when you write this

1405
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,479
directed graphs when you write this joint probabilities in terms of these

1406
01:16:37,479 --> 01:16:40,060
joint probabilities in terms of these potentials this optimization does not

1407
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,609
potentials this optimization does not give you normalize distribution so the

1408
01:16:42,609 --> 01:16:44,709
give you normalize distribution so the normalization factor basically there is

1409
01:16:44,709 --> 01:16:47,979
normalization factor basically there is not no but eventually when you give me

1410
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:49,689
not no but eventually when you give me lots of blood alright then you can fill

1411
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:52,000
lots of blood alright then you can fill this joint and you want this conditional

1412
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,819
this joint and you want this conditional you don't really need Z because once you

1413
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:57,100
you don't really need Z because once you get this potential this is what you

1414
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:59,049
get this potential this is what you believe this

1415
01:16:59,049 --> 01:17:02,379
believe this this conditional distribution and it is

1416
01:17:02,379 --> 01:17:04,930
this conditional distribution and it is what we're gonna do is so the skids can

1417
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:08,589
what we're gonna do is so the skids can invade the room where the stress in

1418
01:17:08,589 --> 01:17:10,750
invade the room where the stress in action and then we are going to merge

1419
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:12,850
action and then we are going to merge the two algorithms and give you sort of

1420
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:15,069
the two algorithms and give you sort of a graph theoretic approach with

1421
01:17:15,069 --> 01:17:17,830
a graph theoretic approach with elimination of cliques but we'll do the

1422
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:19,299
elimination of cliques but we'll do the elimination of it so you don't really

1423
01:17:19,299 --> 01:17:22,180
elimination of it so you don't really have to say division of variables but

1424
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:24,520
have to say division of variables but basically you've been at eliminating

1425
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,640
basically you've been at eliminating nodes one at the same time deprived of

1426
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,529
nodes one at the same time deprived of the clicks for this and also eliminated

1427
01:17:29,529 --> 01:17:33,100
the clicks for this and also eliminated there will be some marriage with some

1428
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,720
there will be some marriage with some organization process happening in the

1429
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,339
organization process happening in the process and some other weird things but

1430
01:17:36,339 --> 01:17:38,529
process and some other weird things but they will all be theoretical approaches

1431
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:40,810
they will all be theoretical approaches so will be operations on the graph not

1432
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:42,669
so will be operations on the graph not in the distribution anymore okay

1433
01:17:42,669 --> 01:17:45,549
in the distribution anymore okay so actually so you can do it you can be

1434
01:17:45,549 --> 01:17:51,750
so actually so you can do it you can be ahead of me and I will say remember you

1435
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,919
ahead of me and I will say remember you sometime in the very near future

1436
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:56,339
sometime in the very near future okay so for any conditions in the former

1437
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:59,349
okay so for any conditions in the former Rubick
