00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:45,520
当我从这个开始时，事情就变成了现在的想法
doing marginalization and all of these things the lefty way the idea now is

75
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,590
当我从这个开始时，事情就变成了现在的想法

76
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
当我从这个开始时，事情就变成了现在的想法
when I'm going to start with this and try to prove this you know if this not

follows and this is what we need okay all right

82
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:57,430
跟着，这就是我们需要的好吧
all right so just if you think that sort of you

83
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,370
因此，即使您认为您必须要选择分配类型或家庭类型
all right so just if you think that sort of you

84
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,969
因此，即使您认为您必须要选择分配类型或家庭类型
so just if you think that sort of you have to type of distribution or family

该图还可以，因此如果您的分布没有
distribution without doesn't describe independence relations

212
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,160

213
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,530
没有描述图的独立关系，所以如果不满足

226
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:38,930
影响的联合概率的值，以及为什么我不做
effects and why I am NOT going to do the algebra you can it's right here assuming

227
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,800
代数你可以在这里，假设计算正确无误，但是
effects and why I am NOT going to do the algebra you can it's right here assuming

228
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,610
代数你可以在这里，假设计算正确无误，但是
algebra you can it's right here assuming the calculations are correct right but

229
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:44,620
代数你可以在这里，假设计算正确无误，但是
the calculations are correct right but it comes up that you can show that V of

230
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,460
结果是，您可以证明X到Y的V等于Y的XP的P，所以
the calculations are correct right but it comes up that you can show that V of

231
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,760
结果是，您可以证明X到Y的V等于Y的XP的P，所以
it comes up that you can show that V of X to the Y is equal to P of X P of Y so

232
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:51,770
结果是，您可以证明X到Y的V等于Y的XP的P，所以
X to the Y is equal to P of X P of Y so the x and y are marginally independent

233
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,150
x和y几乎是独立的，所以这只小鸡
X to the Y is equal to P of X P of Y so the x and y are marginally independent

234
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:59,350
x和y几乎是独立的，所以这只小鸡
the x and y are marginally independent all right so the chickens for this

235
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
x和y几乎是独立的，所以这只小鸡
all right so the chickens for this problem is the center don't involve sex

236
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,829
问题是中心不涉及独立于Y的性别好吧这里没有图

237
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:06,220
问题是中心不涉及独立于Y的性别好吧这里没有图

238
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,230
问题是中心不涉及独立于Y的性别好吧这里没有图
independent of Y all right no graph here or anything like that right so we have

239
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,350
或类似的权利，所以我们拥有此分布，并且只有
independent of Y all right no graph here or anything like that right so we have

240
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,630
或类似的权利，所以我们拥有此分布，并且只有
or anything like that right so we have this distribution and the only

241
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
或类似的权利，所以我们拥有此分布，并且只有
this distribution and the only independence relation you can solve is

242
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,420
您可以解决的独立性关系就是您在这里看到的那么高FP

244
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:17,029
您可以解决的独立性关系就是您在这里看到的那么高FP
is what you see here so high F P is the set that only includes X independent of

245
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:19,510
现在只包含独立于Y的X的集合现在让我们考虑不同的图
is what you see here so high F P is the set that only includes X independent of

246
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:24,360
现在只包含独立于Y的X的集合现在让我们考虑不同的图

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,370
现在只包含独立于Y的X的集合现在让我们考虑不同的图
Y now let's consider different graphs and let's see what is I of G for each of

248
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:29,050
让我们看看这些图的G的I是多少
Y now let's consider different graphs and let's see what is I of G for each of

249
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,670
让我们看看这些图的G的I是多少
and let's see what is I of G for each of these graphs how many independent

250
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:30,680
让我们看看这些图的G的I是多少
these graphs how many independent relations we have here on the left

251
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,110
我们在左边的关系
these graphs how many independent relations we have here on the left

252
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,000
这个噪声在x和y之间不存在，所以关系是什么
these graphs how many independent relations we have here on the left

253
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,010
这个噪声在x和y之间不存在，所以关系是什么


254
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,250
这个噪声在x和y之间不存在，所以关系是什么
this noise exists between x and y nothing so so what is the relation

255
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:43,260
这个噪声在x和y之间不存在，所以关系是什么
nothing so so what is the relation between x and y independent y FG is

256
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,650
在x和y之间独立y FG包括此类型的包含20x
nothing so so what is the relation between x and y independent y FG is

257
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,090
在x和y之间独立y FG包括此类型的包含20x
between x and y independent y FG is include this this type of include 20x

258
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:50,100
在x和y之间独立y FG包括此类型的包含20x
include this this type of include 20x independent Y in this case there is no

259
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,480
在这种情况下，独立Y不存在独立关系0，并且此列表不存在
include this this type of include 20x independent Y in this case there is no

260
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,120
在这种情况下，独立Y不存在独立关系0，并且此列表不存在
independent Y in this case there is no independence relation 0 and this list no

261
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,130
在这种情况下，独立Y不存在独立关系0，并且此列表不存在
independence relation 0 and this list no offense relation is 0 so the agreement

262
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,880
进攻关系为0，因此协议规定所有段落基本上都是您
independence relation 0 and this list no offense relation is 0 so the agreement

263
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,290
进攻关系为0，因此协议规定所有段落基本上都是您
offense relation is 0 so the agreement made that all paragraphs basically you

264
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:03,300
进攻关系为0，因此协议规定所有段落基本上都是您
made that all paragraphs basically you know they are can be used the surrogates

265
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,620
知道只要有一页，就可以使用它们来代替分布P
made that all paragraphs basically you know they are can be used the surrogates

266
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,010
知道只要有一页，就可以使用它们来代替分布P
know they are can be used the surrogates for the distribution P whenever a page

267
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,020
知道只要有一页，就可以使用它们来代替分布P
for the distribution P whenever a page has this property

268
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,520
具有此属性
for the distribution P whenever a page has this property

269
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:13,900
现在我可以列出这三个图表中的一些来表示
for the distribution P whenever a page has this property

270
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:13,910
现在我可以列出这三个图表中的一些来表示


271
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,700
现在我可以列出这三个图表中的一些来表示
all right now can I list some of these three graphs to represent the

272
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:19,710
现在我可以列出这三个图表中的一些来表示
three graphs to represent the distribution P this of course because it

273
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:26,510
分布P这当然是因为它满足时间依赖关系
three graphs to represent the distribution P this of course because it

274
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,640
分布P这当然是因为它满足时间依赖关系
distribution P this of course because it satisfies the time dependence relation

275
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:28,650
分布P这当然是因为它满足时间依赖关系
satisfies the time dependence relation this doesn't require any independence

276
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,480
这不需要任何独立性关系，所以任何分布都可以
satisfies the time dependence relation this doesn't require any independence

277
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,400
这不需要任何独立性关系，所以任何分布都可以
this doesn't require any independence relation so any distribution will go

278
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:34,410
这不需要任何独立性关系，所以任何分布都可以
relation so any distribution will go through it the distribution people

279
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,190
通过它分配人，尤其是在额外的独立性方面
relation so any distribution will go through it the distribution people

280
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,410
通过它分配人，尤其是在额外的独立性方面
through it the distribution people especially in additional independence

281
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:39,420
通过它分配人，尤其是在额外的独立性方面
especially in additional independence relation but that's okay right

282
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,810
关系，但没关系，您不会在此违反任何规定
especially in additional independence relation but that's okay right

283
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,460
关系，但没关系，您不会在此违反任何规定
relation but that's okay right you will not violate anything in this

284
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:43,470
关系，但没关系，您不会在此违反任何规定
you will not violate anything in this graph because this graph gives zero

285
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,530
图，因为该图给出了嵌入的零独立关系，可以
you will not violate anything in this graph because this graph gives zero

286
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,400
图，因为该图给出了嵌入的零独立关系，可以
graph because this graph gives zero independence relations embedded okay the

287
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,410
图，因为该图给出了嵌入的零独立关系，可以
independence relations embedded okay the same in this case so how can we open

288
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,340
在这种情况下也是一样，所以我们如何打开三个图I 1 I 2 I 3等等G的I
independence relations embedded okay the same in this case so how can we open

289
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,350
在这种情况下也是一样，所以我们如何打开三个图I 1 I 2 I 3等等G的I
same in this case so how can we open three graphs I 1 I 2 I 3 etc the I of G

290
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
在这种情况下也是一样，所以我们如何打开三个图I 1 I 2 I 3等等G的I
three graphs I 1 I 2 I 3 etc the I of G is subset the Phi of P so there are I

291
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,260
是P的Phi的子集，所以基本上有P分布的I Maps
three graphs I 1 I 2 I 3 etc the I of G is subset the Phi of P so there are I

292
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,360
是P的Phi的子集，所以基本上有P分布的I Maps
is subset the Phi of P so there are I Maps basically of the distribution P

293
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:02,370
是P的Phi的子集，所以基本上有P分布的I Maps
Maps basically of the distribution P alright and if you like a little

294
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:08,330
好吧，如果您喜欢我所说的话，
Maps basically of the distribution P alright and if you like a little

295
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,120
好吧，如果您喜欢我所说的话，
alright and if you like a little graphical justification of what I said

296
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,130
好吧，如果您喜欢我所说的话，
graphical justification of what I said before something that we put in red just

297
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,990
之前我们在这里用红色标注的内容，但是由于您只能确定
graphical justification of what I said before something that we put in red just

298
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,640
之前我们在这里用红色标注的内容，但是由于您只能确定
before something that we put in red just here but since you can only identify

299
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:16,650
之前我们在这里用红色标注的内容，但是由于您只能确定
here but since you can only identify graph tracks or apply equivalent alright

300
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,000
图形轨迹或应用等效的方法，所以这是我们的三个入门指南
here but since you can only identify graph tracks or apply equivalent alright

301
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,400
图形轨迹或应用等效的方法，所以这是我们的三个入门指南
graph tracks or apply equivalent alright so here are our three starter gets

302
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:22,410
图形轨迹或应用等效的方法，所以这是我们的三个入门指南
so here are our three starter gets basically three graphs all right

303
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,960
基本上三张图都可以，你知道我不是
so here are our three starter gets basically three graphs all right

304
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,990
基本上三张图都可以，你知道我不是
basically three graphs all right and there are you know I not of the

305
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,000
基本上三张图都可以，你知道我不是
and there are you know I not of the distribution P ok because to blast them

306
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,400
分布P ok是因为炸开它们基本上满足了基础
and there are you know I not of the distribution P ok because to blast them

307
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,390
分布P ok是因为炸开它们基本上满足了基础
distribution P ok because to blast them satisfy basically the underlying

308
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:40,400
分布P ok是因为炸开它们基本上满足了基础
satisfy basically the underlying independent relations with pikas

309
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,740
与皮卡斯的独立关系好这是一个
satisfy basically the underlying independent relations with pikas

310
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,920
与皮卡斯的独立关系好这是一个
independent relations with pikas ok which is this one

311
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,100
这没什么好说的，所以父母基本上会说这是否真的很正式
independent relations with pikas ok which is this one

312
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,110
这没什么好说的，所以父母基本上会说这是否真的很正式


313
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:57,220
这没什么好说的，所以父母基本上会说这是否真的很正式
this doesn't say anything so a parent basically says if this is really formal

314
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,230
这没什么好说的，所以父母基本上会说这是否真的很正式
basically says if this is really formal language because already we have paid

315
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,990
语言，因为如果G是，而我是a，那么我们已经带薪休假是十倍
basically says if this is really formal language because already we have paid

316
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,510
语言，因为如果G是，而我是a，那么我们已经带薪休假是十倍
language because already we have paid leave is ten times if G is and I'm a

317
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:01,520
语言，因为如果G是，而我是a，那么我们已经带薪休假是十倍
leave is ten times if G is and I'm a puppy then people priced according to G

318
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,360
幼犬，然后人们按照G定价，然后按照G受精
leave is ten times if G is and I'm a puppy then people priced according to G

319
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,590
幼犬，然后人们按照G定价，然后按照G受精
puppy then people priced according to G okay and fertilized according to G

320
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:08,600
幼犬，然后人们按照G定价，然后按照G受精
okay and fertilized according to G basically implies this authorization

321
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,480
基本上意味着我们迄今为止所看到的这种授权，并且
okay and fertilized according to G basically implies this authorization

322
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,760
基本上意味着我们迄今为止所看到的这种授权，并且
basically implies this authorization that we have seen up to now and the

323
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:12,770
基本上意味着我们迄今为止所看到的这种授权，并且
that we have seen up to now and the proof is sort of trivial because if you

324
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,450
证明是微不足道的，因为如果采用分布P并安排
that we have seen up to now and the proof is sort of trivial because if you

325
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,540
证明是微不足道的，因为如果采用分布P并安排
proof is sort of trivial because if you take the distribution P and you arrange

326
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:19,550
证明是微不足道的，因为如果采用分布P并安排
take the distribution P and you arrange the nodes in topological order using

327
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,270
使用某种概率的乘积规则按拓扑顺序排列节点
take the distribution P and you arrange the nodes in topological order using

328
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,020

329
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,030
使用某种概率的乘积规则按拓扑顺序排列节点
sort of the product rules of probability you can write it as you see on the first

330
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,460
您可以像在第一行中看到的那样编写它，或者总是在这里生病然后
sort of the product rules of probability you can write it as you see on the first

331
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,550
您可以像在第一行中看到的那样编写它，或者总是在这里生病然后
you can write it as you see on the first line or always be sick here and then

332
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
您可以像在第一行中看到的那样编写它，或者总是在这里生病然后
line or always be sick here and then these previous notes will be basically

333
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,740
这些以前的音符基本上将是
line or always be sick here and then these previous notes will be basically

334
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,500
这些以前的音符基本上将是
these previous notes will be basically the parent and the known descendants to

335
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:38,510
这些以前的音符基本上将是
the parent and the known descendants to accept the pilot so Z is the non

336
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,780
接受飞行员，所以Z是非后代-父母和我可以写
the parent and the known descendants to accept the pilot so Z is the non

337
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,930
接受飞行员，所以Z是非后代-父母和我可以写
accept the pilot so Z is the non descendants - the parent and I can write

338
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:43,940
接受飞行员，所以Z是非后代-父母和我可以写
descendants - the parent and I can write this probability equal to that Y because

339
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,290
这个概率等于Y，因为G是P的I，并且有
descendants - the parent and I can write this probability equal to that Y because

340
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,380
这个概率等于Y，因为G是P的I，并且有
this probability equal to that Y because G is an I'm up of P and there is the

341
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:50,390
这个概率等于Y，因为G是P的I，并且有
G is an I'm up of P and there is the proof of the fear all right Z is an IMAP

342
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:58,360
恐惧的证明，好吧Z是T ok的IMAP
G is an I'm up of P and there is the proof of the fear all right Z is an IMAP

343
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,830

proof of the fear all right Z is an IMAP of T ok

344
00:13:59,830 --> 00:13:59,840
恐惧的证明，好吧Z是T ok的IMAP
of T ok then P Papa Hodges according to C so

345
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,010
然后P Papa Hodges根据C，所以基本上的想法是，如果这满足
of T ok then P Papa Hodges according to C so

346
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,110
然后P Papa Hodges根据C，所以基本上的想法是，如果这满足
then P Papa Hodges according to C so basically the idea is if this satisfies

347
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
然后P Papa Hodges根据C，所以基本上的想法是，如果这满足
basically the idea is if this satisfies the independence relations implied by

348
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
然后，上帝暗示的独立关系就达到顶峰，并受精于
basically the idea is if this satisfies the independence relations implied by

349
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,540
然后，上帝暗示的独立关系就达到顶峰，并受精于
the independence relations implied by the God then peak and fertilized on the

350
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:10,550
然后，上帝暗示的独立关系就达到顶峰，并受精于
the God then peak and fertilized on the graph the way we have seen it which is

351
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,250
以我们看到的方式绘制图表，这没关系，因此再也没有什么特别的
the God then peak and fertilized on the graph the way we have seen it which is

352
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,900
以我们看到的方式绘制图表，这没关系，因此再也没有什么特别的
graph the way we have seen it which is this ok so again nothing extraordinary

353
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:16,910
以我们看到的方式绘制图表，这没关系，因此再也没有什么特别的
this ok so again nothing extraordinary we have seen this ten times but the

354
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,360
我们已经看过十次了，但是第一次是总共四次，只需要
this ok so again nothing extraordinary we have seen this ten times but the

355
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,780
我们已经看过十次了，但是第一次是总共四次，只需要
we have seen this ten times but the first is total four it only requires

356
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:22,790
我们已经看过十次了，但是第一次是总共四次，只需要
first is total four it only requires this property of conditional

357
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,170
图Z和B隐含的条件独立性的这一特性
first is total four it only requires this property of conditional

358
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,590
图Z和B隐含的条件独立性的这一特性
this property of conditional independence implied by the graph Z and

359
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
图Z和B隐含的条件独立性的这一特性
independence implied by the graph Z and this is what I have used okay now if you

360
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,820
这是我现在使用的，如果您权衡一下，我认为可能是
independence implied by the graph Z and this is what I have used okay now if you

361
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,250
这是我现在使用的，如果您权衡一下，我认为可能是
this is what I have used okay now if you weigh around and I think it may be

362
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:36,260
这是我现在使用的，如果您权衡一下，我认为可能是
weigh around and I think it may be coming in a few slides I won't cover

363
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,260
来几张幻灯片，我不会介绍，但是如果您想开始
weigh around and I think it may be coming in a few slides I won't cover

364
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,519
来几张幻灯片，我不会介绍，但是如果您想开始

00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:40,529
来几张幻灯片，我不会介绍，但是如果您想开始
that but if you want to start with ition that but for a sizzler gratin you

366
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:42,949
的意思是，但对于一个嘶哑的烤焦干酪，您想证明独立关系，例如
that but if you want to start with ition that but for a sizzler gratin you

367
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,470
的意思是，但对于一个嘶哑的烤焦干酪，您想证明独立关系，例如

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:03,390
给定D和B的方式好吧，所以分离实际上就是我们这样的分离
is really this separation the way we have said in directed graphs but this

492
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,779
已经在有向图中说过，但是这个无向图满足这种关系
is really this separation the way we have said in directed graphs but this

493
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:08,500
已经在有向图中说过，但是这个无向图满足这种关系
have said in directed graphs but this undirected graph satisfies this relation

494
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:08,510
已经在有向图中说过，但是这个无向图满足这种关系
undirected graph satisfies this relation okay this can you pass me that the

495
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,899
好吧，这可以告诉我最大的一个吗
undirected graph satisfies this relation okay this can you pass me that the

496
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:13,580
好吧，这可以告诉我最大的一个吗
okay this can you pass me that the biggest one out which basically it

497
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:13,590
好吧，这可以告诉我最大的一个吗
biggest one out which basically it doesn't care care about arrows or

498
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,019
不在乎箭头或其他任何东西，如果您知道您给了他们B
biggest one out which basically it doesn't care care about arrows or

499
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:18,440
不在乎箭头或其他任何东西，如果您知道您给了他们B
doesn't care care about arrows or anything if the you know you give them B

500
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:18,450
不在乎箭头或其他任何东西，如果您知道您给了他们B
anything if the you know you give them B then this path is blocked then this path

501
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,600
然后这条路被封锁然后这条路被封锁
anything if the you know you give them B then this path is blocked then this path

502
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,260
然后这条路被封锁然后这条路被封锁
then this path is blocked then this path is blocked

503
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:21,270
然后这条路被封锁然后这条路被封锁
is blocked okay if you're given a and T and you

504
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,250
好吧，如果给定a和T，并且您想转到这两个路径，
is blocked okay if you're given a and T and you

505
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,899
好吧，如果给定a和T，并且您想转到这两个路径，
okay if you're given a and T and you want to go to these the two paths are

506
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:26,909
好吧，如果给定a和T，并且您想转到这两个路径，
want to go to these the two paths are also blocked so this have the relations

507
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:29,240
也被阻止，所以这有关系，所以您要问的是我能找到
want to go to these the two paths are also blocked so this have the relations

508
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,539
也被阻止，所以这有关系，所以您要问的是我能找到
also blocked so this have the relations and so you're asking is can I find the

509
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:32,549
也被阻止，所以这有关系，所以您要问的是我能找到
and so you're asking is can I find the directed graph that actually satisfies

510
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:34,610
实际满足这两个关系的有向图
and so you're asking is can I find the directed graph that actually satisfies

511
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,710
实际满足这两个关系的有向图
directed graph that actually satisfies these two relations

512
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:36,720
实际满足这两个关系的有向图
these two relations and this and so here are two examples

513
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,259
这就是这两个例子尽管有两个
these two relations and this and so here are two examples

514
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:43,729
这就是这两个例子尽管有两个
and this and so here are two examples this examples have despite its two

515
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:43,739
这就是这两个例子尽管有两个
this examples have despite its two relation what do you think

516
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:47,059
关系你怎么看
this examples have despite its two relation what do you think

517
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:51,650
我的意思是你可以知道，我会说这实际上是你花了10分钟
this examples have despite its two relation what do you think

518
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:51,660
我的意思是你可以知道，我会说这实际上是你花了10分钟


519
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,850
我的意思是你可以知道，我会说这实际上是你花了10分钟
I mean you can you know and I would say this actually you spend maybe 10 minutes

520
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:55,860
我的意思是你可以知道，我会说这实际上是你花了10分钟
this actually you spend maybe 10 minutes to prove if this to the lessons are

521
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,280
证明这些图表是否满足本课程的要求，但请看一下
this actually you spend maybe 10 minutes to prove if this to the lessons are

522
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,590
证明这些图表是否满足本课程的要求，但请看一下
to prove if this to the lessons are satisfied by these graphs but just look

523
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:00,600
证明这些图表是否满足本课程的要求，但请看一下
satisfied by these graphs but just look at it visually are this two graphs

524
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,050
从视觉上看，这两个图基本上具有相同的独立
satisfied by these graphs but just look at it visually are this two graphs

525
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,490
从视觉上看，这两个图基本上具有相同的独立
at it visually are this two graphs basically having the same independent

526
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:04,500
从视觉上看，这两个图基本上具有相同的独立
basically having the same independent relation says this undirected graph so

527
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,110
关系说这个无向图，所以它在这里说，所以我们说这个图
basically having the same independent relation says this undirected graph so

528
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,640
关系说这个无向图，所以它在这里说，所以我们说这个图
relation says this undirected graph so it says here so let's say this graph

529
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:13,650
关系说这个无向图，所以它在这里说，所以我们说这个图
it says here so let's say this graph right which is being dependent on this

530
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,090
对，这取决于此图最大的部分是什么
it says here so let's say this graph right which is being dependent on this

531
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,200
对，这取决于此图最大的部分是什么
right which is being dependent on this graph what is the part of the biggest

532
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,210
对，这取决于此图最大的部分是什么
graph what is the part of the biggest algorithm of Facebook based independent

533
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,090
基于Facebook的D独立算法，无条件，无条件，是

534
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,390
基于Facebook的D独立算法，无条件，无条件，是
algorithm of Facebook based independent of D with no conditioning nothing is

535
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
基于Facebook的D独立算法，无条件，无条件，是
of D with no conditioning nothing is given right here right there's no

536
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,030
在这里给出的权利没有证据，所以这是没有条件的，
of D with no conditioning nothing is given right here right there's no

537
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:33,020
在这里给出的权利没有证据，所以这是没有条件的，
given right here right there's no evidence so that is no condition and the

538
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,030
在这里给出的权利没有证据，所以这是没有条件的，
evidence so that is no condition and the goal from B to D the only ways to go

539
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,730
目标从B到D的唯一途径是什么
evidence so that is no condition and the goal from B to D the only ways to go

540
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:41,780
目标从B到D的唯一途径是什么
goal from B to D the only ways to go through there and what is this is the

541
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:41,790
目标从B到D的唯一途径是什么
through there and what is this is the best marks right this is the explaining

542
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,810
最好的评分对，这是父母这次基本上造成的解释
through there and what is this is the best marks right this is the explaining

543
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,480
最好的评分对，这是父母这次基本上造成的解释
best marks right this is the explaining away this time parents basically causes

544
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:47,490
最好的评分对，这是父母这次基本上造成的解释
away this time parents basically causes of the same the factory so basically

545
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,900
同一家工厂，所以基本上，因为这甚至不是他们的博客
away this time parents basically causes of the same the factory so basically

546
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,000
同一家工厂，所以基本上，因为这甚至不是他们的博客
of the same the factory so basically since this is not even being their blog

547
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,010
同一家工厂，所以基本上，因为这甚至不是他们的博客
since this is not even being their blog though they are independent okay

548
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,710
尽管他们是独立的，所以这种关系与
since this is not even being their blog though they are independent okay

549
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,440
尽管他们是独立的，所以这种关系与
though they are independent okay so this relation has nothing to do with

550
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:00,450
尽管他们是独立的，所以这种关系与
so this relation has nothing to do with any of Austria's similarly BN one does

551
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,070
奥地利的任何一个类似国阵的人基本上都不满足这两个条件
so this relation has nothing to do with any of Austria's similarly BN one does

552
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,360
奥地利的任何一个类似国阵的人基本上都不满足这两个条件
any of Austria's similarly BN one does not satisfy basically those two

553
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,370
奥地利的任何一个类似国阵的人基本上都不满足这两个条件
not satisfy basically those two relations so bottom line

554
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,510
关系，因此底线不是每个分布都有一个完美的
not satisfy basically those two relations so bottom line

555
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,360
关系，因此底线不是每个分布都有一个完美的
relations so bottom line not every distribution has a perfect

556
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,370
关系，因此底线不是每个分布都有一个完美的
not every distribution has a perfect mark okay so don't expect to basically

557
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:16,430
标记好吧，所以不要指望基本上有分布然后撒
not every distribution has a perfect mark okay so don't expect to basically

558
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,320
标记好吧，所以不要指望基本上有分布然后撒
mark okay so don't expect to basically have a distribution and then sprinkle

559
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:18,330
标记好吧，所以不要指望基本上有分布然后撒
have a distribution and then sprinkle the graph that represents it usually you

560
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,570
代表它的图通常从带有一些图的图开始
have a distribution and then sprinkle the graph that represents it usually you

561
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,900
代表它的图通常从带有一些图的图开始
the graph that represents it usually you start with a graph with some

562
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:23,910
代表它的图通常从带有一些图的图开始
start with a graph with some mathematical intuition and then you use

563
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,450
数学直觉，然后将图形用作图形的代理

565
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:28,260
数学直觉，然后将图形用作图形的代理
the graph as a proxy for the distributions you want to to work with

566
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,400
您想使用它的发行版，但是这样做的想法是
the graph as a proxy for the distributions you want to to work with

567
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,160
您想使用它的发行版，但是这样做的想法是
distributions you want to to work with it but the idea to do that is if you are

568
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,170
您想使用它的发行版，但是这样做的想法是
it but the idea to do that is if you are limiting yourself to the distributions

569
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,110
将自己限制在满足我们图的性质的分布上
it but the idea to do that is if you are limiting yourself to the distributions

570
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,300
将自己限制在满足我们图的性质的分布上
limiting yourself to the distributions of satisfies the properties of our graph

571
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,310
将自己限制在满足我们图的性质的分布上
of satisfies the properties of our graph anything else basically

572
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,690
其他基本上可以使用的东西看起来都不像
of satisfies the properties of our graph anything else basically

573
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,520
其他基本上可以使用的东西看起来都不像
anything else basically working with it's not look like a

574
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:42,530
其他基本上可以使用的东西看起来都不像
working with it's not look like a mathematical model and you are have to

575
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,210
数学模型，您必须遵守该模型的规则，如果
working with it's not look like a mathematical model and you are have to

576
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,430
数学模型，您必须遵守该模型的规则，如果
mathematical model and you are have to obey the rules of that model and if the

577
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:48,440
数学模型，您必须遵守该模型的规则，如果
obey the rules of that model and if the model is wrong you have problems all

578
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,750
模型是错误的，您有问题没关系的基本上是
obey the rules of that model and if the model is wrong you have problems all

579
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,710
模型是错误的，您有问题没关系的基本上是
model is wrong you have problems all right don't need was to basically

they have time to have lots of drink my coffee so this is priority number six

587
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,150
他们有时间喝很多我的咖啡，所以这是第六要务
they have time to have lots of drink my coffee so this is priority number six

588
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:23,160
他们有时间喝很多我的咖啡，所以这是第六要务
coffee so this is priority number six okay so you'll be there by later today

589
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,400
好吧，今天晚些时候你会在那里
coffee so this is priority number six okay so you'll be there by later today

590
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:28,630
因此，有效地推断办公室意味着正确，但我们提供了一些建议
coffee so this is priority number six okay so you'll be there by later today

591
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
因此，有效地推断办公室意味着正确，但我们提供了一些建议


592
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,500
因此，有效地推断办公室意味着正确，但我们提供了一些建议
so inferencing the office effectively means right but we are giving some

593
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:33,510
因此，有效地推断办公室意味着正确，但我们提供了一些建议
means right but we are giving some evidence and we have to estimate some

594
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,039
证据，我们必须估计一些未知量，可以是
means right but we are giving some evidence and we have to estimate some

596
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360
证据，我们必须估计一些未知量，可以是
unknown quantities which can be either the student variables and and we do lots

597
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,430
学生变量，并且我们做了很多例子，基本上是隐藏变量
unknown quantities which can be either the student variables and and we do lots

学生变量，并且我们做了很多例子，基本上是隐藏变量
the student variables and and we do lots of examples basically hidden variables

599
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:45,990
学生变量，并且我们做了很多例子，基本上是隐藏变量
of examples basically hidden variables would be one for each data point but

600
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,120
每个数据点一个，但也有很多静态参数
of examples basically hidden variables would be one for each data point but

601
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,830

602
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
每个数据点一个，但也有很多静态参数
also will be lots of static parameters like the parameters in the conditional

603
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,390
就像我们需要做的条件分布中的参数一样
also will be lots of static parameters like the parameters in the conditional

604
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,029
就像我们需要做的条件分布中的参数一样
like the parameters in the conditional distributions that we need just made so

605
00:22:56,029 --> 00:22:56,039
就像我们需要做的条件分布中的参数一样
distributions that we need just made so that's an interest problem okay for

606
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:01,190
这是一个有趣的问题，例如在我们隐藏的马尔可夫模型中
distributions that we need just made so that's an interest problem okay for

607
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,289
这是一个有趣的问题，例如在我们隐藏的马尔可夫模型中
that's an interest problem okay for example in hidden Markov models that we

608
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:03,299
这是一个有趣的问题，例如在我们隐藏的马尔可夫模型中
example in hidden Markov models that we will spend maybe two lectures to to go

609
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,570
可能要花两堂课来讲解您刚刚制作的细节
example in hidden Markov models that we will spend maybe two lectures to to go

611
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:08,100
可能要花两堂课来讲解您刚刚制作的细节
through the details you just made the hidden states if you've given the

00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,560
隐藏状态，如果您已经对技术进行了观察
through the details you just made the hidden states if you've given the

613
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:17,060
隐藏状态，如果您已经对技术进行了观察
hidden states if you've given the technology observations okay in for

614
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,070
隐藏状态，如果您已经对技术进行了观察
technology observations okay in for example in disease-causing I'm sorry in

615
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,310
例如，在致病中，例如，在对称应用中，我很抱歉
technology observations okay in for example in disease-causing I'm sorry in

617
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:21,659
例如，在致病中，例如，在对称应用中，我很抱歉
in symmetrical applications for example did you know the some symptoms that the

618
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:25,220
您知道患者有哪些症状吗？您在问什么
in symmetrical applications for example did you know the some symptoms that the

619
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,830
您知道患者有哪些症状吗？您在问什么
did you know the some symptoms that the patient has and you are asking what is

620
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
您知道患者有哪些症状吗？您在问什么
patient has and you are asking what is the disease that causes those symptoms

621
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,570

patient has and you are asking what is the disease that causes those symptoms

622
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,779
导致这些症状的疾病还可以，所以基本上与
the disease that causes those symptoms okay so it's basically the same thing as

623
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:32,789
导致这些症状的疾病还可以，所以基本上与
okay so it's basically the same thing as in hmm but the variables some of them

624
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:36,320
以hmm为单位，但是其中一些变量可以是连续的或离散的

integrate them out by that's the Bayesian way okay so again this T naught

702
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,650
贝叶斯方法还可以，所以这又是什么，他们真的是隐藏变量
integrate them out by that's the Bayesian way okay so again this T naught

706
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,340
但是在这种情况下，他们只在乎洒水喷头，所以这就是

707
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:13,350
但是在这种情况下，他们只在乎洒水喷头，所以这就是
the sprinkler so this is where there are called my query or hidden variables this

708
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,010
叫我的查询或隐藏变量，这又被隐藏了，不在乎，所以我

756
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,369
真正执行所有这些求和是一项艰巨的任务，好吧，所以
dimensions if it is in fifty dimensions really performing all these summations

757
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:54,060
真正执行所有这些求和是一项艰巨的任务，好吧，所以
really performing all these summations it's a if they're expensive task okay so

758
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,070
真正执行所有这些求和是一项艰巨的任务，好吧，所以
it's a if they're expensive task okay so keep that in mind

759
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,580
记在脑子里
it's a if they're expensive task okay so keep that in mind

760
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,899
所以再次针对这个特殊情况可能会让您知道一些
it's a if they're expensive task okay so keep that in mind

761
00:27:58,899 --> 00:27:58,909
所以再次针对这个特殊情况可能会让您知道一些


762
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:04,940
所以再次针对这个特殊情况可能会让您知道一些
so again for this particular probably might give you you know some of the

763
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:04,950
所以再次针对这个特殊情况可能会让您知道一些
might give you you know some of the calculations I think they were contained

764
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,560
我认为这些计算也包含在上一张幻灯片中，因此
might give you you know some of the calculations I think they were contained

765
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,950
我认为这些计算也包含在上一张幻灯片中，因此
calculations I think they were contained also in the previous slide so

766
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:08,960
我认为这些计算也包含在上一张幻灯片中，因此
also in the previous slide so effectively what you do is you plug in

767
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,049
有效地做的是插入变量的联合分布
also in the previous slide so effectively what you do is you plug in

768
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:13,840
有效地做的是插入变量的联合分布
effectively what you do is you plug in the Joint Distribution of the variables

769
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:13,850
有效地做的是插入变量的联合分布
the Joint Distribution of the variables you plug in the values of s and W that

770
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:17,180
您插入您感兴趣的s和W的值，然后您必须
the Joint Distribution of the variables you plug in the values of s and W that

771
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,609
您插入您感兴趣的s和W的值，然后您必须
you plug in the values of s and W that your of interest and then you have to

772
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:19,619
您插入您感兴趣的s和W的值，然后您必须
your of interest and then you have to sum over all the possible values of

773
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:22,159
将这些阴天和雨的所有可能值相加
your of interest and then you have to sum over all the possible values of

774
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,470
将这些阴天和雨的所有可能值相加
sum over all the possible values of these cloudy and rain

775
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480
将这些阴天和雨的所有可能值相加
these cloudy and rain so this summations each of these

776
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,960
因此，这些求和值每个都取两个值的总和
these cloudy and rain so this summations each of these

777
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,879
因此，这些求和值每个都取两个值的总和
so this summations each of these variables which say takes two values all

778
00:28:28,879 --> 00:28:28,889
因此，这些求和值每个都取两个值的总和
variables which say takes two values all along so you're going to have terms that

779
00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:31,789
这样，您将拥有与这四个词一样大的术语，
variables which say takes two values all along so you're going to have terms that

780
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:35,299
这样，您将拥有与这四个词一样大的术语，
along so you're going to have terms that are as big as this so four terms and

781
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:35,309
这样，您将拥有与这四个词一样大的术语，
are as big as this so four terms and then I feel you're gonna have eight

782
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:37,519
那我觉得你会有八个词，所以一般来说
are as big as this so four terms and then I feel you're gonna have eight

783
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:46,549
那我觉得你会有八个词，所以一般来说
then I feel you're gonna have eight terms so generally if the body of this

784
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:46,559
那我觉得你会有八个词，所以一般来说
terms so generally if the body of this table if the favors are obviously the

785
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,070
如果青睐显然是当前离散变量的表，那是一个非常

786
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,320
如果青睐显然是当前离散变量的表，那是一个非常

790
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:55,350
容易的问题好多年解决了一个问题
there is a problem solved out the years ago so there's really no interest to do

791
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,859
以前所以真的没有兴趣进行任何研究，然后您就可以了

any research right then you take this because the money curves except in our

794
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:01,549
因为除了现在的情节以外，货币曲线至少现在分布

799
00:29:09,739 --> 00:29:09,749
有点被遗忘了我想相信所有事情都已经完成了
that everything has been done also thirty forty years ago

800
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,119
三十四十年了，所以没有什么不只是为了
that everything has been done also thirty forty years ago

801
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,830
三十四十年了，所以没有什么不只是为了

832
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:07,540
没有什么可以阻止我的，因为这种例子是
because this sort of this examples were built on lots more complicated graphs as

833
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,740
在我们学习过程中建立在许多更复杂的图形上，所以让我说
because this sort of this examples were built on lots more complicated graphs as

834
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,960
在我们学习过程中建立在许多更复杂的图形上，所以让我说

835
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:14,970
在我们学习过程中建立在许多更复杂的图形上，所以让我说
we go along in the course so let's say I have two discrete variables X 1 and X 2

836
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,390
有两个离散变量X 1和X 2，它们形成了一个多诺丽分布

839
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,490
因此他们可以接受每个人可以接受不同的值
and they form a multi noni distribution so they can take each of them can take

840
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,000
因此他们可以接受每个人可以接受不同的值
so they can take each of them can take take different values each of these

841
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,010
因此他们可以接受每个人可以接受不同的值
take different values each of these values with probability mu I for the sum

842
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,000
持有总和的概率为mu I的值等于R，因此您可以

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,550
持有总和的概率为mu I的值等于R，因此您可以

844
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:35,560
持有总和的概率为mu I的值等于R，因此您可以
of holding is equal to R so you can think you know this is a generalization

这个轴在0 1上正确，所以我们发送了每个植物学家，但是这个身体
this axis right on 0 1 alright so we send each of the botanist but this body

859
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,000
这个轴在0 1上正确，所以我们发送了每个植物学家，但是这个身体
send each of the botanist but this body was to take with probabilities mu i all

860
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,670
我要带着概率我可以
send each of the botanist but this body was to take with probabilities mu i all

我要带着概率我可以
right is the only one but you don't know which

863
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,030
是唯一的一个，但是您不知道K个变量中的哪个处于活动状态，所以我们
right is the only one but you don't know which

是唯一的一个，但是您不知道K个变量中的哪个处于活动状态，所以我们
is the only one but you don't know which of the K variables is active so what we

865
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:23,740
是唯一的一个，但是您不知道K个变量中的哪个处于活动状态，所以我们
of the K variables is active so what we do here you notice is this is the joint

866
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,280
在这里您会注意到这是联合分布的概率
of the K variables is active so what we do here you notice is this is the joint

867
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,700
在这里您会注意到这是联合分布的概率
do here you notice is this is the joint distribution the probability of this

868
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:29,710
在这里您会注意到这是联合分布的概率
distribution the probability of this take the value I and still manage the

取值I并仍管理排除theta值J，我们称之为V IJ
take the value I and still manage the exclude theta value J we call it V IJ

871
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:34,830
取值I并仍管理排除theta值J，我们称之为V IJ
exclude theta value J we call it V IJ right so this is the joint probability

872
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,700
是的，所以这是在此仅具有值R的联合概率
exclude theta value J we call it V IJ right so this is the joint probability

873
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,440
是的，所以这是在此仅具有值R的联合概率
right so this is the joint probability that this just has the value R in this

874
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:40,450
是的，所以这是在此仅具有值R的联合概率

关于210减去r的流量
and then we will discuss what this is about

952
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:36,129
关于210减去r的流量
about what is the 210 minus r oncoming flow to

956
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:39,980
请描述每个分布，抱歉，因为这是两个分布的乘积
because this is the product of two independent solutions of x1 x2 how many

values from a parameter need for each of this individual product terms and it

960
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,510
这个单独的产品条款，现在十年来就减了一个
values from a parameter need for each of this individual product terms and it

961
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,409
这个单独的产品条款，现在十年来就减了一个
this individual product terms and it came minus one right here 10 years

962
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:52,419
这个单独的产品条款，现在十年来就减了一个
came minus one right here 10 years normalization of each of the P of x1 pfx

963
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:55,510
对x1 pfx的每个P进行归一化，这样k减去1，然后我得到两个
came minus one right here 10 years normalization of each of the P of x1 pfx

964
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,910
对x1 pfx的每个P进行归一化，这样k减去1，然后我得到两个
normalization of each of the P of x1 pfx do so k minus 1 and then I have two

965
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:57,920
对x1 pfx的每个P进行归一化，这样k减去1，然后我得到两个
do so k minus 1 and then I have two blocks so the new essentially means that

966
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,630
阻止，所以新的本质上意味着当我拥有它时，符号尚不清楚
do so k minus 1 and then I have two blocks so the new essentially means that

967
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,789
阻止，所以新的本质上意味着当我拥有它时，符号尚不清楚
blocks so the new essentially means that when I have it the notation is not clear

968
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:03,799
阻止，所以新的本质上意味着当我拥有它时，符号尚不清楚
when I have it the notation is not clear of saying that chuan has it song lyrics

969
00:35:03,799 --> 00:35:06,190
说到chuan拥有自己的歌词，你会发现
when I have it the notation is not clear of saying that chuan has it song lyrics

970
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,510
说到chuan拥有自己的歌词，你会发现
of saying that chuan has it song lyrics to has its own new you see that

971
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,260
是的
of saying that chuan has it song lyrics to has its own new you see that

972
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:12,270
是的


973
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:17,710
是的
yes No

974
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,890
所以基本上这个原理是一样的所以x1可以取一个状态
yes No

975
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:20,900
所以基本上这个原理是一样的所以x1可以取一个状态


976
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:27,780
所以基本上这个原理是一样的所以x1可以取一个状态
so basically this works the same is this equation right so x1 can take a states

977
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:27,790
所以基本上这个原理是一样的所以x1可以取一个状态
equation right so x1 can take a states each of this case 2 I is with four

978
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:31,630
在这种情况下，每个案例2我都有4个提交对象，所以我们说
equation right so x1 can take a states each of this case 2 I is with four

979
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,950
在这种情况下，每个案例2我都有4个提交对象，所以我们说
each of this case 2 I is with four committed in the I so let's say for

980
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:32,960
在这种情况下，每个案例2我都有4个提交对象，所以我们说
committed in the I so let's say for example that this was a mining anything

981
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,690
例如，这是在附近土地上采矿的任何东西，那么它将是
committed in the I so let's say for example that this was a mining anything

982
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,490
例如，这是在附近土地上采矿的任何东西，那么它将是
example that this was a mining anything right so near land it would be the

983
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:36,500
例如，这是在附近土地上采矿的任何东西，那么它将是
right so near land it would be the probability of x1 is during minute 2

984
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,280
x1的概率在2分钟内，即1减去b1，即概率
right so near land it would be the probability of x1 is during minute 2

985
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,920
x1的概率在2分钟内，即1减去b1，即概率
probability of x1 is during minute 2 which is 1 minus b1 that the probability

986
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:41,930
x1的概率在2分钟内，即1减去b1，即概率
which is 1 minus b1 that the probability equal to 1 but Sarah have a of those

987
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,930
等于1，但是莎拉（Sarah）处于那个阶段，所以我喜欢所有人
which is 1 minus b1 that the probability equal to 1 but Sarah have a of those

988
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,660
等于1，但是莎拉（Sarah）处于那个阶段，所以我喜欢所有人
equal to 1 but Sarah have a of those stage so I like all of them like that

989
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:46,670
等于1，但是莎拉（Sarah）处于那个阶段，所以我喜欢所有人
stage so I like all of them like that and because I have K State's and K news

990
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:50,730
因为我有K State和K新闻，所以我们必须要某人，所以我真的有
stage so I like all of them like that and because I have K State's and K news

991
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:55,240
因为我有K State和K新闻，所以我们必须要某人，所以我真的有
and because I have K State's and K news they we have to someone so I really have

992
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:55,250
因为我有K State和K新闻，所以我们必须要某人，所以我真的有
they we have to someone so I really have K minus 1 K minus 1 parameters okay so I

993
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,750
K减1 K减1参数好，所以我有K减十二参数
they we have to someone so I really have K minus 1 K minus 1 parameters okay so I

994
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,430
K减1 K减1参数好，所以我有K减十二参数
K minus 1 K minus 1 parameters okay so I have K minus twelve parameter the

995
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:00,440
K减1 K减1参数好，所以我有K减十二参数
have K minus twelve parameter the implication is that this term use are

996
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,490
含义是，此词的用法现在有所不同，所以这是正确的，所以
have K minus twelve parameter the implication is that this term use are

997
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:07,930
含义是，此词的用法现在有所不同，所以这是正确的，所以
implication is that this term use are different now this is a thing right so

998
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:07,940
含义是，此词的用法现在有所不同，所以这是正确的，所以
different now this is a thing right so you know this year I you know for

999
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:12,040
你知道今年，你知道这个独立的例子
different now this is a thing right so you know this year I you know for

1000
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,900
你知道今年，你知道这个独立的例子
you know this year I you know for example for this independent

1001
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:13,910
你知道今年，你知道这个独立的例子
example for this independent distribution have it like that if you

1002
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,210
如果您有LM的一般发行版，则具有类似的发行版

1003
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,830
如果您有LM的一般发行版，则具有类似的发行版
distribution have it like that if you have a general distribution of LM

1004
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:17,840
如果您有LM的一般发行版，则具有类似的发行版
have a general distribution of LM variables basically the total number of

1005
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:23,470
变量基本上参数的总数是K到N减去1全部
have a general distribution of LM variables basically the total number of

1007
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:27,020
变量基本上参数的总数是K到N减去1全部
parameters is K to the N minus 1 all right this is similar to what we had

1008
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,110
对，这类似于我们在这里拥有的，所以我们有两个值k square-
parameters is K to the N minus 1 all right this is similar to what we had

1009
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,390
对，这类似于我们在这里拥有的，所以我们有两个值k square-
right this is similar to what we had here so we have two values k square-

1010
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:31,400
对，这类似于我们在这里拥有的，所以我们有两个值k square-
here so we have two values k square- want for them to be K to the M minus 1

1011
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,330
希望他们是K到M减去1，所以对于实际来说这太快了
here so we have two values k square- want for them to be K to the M minus 1

1012
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,060
希望他们是K到M减去1，所以对于实际来说这太快了
want for them to be K to the M minus 1 so this is gross too fast for actually

1013
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,070
希望他们是K到M减去1，所以对于实际来说这太快了
so this is gross too fast for actually being able to do anything

1014
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,290
如果值是独立的，则现在可以执行任何操作
so this is gross too fast for actually being able to do anything

1015
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,260
如果值是独立的，则现在可以执行任何操作
being able to do anything now if the values are independent the

1016
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:41,270
如果值是独立的，则现在可以执行任何操作
now if the values are independent the novel problem should be K minus 1 for

1017
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,450
新问题的分布时间M应该为K减1，因此非常小
now if the values are independent the novel problem should be K minus 1 for

1018
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,900
新问题的分布时间M应该为K减1，因此非常小

00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:46,910
新问题的分布时间M应该为K减1，因此非常小
its distribution times M so very small number and if I have a Markov chain

1020
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:51,840
数字，如果我有一个马尔可夫链，其中所有内容都定义在

1023
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,770
X i的该条件分布的项仅给出了先前的值，因此
alright where everything is defined in terms of this conditional distributions

1025
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,450
X i的该条件分布的项仅给出了先前的值，因此
of X i given only the previous value so this is a first-order Markov chain it

1026
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,200
这是一阶马尔可夫链，表示参数总数

says that the total number of parameters is K minus 1 plus n minus 1 K K minus 1

1029
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,170
是K减1加n减1 KK减1，然后告诉我它在那说什么

to describe the Joint Distribution you need to start with P of x1 and then P of

1041
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,580
需要以x1的P开头，然后X的P将给出下一个100 P或给定的53

1044
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,100
x2等等，所以P反映了一个K减去它在哪里的小变量，然后我
X will give the next 100 P or 53 given x2 etc so P reflects one has K minus

1045
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,950

00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,000
有条件的分配以及在这种情况下我需要多少个身体
how many body must I need for this case here and K any K square minus K because

1053
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,540
这里，K是任何K平方减去K，因为这种分布具有许多影响，我
how many body must I need for this case here and K any K square minus K because

1054
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,390
这里，K是任何K平方减去K，因为这种分布具有许多影响，我
here and K any K square minus K because this distribution for its many effects I

1055
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:04,400
这里，K是任何K平方减去K，因为这种分布具有许多影响，我
this distribution for its many effects I minus one has to sum to one and I have

1056
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,930
减一必须加和为一，而我有XI减1的三个值，所以K
this distribution for its many effects I minus one has to sum to one and I have

1057
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:11,860
减一必须加和为一，而我有XI减1的三个值，所以K
minus one has to sum to one and I have three values of X I minus 1 so the K

1058
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:11,870
减一必须加和为一，而我有XI减1的三个值，所以K
three values of X I minus 1 so the K squared minus K okay for a Markov chain

1059
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:18,460
减去负K的平方对于一个马尔可夫链基本上可以看到，成本是线性的

减去负K的平方对于一个马尔可夫链基本上可以看到，成本是线性的
basically you can see the cost is linear in M you can see here K 2 parallel

1062
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,610
在M中，您可以在这里看到K 2并行，这不是很好
basically you can see the cost is linear in M you can see here K 2 parallel

1063
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,860
在M中，您可以在这里看到K 2并行，这不是很好

1064
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:26,870
在M中，您可以在这里看到K 2并行，这不是很好
alright that's not very good so this is sort of the most trivial case

1065
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,970
所以这是最简单的情况，而图表基本上是针对该情况
alright that's not very good so this is sort of the most trivial case

1066
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,650
所以这是最简单的情况，而图表基本上是针对该情况
so this is sort of the most trivial case and and the graph basically for that

1067
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:32,660
所以这是最简单的情况，而图表基本上是针对该情况
and and the graph basically for that looks like now I know some of you have I

1068

00:44:10,269 --> 00:44:10,279
分布好，我的意思是这当然是一个主要假设，但您可以
course a major assumption but you can appreciate the inference with one meal

1217
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:12,910
欣赏一顿饭的推论而不是与成千上万次的推论
course a major assumption but you can appreciate the inference with one meal

1218
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,430
欣赏一顿饭的推论而不是与成千上万次的推论
appreciate the inference with one meal versus doing influence with thousands of

1219
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:15,440
欣赏一顿饭的推论而不是与成千上万次的推论
versus doing influence with thousands of gnu's

1220
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:15,700
gnu没事，所以参数的时间
versus doing influence with thousands of gnu's

1221
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,870
gnu没事，所以参数的时间
gnu's okay all right so time of the parameters

1222
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:18,880
gnu没事，所以参数的时间
okay all right so time of the parameters makes things extremely late so I think

1223
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:28,719
使事情变得非常晚，所以我认为也许在处理过程中
okay all right so time of the parameters makes things extremely late so I think

1224
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:31,089
使事情变得非常晚，所以我认为也许在处理过程中
makes things extremely late so I think maybe in the processing we maybe

1225
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:31,099
使事情变得非常晚，所以我认为也许在处理过程中
maybe in the processing we maybe advocated this problem and we said is

00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:33,819
提倡这个问题，我们说在这个问题上不会经常出现

00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:36,140
提倡这个问题，我们说在这个问题上不会经常出现
not going to be here so often in this course but let me use this as a sort of

1229
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,870
当然，但让我用它作为反例，所以假设我们有M
not going to be here so often in this course but let me use this as a sort of

course but let me use this as a sort of a counter example so let's say we have M

1231
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:40,609
当然，但让我用它作为反例，所以假设我们有M
a counter example so let's say we have M variables again that they are discrete

1232
00:44:40,609 --> 00:44:42,249
变量又是离散的，每个变量可以取K个不同的值

properties so you can see this this way or you can see it this way it is the

1357
00:49:10,769 --> 00:49:14,569
或者你可以这样看，是一样的事情
properties so you can see this this way or you can see it this way it is the

1358
00:49:14,569 --> 00:49:15,829
或者你可以这样看，是一样的事情
or you can see it this way it is the same thing okay

1359
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:15,839
或者你可以这样看，是一样的事情
same thing okay so linear motion because you know this

1360
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,700
线性运动，因为您知道这是平均值的线性函数
same thing okay so linear motion because you know this

1361
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,370
线性运动，因为您知道这是平均值的线性函数
so linear motion because you know this the in the mean is a linear function of

1362
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:22,380
线性运动，因为您知道这是平均值的线性函数
the in the mean is a linear function of the exist the linearity comes everywhere

1363

the in the mean is a linear function of the exist the linearity comes everywhere

1364
00:49:27,019 --> 00:49:29,329
线性到处都是高斯，因为不仅如此
the exist the linearity comes everywhere it's Gaussian because not only this

1365
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:29,339
线性到处都是高斯，因为不仅如此
it's Gaussian because not only this condition distribution of X i given the

1366
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:31,339
给定父级的X i的条件分布是向下壳，因此您可以
it's Gaussian because not only this condition distribution of X i given the

1367
00:49:31,339 --> 00:49:33,529
给定父级的X i的条件分布是向下壳，因此您可以
condition distribution of X i given the parent is down shell for that so you can

1368
00:49:33,529 --> 00:49:33,539
给定父级的X i的条件分布是向下壳，因此您可以
parent is down shell for that so you can so if you take all of these gardens you

1369
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:36,079
因此，如果您将所有这些花园都带走，则可以将它们彼此相乘
parent is down shell for that so you can so if you take all of these gardens you

1370
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,150
因此，如果您将所有这些花园都带走，则可以将它们彼此相乘
so if you take all of these gardens you multiply them with each other if you

1371
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:38,160
因此，如果您将所有这些花园都带走，则可以将它们彼此相乘
multiply them with each other if you expand and then you close the square as

1372
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,279

a quadratic I mean and I again I am NOT doing the algebra because it's not water

1378
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:50,989
进行代数运算是因为它不是水，但是如果您正确地使用原木并且您

1383
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:58,650
得出所有这些分布的乘积成为
distributions becomes summation of the logs and then you get this squares and

1384
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:00,799
日志，然后得到这个正方形，如果扩大它们，基本上可以得到
distributions becomes summation of the logs and then you get this squares and

1385
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:03,289
日志，然后得到这个正方形，如果扩大它们，基本上可以得到

日志，然后得到这个正方形，如果扩大它们，基本上可以得到
if you expand them you can basically get a square for to fit that they're

1387
00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:05,690
一个适合他们是多元高斯的平方，所以这导致
if you expand them you can basically get a square for to fit that they're

1388
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:09,259
一个适合他们是多元高斯的平方，所以这导致
a square for to fit that they're multivariate gaussian so this leads to

1389
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:09,269
一个适合他们是多元高斯的平方，所以这导致
multivariate gaussian so this leads to the multivariate Gaussian so the problem

1390
00:50:09,269 --> 00:50:14,809
多元高斯，所以这里的问题是我们想要这个图，但是
multivariate gaussian so this leads to the multivariate Gaussian so the problem

1391
00:50:14,809 --> 00:50:17,150
多元高斯，所以这里的问题是我们想要这个图，但是
the multivariate Gaussian so the problem here is we want for this graph but is

00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:39,200
XX减去XI XJ，所以请注意这里是城市衰落的aj
here there's a j from the urban decay that are the parlance of j and then

1455
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,740
是j的说法，然后有一个额外的对，就是另一个
here there's a j from the urban decay that are the parlance of j and then

1456
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,070

that are the parlance of j and then there is an extra pair that is another

1457
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:45,080
是j的说法，然后有一个额外的对，就是另一个
there is an extra pair that is another function alright so a equal to RF i and

1458
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,440
函数正常，所以等于RF i和j等于，否则0的平方根
there is an extra pair that is another function alright so a equal to RF i and

to have VI VJ and when i like the situation I forgot to maybe to put this

1464
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:01,270
这种情况我忘了也许将它放在上一张幻灯片中，这是给我的
to have VI VJ and when i like the situation I forgot to maybe to put this

00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:03,290
这种情况我忘了也许将它放在上一张幻灯片中，这是给我的
from the previous slide this is for I less or equal to J so you may want to

1467
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:06,250
小于或等于J，因此您可能想取和
from the previous slide this is for I less or equal to J so you may want to

equation alright doesn't ask you this or I don't know if he does anything they

1482
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:40,919
我不知道他是否做过任何事，他们说可以证明一切正常，所以如果您
equation alright doesn't ask you this or I don't know if he does anything they

1483
00:53:40,919 --> 00:53:46,499
我不知道他是否做过任何事，他们说可以证明一切正常，所以如果您
I don't know if he does anything they say prove it okay all right so if you

1484
00:53:46,499 --> 00:53:46,509
我不知道他是否做过任何事，他们说可以证明一切正常，所以如果您
say prove it okay all right so if you want to prove it so if you want the

1485
00:53:46,509 --> 00:53:49,529
想证明这一点，如果您想通过定义来定义XI XJ的协方差为
say prove it okay all right so if you want to prove it so if you want the

1486
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:52,319
想证明这一点，如果您想通过定义来定义XI XJ的协方差为

covariance of X I XJ by definition is this

1488
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:52,829
这就像XY减去X的平均值
covariance of X I XJ by definition is this

1489
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:55,380
这就像XY减去X的平均值
this it's like if XY minus the mean of X

1490
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:55,390
这就像XY减去X的平均值
it's like if XY minus the mean of X sorry XJ minus the mean of XJ I'm using

1491

我有骨灰盒的线性起始点，我要减去XI的均值，
and I'm subtracting the means of X I and XJ and basically I stopped invest and he

1497
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:14,159
XJ和我基本上停止了投资，而他会在今年秋天采取这种情况
and I'm subtracting the means of X I and XJ and basically I stopped invest and he

XJ和我基本上停止了投资，而他会在今年秋天采取这种情况
will take this fall will case amount of jail ok so now I'm going to have a

1500
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:24,359
监狱好吧，现在我将对j WJ k和
will take this fall will case amount of jail ok so now I'm going to have a

00:54:28,229 --> 00:54:28,239
监狱好吧，现在我将对j WJ k和
summation of the points of j WJ k and then i'm going to have the expectation

1503
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:30,870
那么我将对这个括号有个期望，最后想到的是
summation of the points of j WJ k and then i'm going to have the expectation

1504
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,789
那么我将对这个括号有个期望，最后想到的是
then i'm going to have the expectation of this parentheses final thought is the

1505
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:32,799
那么我将对这个括号有个期望，最后想到的是
of this parentheses final thought is the covariance of X I X K so the first times

1506
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:36,630
XIXK的协方差，所以第一次出现

1508
00:54:40,529 --> 00:54:40,539
XIXK的协方差，所以第一次出现
that is it there and then there is the expectation of this parentheses times

1509
00:54:40,539 --> 00:54:42,620
如果她会说，括号的期望乘以这个术语所涉及的时间
that is it there and then there is the expectation of this parentheses times

1510
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,409
如果她会说，括号的期望乘以这个术语所涉及的时间
expectation of this parentheses times this term that involves if she'll say

如果她会说，括号的期望乘以这个术语所涉及的时间
this term that involves if she'll say all right and if the previous equation

1512
00:54:45,419 --> 00:54:51,149
好的，如果前面的方程式平方但期望的进度需要
this term that involves if she'll say all right and if the previous equation

1513
00:54:51,149 --> 00:54:53,969
好的，如果前面的方程式平方但期望的进度需要
all right and if the previous equation square but progress of expectation needs

way that I have been able to actually prove this is sort of doing it

1518
00:55:00,669 --> 00:55:03,749
证明这是一种递归的方式，所以如果你们来
way that I have been able to actually prove this is sort of doing it

1519
00:55:03,749 --> 00:55:06,870
证明这是一种递归的方式，所以如果你们来
prove this is sort of doing it recursively okay so if you guys come up

1520
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:06,880
证明这是一种递归的方式，所以如果你们来
recursively okay so if you guys come up with a cleaner way not only you send me

1521
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,289
用一种更清洁的方式，不仅您给了我正确的证明，而且还向我发送了

1532
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:25,359
推导，所以我们又想拉这个x naught的期望是
the expectation of this x naught is equal to that and the way that I do it

1533
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,839
等于那个，而我做的方式是我写了我们原著的其余部分
the expectation of this x naught is equal to that and the way that I do it

1725
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:35,800
好吧，好吧，所以从这个节点和父母基本上会做的不是
values of each node okay so okay so from this node and the

1726
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,780
好吧，好吧，所以从这个节点和父母基本上会做的不是
okay so okay so from this node and the parents basically would have done is not

1727
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:37,790
好吧，好吧，所以从这个节点和父母基本上会做的不是
parents basically would have done is not subtracting the mean okay and so this is

1728
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:40,690
减去均值就可以了，所以这与我拥有的方程式相似
parents basically would have done is not subtracting the mean okay and so this is

1729
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:42,190
减去均值就可以了，所以这与我拥有的方程式相似

01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:48,200
这杯酒，他们基本上了解回归，这就是力量
this glass before and they know about regression basically this is the power

2042
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:48,210
这杯酒，他们基本上了解回归，这就是力量
regression basically this is the power the Joint Distribution is the player

2043
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,630
联合发行人是玩家，这是您可以想到的写照
regression basically this is the power the Joint Distribution is the player

2044
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:52,980
联合发行人是玩家，这是您可以想到的写照
the Joint Distribution is the player this is you can think of this portray

2045
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:52,990
联合发行人是玩家，这是您可以想到的写照
this is you can think of this portray the Joint Distribution as the UH

2046
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:54,870
UH对工作室进行归一化可以很好地进行联合发行，所以
this is you can think of this portray the Joint Distribution as the UH

2047
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:59,100
UH对工作室进行归一化可以很好地进行联合发行，所以
the Joint Distribution as the UH normalize for studio all right okay so

2048
01:15:59,100 --> 01:15:59,110
UH对工作室进行归一化可以很好地进行联合发行，所以
normalize for studio all right okay so it is the prior the depends on Alpha

2049
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:02,150
这是之前依赖Alpha的部分，例如那部分锁定，然后
normalize for studio all right okay so it is the prior the depends on Alpha

2050
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:05,610
这是之前依赖Alpha的部分，例如那部分锁定，然后
it is the prior the depends on Alpha like that that part of it lock and then

2051
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:05,620
这是之前依赖Alpha的部分，例如那部分锁定，然后
like that that part of it lock and then you have the right we could model that

2052
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:07,980
您有权利，我们可以进行建模，从而为您提供TN的概率
like that that part of it lock and then you have the right we could model that

2053
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,260
您有权利，我们可以进行建模，从而为您提供TN的概率
you have the right we could model that gives you the probability of TN give an

2054
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:10,270
您有权利，我们可以进行建模，从而为您提供TN的概率
gives you the probability of TN give an extent but that probability depends of

2055
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:12,300
范围，但该概率取决于噪声Sigma平方和函数
gives you the probability of TN give an extent but that probability depends of

2056
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,280
范围，但该概率取决于噪声Sigma平方和函数
extent but that probability depends of the noise Sigma square and the function

2057
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:14,290
范围，但该概率取决于噪声Sigma平方和函数
the noise Sigma square and the function W so effectively we don't have to write

2058
01:16:14,290 --> 01:16:20,400
如此有效，如果我看着这个，我们不必写这个冗长的方程式
the noise Sigma square and the function W so effectively we don't have to write

2059
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,340
如此有效，如果我看着这个，我们不必写这个冗长的方程式
W so effectively we don't have to write this lengthy equation if I look at this

2060
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:23,350
如此有效，如果我看着这个，我们不必写这个冗长的方程式
this lengthy equation if I look at this graph I know what is going on and I know

2061
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:25,830
图，我知道发生了什么，我知道问题出在哪里，这就是为什么何时
this lengthy equation if I look at this graph I know what is going on and I know

2062
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,990
图，我知道发生了什么，我知道问题出在哪里，这就是为什么何时
graph I know what is going on and I know where the problem is and that's why when

2063
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:28,000
图，我知道发生了什么，我知道问题出在哪里，这就是为什么何时
where the problem is and that's why when you've got the homework problem Subic

2064
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,430
你有家庭作业的问题苏比克说他们知道一切，所以让我给
where the problem is and that's why when you've got the homework problem Subic

2065
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:32,160
你有家庭作业的问题苏比克说他们知道一切，所以让我给
you've got the homework problem Subic said they know everything so let me give

2066
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:32,170
你有家庭作业的问题苏比克说他们知道一切，所以让我给
said they know everything so let me give the report then you figure out what it

2067
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:34,080
报告，然后您弄清楚这意味着什么，这是一个方程式，这是一个
said they know everything so let me give the report then you figure out what it

2068
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,480
报告，然后您弄清楚这意味着什么，这是一个方程式，这是一个
the report then you figure out what it means says here is an equation here's a

2069
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:36,490
报告，然后您弄清楚这意味着什么，这是一个方程式，这是一个
means says here is an equation here's a plot going away the problem to do this

2070
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:39,360
情节消失解决这个问题好吗，所以基本上我们需要什么程序
means says here is an equation here's a plot going away the problem to do this

2071
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,880
情节消失解决这个问题好吗，所以基本上我们需要什么程序
plot going away the problem to do this okay so what program basically we need

2072
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:41,890
情节消失解决这个问题好吗，所以基本上我们需要什么程序
okay so what program basically we need to require that you understand that this

2073
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:44,190
要求您了解此图表示现在所有这些都可以
okay so what program basically we need to require that you understand that this

2074
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:48,600
要求您了解此图表示现在所有这些都可以
to require that you understand that this graph implies all of this ok now in

2075
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:48,610
要求您了解此图表示现在所有这些都可以
graph implies all of this ok now in is there is nothing for predictions

2076
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:53,129
没有什么可以预测的，基本上只有信息
graph implies all of this ok now in is there is nothing for predictions

2077
01:16:53,129 --> 01:16:55,950
没有什么可以预测的，基本上只有信息
is there is nothing for predictions basically it has only the information

2078
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:55,960
没有什么可以预测的，基本上只有信息
basically it has only the information the values for training the T values and

2079
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:59,339
用于训练T值和X值的海啸之前的值，但是
basically it has only the information the values for training the T values and

2080
01:16:59,339 --> 01:17:03,149
用于训练T值和X值的海啸之前的值，但是
the values for training the T values and the X values the prior tsunami but

2081
01:17:03,149 --> 01:17:03,159
用于训练T值和X值的海啸之前的值，但是
the X values the prior tsunami but there's nothing of prediction so if you

2082
01:17:03,159 --> 01:17:04,560
没有任何预测，所以如果您想添加一些东西进行预测，那么
the X values the prior tsunami but there's nothing of prediction so if you

2083
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,589
没有任何预测，所以如果您想添加一些东西进行预测，那么
there's nothing of prediction so if you want to add things for prediction so

2084
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:07,599
没有任何预测，所以如果您想添加一些东西进行预测，那么
want to add things for prediction so don't let's say not going to train the

2085
01:17:07,599 --> 01:17:10,379
别说不去训练模型，今天也要训练新的X
want to add things for prediction so don't let's say not going to train the

2086
01:17:10,379 --> 01:17:13,260
别说不去训练模型，今天也要训练新的X
don't let's say not going to train the model but also today both for a new X to

2087
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:13,270
别说不去训练模型，今天也要训练新的X
model but also today both for a new X to predict what the value of the function

2088
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:16,260
预测功能的价值是心脏这是整个图
model but also today both for a new X to predict what the value of the function

2089
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:19,410
预测功能的价值是心脏这是整个图
predict what the value of the function is the heart this is the whole diagram

2090
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:19,420
预测功能的价值是心脏这是整个图
is the heart this is the whole diagram that includes the joint probability

2091
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:22,410
包括所有事物的联合概率分布，所以
is the heart this is the whole diagram that includes the joint probability

2092
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:24,810
包括所有事物的联合概率分布，所以
that includes the joint probability distribution of everything so the

2093
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:24,820
包括所有事物的联合概率分布，所以
distribution of everything so the distribution of W the take data that you

2094
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:29,069
W的分布，您给出的汇整数据以及您的预测T
distribution of everything so the distribution of W the take data that you

2095
01:17:29,069 --> 01:17:31,260
W的分布，您给出的汇整数据以及您的预测T
distribution of W the take data that you gave but also the prediction T that you

2096
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:31,270
W的分布，您给出的汇整数据以及您的预测T
gave but also the prediction T that you want to do at that point X and you

2097
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:34,229
想要在X点做，您会发现它包含ANOVA谎言
gave but also the prediction T that you want to do at that point X and you

2098
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:37,140
想要在X点做，您会发现它包含ANOVA谎言
want to do at that point X and you notice it contains the ANOVA lies

2099
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:37,150
想要在X点做，您会发现它包含ANOVA谎言
notice it contains the ANOVA lies posterior which is the prior times the

2100
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:40,319
后验，这是先前的可能性再次出现的可能性
notice it contains the ANOVA lies posterior which is the prior times the

2101
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:42,330
后验，这是先前的可能性再次出现的可能性
posterior which is the prior times the likelihood all right this comes again

2102
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:42,340
后验，这是先前的可能性再次出现的可能性
likelihood all right this comes again from what we did before but also now it

2103
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:45,120
从我们以前做过的事情到现在都有的事情，所以这是您所知道的
likelihood all right this comes again from what we did before but also now it

2104
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,450
从我们以前做过的事情到现在都有的事情，所以这是您所知道的
from what we did before but also now it has so this is sort of where you know

2105
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:48,460
从我们以前做过的事情到现在都有的事情，所以这是您所知道的
has so this is sort of where you know the posterior value you literally times

2106
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:51,689
您的后验值实际上乘以可能性与可能性的乘积
has so this is sort of where you know the posterior value you literally times

2107
01:17:51,689 --> 01:17:54,359
您的后验值实际上乘以可能性与可能性的乘积
the posterior value you literally times the likelihood okay and the likelihood

2108
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:54,369
您的后验值实际上乘以可能性与可能性的乘积
the likelihood okay and the likelihood from the prediction point is between UW

2109
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:57,810
从预测的角度来看，在UW和她之间
the likelihood okay and the likelihood from the prediction point is between UW

2110
01:17:57,810 --> 01:18:01,110
从预测的角度来看，在UW和她之间
from the prediction point is between UW and she was square for my
