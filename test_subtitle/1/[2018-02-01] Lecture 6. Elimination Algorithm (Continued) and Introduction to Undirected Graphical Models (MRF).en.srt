1
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,020
I sent an email with a very long attachments and the noise you guys

2
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,240
attachments and the noise you guys receiveth it were true

3
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,000
receiveth it were true okay that is the the best reading

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,590
okay that is the the best reading basically improbably free graphical

5
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,480
basically improbably free graphical models that I know Elementary in some

6
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,300
models that I know Elementary in some sense but standard if you see pixels

7
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,960
sense but standard if you see pixels missing

8
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,670
missing don't start sending me all you know that

9
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,580
don't start sending me all you know that page is missing well that page missing

10
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,670
page is missing well that page missing because it's missing right that's what

11
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,760
because it's missing right that's what happens when you download income China

12
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,370
happens when you download income China okay some pages are missing

13
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,100
okay some pages are missing I'm just kidding but you know some pages

14
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,890
I'm just kidding but you know some pages don't exist actually

15
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,180
don't exist actually okay the offer has not completed them

16
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,760
okay the offer has not completed them yet especially energy to things like

17
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,030
yet especially energy to things like that

18
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,520
that alright so what I think I realize we're

19
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,729
alright so what I think I realize we're going extremely slowly and maybe is

20
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,130
going extremely slowly and maybe is because I don't want the class to drop

21
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,820
because I don't want the class to drop it before even the first homework is due

22
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,650
it before even the first homework is due or something like that okay but for sure

23
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,270
or something like that okay but for sure we need to accelerate the homeworks

24
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,520
we need to accelerate the homeworks otherwise advanced years doing six for

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,789
otherwise advanced years doing six for multiservice year okay so next one work

26
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:49,220
multiservice year okay so next one work is view made basically you know

27
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:55,460
is view made basically you know okay like some logistics here on Friday

28
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,840
okay like some logistics here on Friday we're not gonna have recitation but

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,160
we're not gonna have recitation but Subic is going to be in this office in

30
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,020
Subic is going to be in this office in 311 Cushing 3 Devon I think it says

31
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,830
311 Cushing 3 Devon I think it says ethoxide 311 M ok during the election

32
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,390
ethoxide 311 M ok during the election time and the purpose of the homework is

33
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,850
time and the purpose of the homework is for everybody to do it even if we have

34
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,660
for everybody to do it even if we have to give you the solution ok so you

35
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,880
to give you the solution ok so you cannot leave basically the room on

36
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,600
cannot leave basically the room on Friday without having a solution down

37
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,160
Friday without having a solution down there is no sort of thing all it's a

38
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,480
there is no sort of thing all it's a difficult problem I will leave it for

39
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,800
difficult problem I will leave it for later we want you to do it even if that

40
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,220
later we want you to do it even if that means you asked him for the solution ok

41
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,260
means you asked him for the solution ok we want it done on Monday I'm away and

42
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,940
we want it done on Monday I'm away and Subic is going to give the recitation

43
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,030
Subic is going to give the recitation for homework to that we hope it would be

44
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,950
for homework to that we hope it would be posted this weekend okay so the very

45
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,140
posted this weekend okay so the very station for homework 2 on Monday and

46
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,430
station for homework 2 on Monday and then I will take the lecture on Friday

47
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,040
then I will take the lecture on Friday occasionally when I mean Thursday and

48
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,150
occasionally when I mean Thursday and Friday will give the lecture next week

49
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,600
Friday will give the lecture next week ok so what we do today is we need to

50
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,750
ok so what we do today is we need to discuss we need to go back to the

51
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,090
discuss we need to go back to the elimination algorithm poaches start off

52
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,720
elimination algorithm poaches start off very trivial but where we stopped was

53
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,150
very trivial but where we stopped was sort of to provide the graph theoretic

54
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,870
sort of to provide the graph theoretic approach to elimination I mean we said

55
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,110
approach to elimination I mean we said we eliminate now you know we saw mobile

56
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,770
we eliminate now you know we saw mobile the potential to depend on the variables

57
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,740
the potential to depend on the variables we eliminate but what is the right

58
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,720
we eliminate but what is the right ordering how we control the complexity

59
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,220
ordering how we control the complexity of the algorithm and how we do this

60
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,000
of the algorithm and how we do this purely using graph theoretic approaches

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,420
purely using graph theoretic approaches that has not been discussed so we me and

62
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,860
that has not been discussed so we me and we have summarized very briefly the

63
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,750
we have summarized very briefly the algorithms so we remember what we are

64
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,150
algorithms so we remember what we are talking okay so the elimination

65
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,310
talking okay so the elimination algorithm basically has the following

66
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,909
algorithm basically has the following steps the first step is realized

67
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:54,919


68
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:01,810
you have to choose some ordering where the query notes we want that you want

69
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,570
the query notes we want that you want basically to compute let's say the

70
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,450
basically to compute let's say the marginal of the last okay so the

71
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,840
marginal of the last okay so the ordering it starts out except F is the

72
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,000
ordering it starts out except F is the query notes appears the last and then

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,480
query notes appears the last and then you have to create a list of acting

74
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:18,490


75
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,110
potentials if you like and because this is a direct graph you go through each

76
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,930
is a direct graph you go through each node in the graph and you place all of

77
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,330
node in the graph and you place all of the conditional probabilities that

78
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,940
the conditional probabilities that define basically altogether the

79
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,230
define basically altogether the capitalization of the Joint Distribution

80
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,879
capitalization of the Joint Distribution you put them on what's called the

81
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:38,650
you put them on what's called the actively now in addition to those in the

82
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,890
actively now in addition to those in the second step when you call evidence you

83
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,230
second step when you call evidence you also put in the active list this

84
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,570
also put in the active list this evidence functions which were nothing

85
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,190
evidence functions which were nothing else present the functions of course

86
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,010
else present the functions of course this variable to take value five let's

87
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,000
this variable to take value five let's say right so so you don't really need to

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,830
say right so so you don't really need to have it explicitly but conceptualize

89
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,710
have it explicitly but conceptualize this this needs to come somewhere so if

90
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,650
this this needs to come somewhere so if you want it just a formal presentation

91
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,510
you want it just a formal presentation basically you need to put this evidence

92
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,310
basically you need to put this evidence function right in the active list in

93
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,190
function right in the active list in editions of this condition of potential

94
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,730
editions of this condition of potential okay and then following your elimination

95
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,580
okay and then following your elimination or the what you need to do is you have

96
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,360
or the what you need to do is you have to go to every node X I following hot or

97
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,610
to go to every node X I following hot or dry and you have to find all the

98
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,570
dry and you have to find all the potentials the depend on X high alright

99
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,080
potentials the depend on X high alright so basically this will be the evidence

100
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,529
so basically this will be the evidence functions would be X I depending on

101
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,140
functions would be X I depending on exponent the children depending on

102
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,830
exponent the children depending on excise the excise the parent etc okay

103
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,770
excise the excise the parent etc okay snow multiply all those together some

104
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,409
snow multiply all those together some elect I and then form a new potential

105
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:50,860
elect I and then form a new potential which we call it the X I and then place

106
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,890
which we call it the X I and then place this potential in the activity and all

107
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,990
this potential in the activity and all the other potentials basically that you

108
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,439
the other potentials basically that you introduced

109
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,469
introduced that involve its I will be removed from

110
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:02,540
that involve its I will be removed from the after this okay so you'll be sucked

111
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,059
the after this okay so you'll be sucked into this with the effect I and the last

112
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:07,519
into this with the effect I and the last step is basically if you want to

113
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,699
step is basically if you want to normalize you know you can do this by

114
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,399
normalize you know you can do this by summing over all possible values of the

115
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:19,040
summing over all possible values of the query variables now to be able to

116
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,739
query variables now to be able to introduce sort of a graph theoretic

117
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:24,019
introduce sort of a graph theoretic version of this algorithm unfortunately

118
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:25,879
version of this algorithm unfortunately we have to discuss a little bit on how

119
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,419
we have to discuss a little bit on how we do factorization in in undirected

120
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:31,839
we do factorization in in undirected graphs which is actually my next lecture

121
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,949
graphs which is actually my next lecture so I'm gonna be sort of the little

122
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:38,540
so I'm gonna be sort of the little header and go backwards right so you may

123
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,429
header and go backwards right so you may think education is a right thing to do

124
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:42,919
think education is a right thing to do but in life not everything is the right

125
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:45,769
but in life not everything is the right thing to do alright so doing some things

126
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:49,189
thing to do alright so doing some things how to fold the hem sometimes we need to

127
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:52,100
how to fold the hem sometimes we need to hear something flies in different order

128
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,230
hear something flies in different order that can be helpful as well okay so

129
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,239
that can be helpful as well okay so let's see where the situations so we're

130
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:01,429
let's see where the situations so we're going to discuss this elimination

131
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:04,009
going to discuss this elimination algorithm directed graphs and the only

132
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:05,899
algorithm directed graphs and the only thing that I want you to know which will

133
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:08,540
thing that I want you to know which will be actually on next lecture there is no

134
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,279
be actually on next lecture there is no conditional probabilities general

135
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,319
conditional probabilities general directed graphs the way we have them in

136
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,319
directed graphs the way we have them in directed graphs what you have is you

137
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,109
directed graphs what you have is you have potential over the status now you

138
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:20,809
have potential over the status now you have product of potentials over the sets

139
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:23,119
have product of potentials over the sets of interconnected nodes which we call

140
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:26,089
of interconnected nodes which we call them clicks okay and those potentials

141
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,079
them clicks okay and those potentials are not really probability distributions

142
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,399
are not really probability distributions all right which means they're not they

143
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,469
all right which means they're not they don't normalize or they don't have the

144
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:34,969
don't normalize or they don't have the physical meaning that the conditional

145
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:38,839
physical meaning that the conditional distributions have in in directed graphs

146
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,969
distributions have in in directed graphs so in this undirected graph here if you

147
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,059
so in this undirected graph here if you look for the number of cliques the

148
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,870
look for the number of cliques the maximal cliques that somebody can have

149
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,889
maximal cliques that somebody can have is you can see X 1 X 2 is a clique

150
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:57,650
is you can see X 1 X 2 is a clique they're connected X 1 X 3 is a clique X

151
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,189
they're connected X 1 X 3 is a clique X 3 X 5 is a trait X 2 X 5 and X 6 is a

152
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:02,259
3 X 5 is a trait X 2 X 5 and X 6 is a clique

153
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:07,419
clique and x2 x4 is actually okay X 1 X 2 X 5

154
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:10,480
and x2 x4 is actually okay X 1 X 2 X 5 it is not a clique because the X 1 and X

155
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,579
it is not a clique because the X 1 and X 5 are not connected okay so the maximal

156
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:17,199
5 are not connected okay so the maximal cliques are basically the ones that are

157
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:18,850
cliques are basically the ones that are listed here the only thing I want you to

158
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,869
listed here the only thing I want you to know in the context of undirected graphs

159
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:24,400
know in the context of undirected graphs basically the Joint Distribution for the

160
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,499
basically the Joint Distribution for the variables will be written as the product

161
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,290
variables will be written as the product of some potentials that are defined

162
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,769
of some potentials that are defined using the variables over its clique and

163
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:34,389
using the variables over its clique and we will not give you any specific

164
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:36,669
we will not give you any specific details but they are can be anything the

165
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:38,049
details but they are can be anything the only constraint actually is that they

166
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:39,970
only constraint actually is that they are positive so effectively when you

167
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,379
are positive so effectively when you multiply them you get a probability

168
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:43,329
multiply them you get a probability distribution which will not be

169
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:45,460
distribution which will not be normalized but that's the only thing I

170
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,749
normalized but that's the only thing I want you to understand so for example if

171
00:09:49,749 --> 00:09:52,179
want you to understand so for example if this is the same example with it earlier

172
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:54,999
this is the same example with it earlier but I am showing this form directly

173
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:57,609
but I am showing this form directly graphs if you want to find the joint of

174
00:09:57,609 --> 00:10:01,359
graphs if you want to find the joint of X 1 and X 6 4 X 6 is given so that's an

175
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:04,509
X 1 and X 6 4 X 6 is given so that's an evidence node what you need to do is you

176
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:08,650
evidence node what you need to do is you have to write the you know you have to

177
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,689
have to write the you know you have to popularize the joint probability of all

178
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:12,759
popularize the joint probability of all the variables and integrate everything

179
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,210
the variables and integrate everything out except X 1 and X 6 you have to

180
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,139
out except X 1 and X 6 you have to integrate X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 6 X 6 to the

181
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:23,230
integrate X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 6 X 6 to the with this evidence function to these X

182
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,829
with this evidence function to these X bar sticks and you notice we instead of

183
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:28,509
bar sticks and you notice we instead of probabilities here I have this potential

184
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:30,730
probabilities here I have this potential function this is the way we define

185
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,090
function this is the way we define undirected graphs ok and again as I said

186
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,869
undirected graphs ok and again as I said we will see this slowly in the following

187
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:40,509
we will see this slowly in the following lecture we start today but I want you to

188
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,609
lecture we start today but I want you to sleep now because I'm going to use some

189
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:45,730
sleep now because I'm going to use some ideas from undirected graphs and already

190
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,819
ideas from undirected graphs and already following the elimination algorithm so

191
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:50,679
following the elimination algorithm so the probability of conditional

192
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:53,559
the probability of conditional probabilities but the rest the

193
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,090
probabilities but the rest the operations of putting some of the

194
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,030
operations of putting some of the summations in words and in order of

195
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,789
summations in words and in order of elimination of the nodes is the same for

196
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:04,989
elimination of the nodes is the same for both sets of graphs so for example here

197
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:08,470
both sets of graphs so for example here you know let's see X 6 is fixed to this

198
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,600
you know let's see X 6 is fixed to this value

199
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,340
value okay but I believe you notice when I

200
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,830
okay but I believe you notice when I guess this Lent the function the idea is

201
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,420
guess this Lent the function the idea is going to use the render function you

202
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,970
going to use the render function you will have to sound 1x6 right so when you

203
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,800
will have to sound 1x6 right so when you sound for all possible values of X takes

204
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,070
sound for all possible values of X takes only when you hit this X bar six this

205
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,170
only when you hit this X bar six this would be nonzero so the rest is non zero

206
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,080
would be nonzero so the rest is non zero so this summation sort of gets you only

207
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,850
so this summation sort of gets you only one value corresponding to this bar

208
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,800
one value corresponding to this bar value there okay so so the summation X 6

209
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,960
value there okay so so the summation X 6 is not some of the second line I already

210
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,240
is not some of the second line I already put the evidence here and then I have to

211
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,400
put the evidence here and then I have to summon X 5 that our Explorer X 3 and X

212
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,010
summon X 5 that our Explorer X 3 and X few and you notice here I have

213
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,270
few and you notice here I have potentials that involve the nodes 3 5

214
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:52,320
potentials that involve the nodes 3 5 all right and two five and six two five

215
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,460
all right and two five and six two five and six okay and I'm going to sum in

216
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,370
and six okay and I'm going to sum in five and I call this exactly as we did

217
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,700
five and I call this exactly as we did with directed graphs real quick five

218
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,320
with directed graphs real quick five subscript and whatever notes are left

219
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,150
subscript and whatever notes are left let's hear what is left there are X 5 is

220
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,270
let's hear what is left there are X 5 is Delta X 6 X has some specific body

221
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,810
Delta X 6 X has some specific body choice of no interest is X 2 X 3 all

222
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,090
choice of no interest is X 2 X 3 all right so this doesn't involve any

223
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,650
right so this doesn't involve any expression when I do the summation and

224
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,080
expression when I do the summation and export is exactly this before I get

225
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,030
export is exactly this before I get another potential fear of explore the

226
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,310
another potential fear of explore the defense on your legs to then I have to

227
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,890
defense on your legs to then I have to solve this product in X 3 and then I

228
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,950
solve this product in X 3 and then I have to sum everything in X 2 this is

229
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,080
have to sum everything in X 2 this is the normalization factor right so when

230
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,030
the normalization factor right so when we write it like that the distribution

231
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,090
we write it like that the distribution is normalized so we have to put some

232
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,780
is normalized so we have to put some normalization factor and effectively if

233
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,940
normalization factor and effectively if you want to find the conditional write

234
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,730
you want to find the conditional write once you compute this in the condition

235
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,350
once you compute this in the condition will be proportional to that so you can

236
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,990
will be proportional to that so you can normalize by summing this potential

237
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,390
normalize by summing this potential period view over all possible values of

238
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:55,710
period view over all possible values of x1 okay so the rest even under extra

239
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,300
x1 okay so the rest even under extra class don't really have any difference

240
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,100
class don't really have any difference when it comes to the implementation of

241
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,920
when it comes to the implementation of our standard elimination algorithm but

242
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,870
our standard elimination algorithm but they will help us to do this sort of

243
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,770
they will help us to do this sort of graphically okay and and it would be

244
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,930
graphically okay and and it would be easier way not only to conserve to get

245
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,010
easier way not only to conserve to get the concept here right but also to

246
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,790
the concept here right but also to Graham this and implemented let me see

247
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:22,370
Graham this and implemented let me see if I have anything else to say here okay

248
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,950
if I have anything else to say here okay so again the only difference is not

249
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,160
so again the only difference is not conditional probabilities but potentials

250
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,980
conditional probabilities but potentials defined over maximal cliques and I told

251
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,810
defined over maximal cliques and I told you how many clicks you have here one

252
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,220
you how many clicks you have here one two three four and five clicks okay this

253
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,090
two three four and five clicks okay this is what undirected graphs it's okay so

254
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,920
is what undirected graphs it's okay so we need a graphical way that somehow

255
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,470
we need a graphical way that somehow helps us to control the complexity of

256
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,240
helps us to control the complexity of the eliminate algorithm so we need to

257
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,870
the eliminate algorithm so we need to see how we're gonna do this and I'm

258
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,990
see how we're gonna do this and I'm going to start with this I deal with a

259
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,750
going to start with this I deal with a point guard elimination which is not of

260
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,900
point guard elimination which is not of the graph analog of the elimination

261
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,450
the graph analog of the elimination algorithm we have seen but I am gonna

262
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,820
algorithm we have seen but I am gonna post this for undirected graphs for a

263
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,100
post this for undirected graphs for a reason and then I will generalize the

264
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,120
reason and then I will generalize the directed graphs

265
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,300
directed graphs okay so let's see if this is part

266
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,310


267
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:19,610
theoretical so we have an elimination or drive for graph G and the elimination

268
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,050
drive for graph G and the elimination the gutter elimination algorithm white

269
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,700
the gutter elimination algorithm white domination does the trick

270
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,650
domination does the trick it says probably no reasoning

271
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,410
it says probably no reasoning elimination rule is connect all if it's

272
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,900
elimination rule is connect all if it's very boots and then let me move excite

273
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:41,360
very boots and then let me move excite from the graph and I put this in blue

274
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,190
from the graph and I put this in blue for the purpose connect all the

275
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,410
for the purpose connect all the neighbors of X I and the neighbors of

276
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,280
neighbors of X I and the neighbors of the graph is the DEF neighbors so that's

277
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,530
the graph is the DEF neighbors so that's a grant concept it's not like you have

278
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,300
a grant concept it's not like you have ever seen you say the patterns from the

279
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,400
ever seen you say the patterns from the kids and you know just the graph damage

280
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,060
kids and you know just the graph damage okay

281
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,950
okay so you connect all the neighbors and

282
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,860
so you connect all the neighbors and then we move excite from the graph so

283
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,260
then we move excite from the graph so let's take how this thing works

284
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,380
let's take how this thing works graphically so let's say we want this is

285
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,970
graphically so let's say we want this is the elimination order we want to

286
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,610
the elimination order we want to eliminate first let's fix then X 5 X 4 X

287
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,830
eliminate first let's fix then X 5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1 so to eliminate X 6

288
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,260
3 X 2 X 1 so to eliminate X 6 what do we need to do

289
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,010
what do we need to do elimination algorithm look at the

290
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,300
elimination algorithm look at the neighbors the neighbors have two and

291
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,030
neighbors the neighbors have two and five in the water the neighborhood's

292
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,840
five in the water the neighborhood's collective then we eliminated six we get

293
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,380
collective then we eliminated six we get this then in our earth of the next node

294
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,530
this then in our earth of the next node is expired before we eliminate expired

295
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,360
is expired before we eliminate expired would look at the name versus X 2 and X

296
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,180
would look at the name versus X 2 and X 3 we connect them and then with what we

297
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,930
3 we connect them and then with what we do to X 5 eliminate then our next node

298
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,390
do to X 5 eliminate then our next node is explore the neighbor is X 2 there is

299
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,610
is explore the neighbor is X 2 there is nothing no need to put a link so we

300
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,710
nothing no need to put a link so we eliminate X 4 which is list then the

301
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,420
eliminate X 4 which is list then the next fixed X 3 like this and then X 1

302
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,140
next fixed X 3 like this and then X 1 the key thing here is the following step

303
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,970
the key thing here is the following step that somehow we connect with the

304
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,180
that somehow we connect with the neighbors all right and who else did we

305
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,480
neighbors all right and who else did we connect the neighbors so this was

306
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,140
connect the neighbors so this was eliminated and then this thing here but

307
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,500
eliminated and then this thing here but connected nodes 2 &amp; 3

308
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,840
connected nodes 2 &amp; 3 okay and again the concept of the

309
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,920
okay and again the concept of the neighbors right is is a good political

310
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,190
neighbors right is is a good political concept in the context of undirected

311
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,470
concept in the context of undirected graphs now you notice that each time a

312
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,810
graphs now you notice that each time a node is eliminated all of its neighbors

313
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,270
node is eliminated all of its neighbors are correct are connected forming a

314
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,490
are correct are connected forming a clique that's what we call the

315
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,030
clique that's what we call the elimination Creek so for example here

316
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,630
elimination Creek so for example here when I connect now student 5 2 5 &amp; 6 is

317
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,380
when I connect now student 5 2 5 &amp; 6 is a clique fully connected set of nodes

318
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:49,060
a clique fully connected set of nodes ok when I go in and connect to a 3 2 or

319
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:54,640
ok when I go in and connect to a 3 2 or 3 &amp; 5 is the click ok so that is the

320
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,380
3 &amp; 5 is the click ok so that is the elimination click and it is very

321
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,310
elimination click and it is very important you can connect this back with

322
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,560
important you can connect this back with the elimination algorithm we discussed

323
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,960
the elimination algorithm we discussed before but we will see this now in a in

324
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,780
before but we will see this now in a in a graphical reading fashion so for

325
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,189
a graphical reading fashion so for example in in

326
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:13,059
example in in you know there clicks but we generated

327
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:17,149
you know there clicks but we generated in the previous example is this click

328
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:20,989
in the previous example is this click two five and six and I could exist six

329
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:24,199
two five and six and I could exist six because it corresponds to node six right

330
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,789
because it corresponds to node six right this is the note that I'm going to

331
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:28,189
this is the note that I'm going to eliminate from this click but this is

332
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:30,789
eliminate from this click but this is the click two five and six right and

333
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:33,979
the click two five and six right and there is another click that I generated

334
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:36,409
there is another click that I generated which is two three and five and I call

335
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:38,450
which is two three and five and I call it 5c five because I'm going to

336
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,330
it 5c five because I'm going to eliminate no time okay so three powerful

337
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,399
eliminate no time okay so three powerful visiting program elimination algorithm

338
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,220
visiting program elimination algorithm is that it's time to remove a node if

339
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,690
is that it's time to remove a node if you record the collection of nodes that

340
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,729
you record the collection of nodes that are the neighbors of X I at that moment

341
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:55,639
are the neighbors of X I at that moment including excite self which are this

342
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,859
including excite self which are this maximal leaks that are formed during the

343
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:04,240
maximal leaks that are formed during the elimination algorithm okay

344
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,250


345
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:10,220
nothing because the operations you're going to do right when you are going to

346
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,380
going to do right when you are going to eliminate the note you are going to

347
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,920
eliminate the note you are going to multiply basically I'm gonna work with

348
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,590
multiply basically I'm gonna work with the potentials from districts so the

349
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,210
the potentials from districts so the biggest the size of the click the more

350
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,460
biggest the size of the click the more complex the algorithm will be and that's

351
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,400
complex the algorithm will be and that's why the largest clique but that you

352
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,640
why the largest clique but that you can't with defines the order of complex

353
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,290
can't with defines the order of complex fields the of the algorithm

354
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,780
fields the of the algorithm okay so nowadays basically the maximum

355
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,210
okay so nowadays basically the maximum size of the Greeks is 3 so that will

356
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,000
size of the Greeks is 3 so that will define the complexity of the output so

357
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,160
define the complexity of the output so let's say if it's not takes K values

358
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,330
let's say if it's not takes K values this could be gave the power 3 so case

359
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,460
this could be gave the power 3 so case what we saw in the earlier lecture is

360
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,320
what we saw in the earlier lecture is defined as the 3 width of the graph okay

361
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,510
defined as the 3 width of the graph okay okay so this is dependence masking even

362
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,370
okay so this is dependence masking even a maximum size the size of the maximum

363
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,770
a maximum size the size of the maximum clique that you get when you implement

364
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:12,250
clique that you get when you implement this graph lumination output okay

365
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:12,260


366
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:21,130
all right so so the I'm looking here on the front bullet right so it says the

367
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,750
the front bullet right so it says the elimination of the node has the effect

368
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,049
elimination of the node has the effect of creating new dependencies between all

369
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:27,789
of creating new dependencies between all pairs of neighbors thus introducing a

370
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:29,890
pairs of neighbors thus introducing a new clique in the graph so the idea here

371
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,370
new clique in the graph so the idea here is by saying connect the neighbors of X

372
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,000
is by saying connect the neighbors of X 6 somehow nodes 2 &amp; 5 become now

373
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,690
6 somehow nodes 2 &amp; 5 become now dependent and in some circumstances you

374
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,690
dependent and in some circumstances you won't be able to see it say ha there is

375
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,480
won't be able to see it say ha there is a relation of nodes 2 &amp; 5 right I'm

376
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,409
a relation of nodes 2 &amp; 5 right I'm sorry yeah

377
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:50,289
sorry yeah no it's two in five I mean they're on

378
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,030
no it's two in five I mean they're on the other side of this graph system but

379
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,830
the other side of this graph system but somehow if you're going to eliminate X

380
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,070
somehow if you're going to eliminate X this X 6 during to reduce these

381
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,520
this X 6 during to reduce these dependencies between nodes 5 and we will

382
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,860
dependencies between nodes 5 and we will say if you don't do this step when we

383
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,039
say if you don't do this step when we work with with directed graphs basically

384
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,750
work with with directed graphs basically you will not be able to model this

385
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,039
you will not be able to model this correctly ok

386
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,710
correctly ok so in this particular case you notice

387
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,960
so in this particular case you notice you for voluntary angular's right and

388
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,700
you for voluntary angular's right and that's why this process is contouring

389
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:26,260
that's why this process is contouring relation of the graph for an undirected

390
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,830
relation of the graph for an undirected graph where we connect you know the

391
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,830
graph where we connect you know the inventor of elimination we connect the

392
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,500
inventor of elimination we connect the neighbors of the node to be eliminated

393
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,630
neighbors of the node to be eliminated forming these cliques lexical list can

394
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:51,880
forming these cliques lexical list can be extended to but notice here before

395
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,760
be extended to but notice here before you say okay transformation of directed

396
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,890
you say okay transformation of directed graph and then apply the undirected

397
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,320
graph and then apply the undirected graph elimination algorithm there is an

398
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,870
graph elimination algorithm there is an intermediate step and in previous step

399
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,970
intermediate step and in previous step that's extremely important it says where

400
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,789
that's extremely important it says where is the doctor and then transform it to

401
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:10,510
is the doctor and then transform it to an undirected graph about sort of a very

402
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,250
an undirected graph about sort of a very tricky concept if you miss the step

403
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,820
tricky concept if you miss the step basically this Albert do not work so the

404
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,669
basically this Albert do not work so the idea here is not simply to transform it

405
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:21,169
idea here is not simply to transform it an undirected graph but you have to

406
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:22,970
an undirected graph but you have to moisturize it and remind me which

407
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,740
moisturize it and remind me which modernization here let's make the

408
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,169
modernization here let's make the parents basically okay so the idea here

409
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:32,720
parents basically okay so the idea here is for example we need to connect the

410
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,590
is for example we need to connect the parents let's say of 6 which is 2 &amp; 5

411
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:40,730
parents let's say of 6 which is 2 &amp; 5 and then transform this to an undirected

412
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,360
and then transform this to an undirected graph can you know the next krishna is

413
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,090
graph can you know the next krishna is basically the so pictorially why if you

414
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,250
basically the so pictorially why if you don't do this step you would be messing

415
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,870
don't do this step you would be messing things up but can anybody basically just

416
00:21:52,870 --> 00:22:07,740
things up but can anybody basically just stop thinking why that step is attention

417
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:07,750


418
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:14,190
no but we remembered in the in the in the undirected graph we also connect the

419
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,090
the undirected graph we also connect the neighbors right so somebody will say

420
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:21,930
neighbors right so somebody will say when let's say I limit X 6 2 &amp; 5 will be

421
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,340
when let's say I limit X 6 2 &amp; 5 will be neighbors I'm going to connect them so

422
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,740
neighbors I'm going to connect them so there is the modernization so I took

423
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,020
there is the modernization so I took care of it

424
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:41,910
care of it so why do I need to moralize

425
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:41,920


426
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:48,630
we're saying is it seems like in first loop but because here we collect the

427
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,970
loop but because here we collect the neighbors that maybe this does already

428
00:22:50,970 --> 00:23:04,910
neighbors that maybe this does already demonisation does it

429
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:04,920


430
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:11,150
I mean let's not go through that it to the net right that's not just imagining

431
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,090
the net right that's not just imagining things so then we can bypass many of

432
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,130
things so then we can bypass many of them of the following slides so let's

433
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:21,100
them of the following slides so let's say we make this an undirected graph

434
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,580
say we make this an undirected graph alright okay so we connect Rene but I'm

435
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,280
alright okay so we connect Rene but I'm sorry this is okay so in this case this

436
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,540
sorry this is okay so in this case this is this distant my lines okay I this

437
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,210
is this distant my lines okay I this will not work my god okay so let's see

438
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,160
will not work my god okay so let's see here's the example if any minute x6

439
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,650
here's the example if any minute x6 the way we did it before there's not

440
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:46,730
the way we did it before there's not gonna be any issue right so let me do

441
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,800
gonna be any issue right so let me do the following let me try one in

442
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,160
the following let me try one in terminating x6 because there will not be

443
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,740
terminating x6 because there will not be able to how we're different some

444
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,050
able to how we're different some organization does let's say we eliminate

445
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,260
organization does let's say we eliminate X Pfeiffer was it you go back to this

446
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,370
X Pfeiffer was it you go back to this slide and eliminate X 5 and let's say we

447
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:10,070
slide and eliminate X 5 and let's say we don't do any monetization so if you

448
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,750
don't do any monetization so if you don't deny realization and you transfer

449
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:17,030
don't deny realization and you transfer this to you know to an undirected graph

450
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,650
this to you know to an undirected graph what is the first thing you're going to

451
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,730
what is the first thing you're going to do on this guy so there's no

452
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,830
do on this guy so there's no modernization here right so if I

453
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,210
modernization here right so if I eliminate X 5 what needs to happen in

454
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:36,750
eliminate X 5 what needs to happen in the undirected graph algorithm

455
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:36,760


456
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:46,320
whether the neighbor survived

457
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,330


458
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:52,110
so we let me show you the calculation right this is the undirected graph so if

459
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,810
right this is the undirected graph so if I'm going to eliminate X 5 what we need

460
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,150
I'm going to eliminate X 5 what we need to do is we need to sum or X 5 the

461
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,520
to do is we need to sum or X 5 the following conditional distributions

462
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,820
following conditional distributions expired given X 3 all right and X 6

463
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,560
expired given X 3 all right and X 6 given X 2 X 5 we read this from the

464
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,020
given X 2 X 5 we read this from the directed graph so basically one way or

465
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,450
directed graph so basically one way or another this is the calculation that we

466
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,850
another this is the calculation that we need to do and when you look at this

467
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,690
need to do and when you look at this calculation with X 5 integrated out who

468
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,440
calculation with X 5 integrated out who now get dependencies between which node

469
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,210
now get dependencies between which node X 2 X 3 and X 6 so let me see this X 2 X

470
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:32,520
X 2 X 3 and X 6 so let me see this X 2 X 3 and X X 6 is that dependency going to

471
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,040
3 and X X 6 is that dependency going to be there when we use just the undirected

472
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,830
be there when we use just the undirected graph elimination algorithm without

473
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,500
graph elimination algorithm without realization so again we have a

474
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,940
realization so again we have a dependence between X 2 X 3 and X 6 X 2 X

475
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,770
dependence between X 2 X 3 and X 6 X 2 X 3 and X fixed

476
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:49,780


477
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:57,000
what is going to be missing when I apply they the undirected graph elimination

478
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,460
they the undirected graph elimination algorithm so I need the dependency

479
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,760
algorithm so I need the dependency between x2 x3 and x6 so if you do this

480
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,190
between x2 x3 and x6 so if you do this in the undirected graph without the

481
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,970
in the undirected graph without the modernization step and you get me the

482
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,280
modernization step and you get me the perspire first what are you going to do

483
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,100
perspire first what are you going to do in the graph what Nick is going to be

484
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:19,080
in the graph what Nick is going to be introduced you remember in the simulator

485
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,740
introduced you remember in the simulator if you need to connect the neighbors

486
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:28,110
if you need to connect the neighbors right and whether the neighbors are 5 3

487
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,600
right and whether the neighbors are 5 3 &amp; 6 so what is going to be missing from

488
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,490
&amp; 6 so what is going to be missing from the girls but somehow is not going to

489
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,840
the girls but somehow is not going to account for the dependence implied here

490
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,560
account for the dependence implied here x2 and x3 so the link between x2 x3 is

491
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,030
x2 and x3 so the link between x2 x3 is going to be missing is not going to be

492
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:50,820
going to be missing is not going to be there ok is the perfect 6 what do you do

493
00:26:50,820 --> 00:27:00,720
there ok is the perfect 6 what do you do you link X 2 and X 5 you see its

494
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,220
you link X 2 and X 5 you see its neighbors become what knows in the

495
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,620
neighbors become what knows in the undirected God now it sure you may

496
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,110
undirected God now it sure you may realize you're going to put this link

497
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,130
realize you're going to put this link from 3 to 5

498
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,500
from 3 to 5 right now that you're going to eliminate

499
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,760
right now that you're going to eliminate right there that says you need to

500
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,010
right there that says you need to connect there the neighbors and the

501
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,850
connect there the neighbors and the neighbors of 5 now going to be which 1 2

502
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,330
neighbors of 5 now going to be which 1 2 &amp; 3

503
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,320
&amp; 3 and that's how you get the link of 23

504
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,409
and that's how you get the link of 23 in other ways the motorization comes

505
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:32,570
in other ways the motorization comes from x6 right and the thing is not going

506
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,999
from x6 right and the thing is not going to be around but there but now there is

507
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:37,070
to be around but there but now there is a dependency that you need to introduce

508
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,799
a dependency that you need to introduce between x2 x3 but to see here that

509
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,659
between x2 x3 but to see here that they're going to be missing because you

510
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:46,509
they're going to be missing because you demoralize the parents of x6 okay so the

511
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:49,489
demoralize the parents of x6 okay so the sorry but if you do this and you do a

512
00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:52,159
sorry but if you do this and you do a perfect 6 look that's where I was asking

513
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,159
perfect 6 look that's where I was asking me surely obviously you're not going to

514
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:56,899
me surely obviously you're not going to have a problem with the algorithm but if

515
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:59,149
have a problem with the algorithm but if you want to eliminate expiring first

516
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:02,269
you want to eliminate expiring first that's when the problem appears so here

517
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:05,659
that's when the problem appears so here is the algorithm you are going to you

518
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:07,639
is the algorithm you are going to you need to moralize the graph and then

519
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:10,099
need to moralize the graph and then apply this on directed graph eliminate

520
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:12,560
apply this on directed graph eliminate algo so does paralyze it to us for

521
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,629
algo so does paralyze it to us for eternal directed graph and apply this

522
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:16,580
eternal directed graph and apply this algorithm that is truly best for graph

523
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:26,869
algorithm that is truly best for graph theory do anything you know this is how

524
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:28,460
theory do anything you know this is how the algorithm is working in action for

525
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,919
the algorithm is working in action for example if let's say the elimination is

526
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:35,119
example if let's say the elimination is eliminate so this was the dark lines of

527
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:37,460
eliminate so this was the dark lines of the original graph you marry this to

528
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,820
the original graph you marry this to this dotted line comes from organization

529
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:46,369
this dotted line comes from organization and this line has come where this is

530
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:48,080
and this line has come where this is because you know you married the parents

531
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,239
because you know you married the parents of X 6 and this line comes because what

532
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:54,889
of X 6 and this line comes because what when you are ready to eliminate X 5 we

533
00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:57,529
when you are ready to eliminate X 5 we need to correct its labels of their two

534
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,930
need to correct its labels of their two and three so two different origin one is

535
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,840
and three so two different origin one is the modernization the other one is is

536
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,090
the modernization the other one is is coming by connecting so long comes

537
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,090
coming by connecting so long comes basically from this part of the

538
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,789
basically from this part of the algorithm the other one comes from the

539
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:14,440
algorithm the other one comes from the undirected graph three minutes

540
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:14,450


541
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:21,520
all right the next thing is really now people really have seen it okay so I'm

542
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,680
people really have seen it okay so I'm going to stop there and then I'm going

543
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:30,480
going to stop there and then I'm going to switch lecture and I'm going to go to

544
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,810
to switch lecture and I'm going to go to punish my computer do you see a mouse on

545
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:42,750
punish my computer do you see a mouse on the screen

546
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:42,760


547
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,659
so what do I supposed to do okay let me remove this thing out first

548
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:50,070
remove this thing out first now people lost uh some of the computer

549
00:29:50,070 --> 00:30:13,250
now people lost uh some of the computer screen

550
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:13,260


551
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:19,980
all right okay so we're going to basically see how

552
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,850
okay so we're going to basically see how slowly this positive factorization that

553
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,799
slowly this positive factorization that distributions in undirected God

554
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,169
distributions in undirected God okay and actually I'm going to come back

555
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:32,600
okay and actually I'm going to come back to this topic sort of in a more rigorous

556
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,820
to this topic sort of in a more rigorous language maybe four or five lectures

557
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,919
language maybe four or five lectures okay so but right now we're going to do

558
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,419
okay so but right now we're going to do sort of an intermediate easygoing

559
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:45,080
sort of an intermediate easygoing presentation of undirected graphs and

560
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,350
presentation of undirected graphs and maybe next Thursday we'll discuss a

561
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,789
maybe next Thursday we'll discuss a little bit about what's called factor

562
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:54,840
little bit about what's called factor graphs alright so we have seen this in

563
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,100
graphs alright so we have seen this in more detail we just discussed about

564
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,690
more detail we just discussed about directed graphs another name from the

565
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,509
directed graphs another name from the raphe graphs is Markov random fields for

566
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:07,320
raphe graphs is Markov random fields for ghosts in in physics engineering etc you

567
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,129
ghosts in in physics engineering etc you know must read you be interested on this

568
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:14,700
know must read you be interested on this type of models people for example in

569
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,629
type of models people for example in social networks in in problems that

570
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:20,639
social networks in in problems that there is a causal relations they are

571
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:23,159
there is a causal relations they are interested in Bayesian networks but

572
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:26,430
interested in Bayesian networks but actually most algorithms but you know if

573
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,230
actually most algorithms but you know if you if you want to operate on this you

574
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,299
you if you want to operate on this you will transport with some other core most

575
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:34,019
will transport with some other core most probably you know an undirected graph

576
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,360
probably you know an undirected graph for the factor graph okay so it's not

577
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,519
for the factor graph okay so it's not like we're going to let them different

578
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,350
like we're going to let them different techniques for each graph but I'm just

579
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:44,210
techniques for each graph but I'm just saying this is the standard way of doing

580
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,399
saying this is the standard way of doing things to tell in in engineering you

581
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,680
things to tell in in engineering you know modeling random properties and

582
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,379
know modeling random properties and things like that this is more in when

583
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:57,360
things like that this is more in when you have causality relation okay we

584
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,799
you have causality relation okay we mentioned one example that would like to

585
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:07,970
mentioned one example that would like to come back now to it okay so basically

586
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,070
come back now to it okay so basically you know our model so we have nodes

587
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,289
you know our model so we have nodes exactly as before but there are random

588
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:16,470
exactly as before but there are random variables we have entities that describe

589
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:20,399
variables we have entities that describe basically independent relations and

590
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,130
basically independent relations and there is no

591
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:24,010
there is no symmetry but has to do with directional

592
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,560
symmetry but has to do with directional arrows so there's a sense of think that

593
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,680
arrows so there's a sense of think that you know I'm your parent here everyone

594
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,660
you know I'm your parent here everyone is the parent you know so the summation

595
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,450
is the parent you know so the summation between a and C is equivalent okay there

596
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,770
between a and C is equivalent okay there is no directionality here and it comes

597
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,650
is no directionality here and it comes up but the independence realizes this

598
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,510
up but the independence realizes this very important one of the electric

599
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,080
very important one of the electric valves

600
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,060
valves they're basically got separation you

601
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:54,490
they're basically got separation you know ideas so here is a one relation I

602
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,650
know ideas so here is a one relation I said that a and B are independent given

603
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,370
said that a and B are independent given two T and D okay so what happens is to

604
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:03,640
two T and D okay so what happens is to the conditioned on C and D and I claim

605
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,940
the conditioned on C and D and I claim that a is independent of B because every

606
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,550
that a is independent of B because every party from A to B has to pass through C

607
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,670
party from A to B has to pass through C and D so if I given C and D the path is

608
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,490
and D so if I given C and D the path is blocked in a completely graph theoretic

609
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,110
blocked in a completely graph theoretic waste in other words there is no path

610
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,150
waste in other words there is no path from A to B that doesn't pass through

611
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:23,590
from A to B that doesn't pass through see the union of C and D okay it's a

612
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,660
see the union of C and D okay it's a critical Hritik graph theoretic

613
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,530
critical Hritik graph theoretic algorithm right so we do have this

614
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:32,910
algorithm right so we do have this explain a wasting we had with the torque

615
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,160
explain a wasting we had with the torque independence that we show in directed

616
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,770
independence that we show in directed graphical models so here you know if you

617
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,860
graphical models so here you know if you apply the beta small algorithm and if

618
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,020
apply the beta small algorithm and if you have to pass through a path of knows

619
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,640
you have to pass through a path of knows that I've described basically that

620
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,730
that I've described basically that immediately defines the conditional

621
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:54,790
immediately defines the conditional independence relations for this craft a

622
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,100
independence relations for this craft a very simple calculation if you have n

623
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:04,300
very simple calculation if you have n random variables okay and let's see what

624
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,580
random variables okay and let's see what I'm doing is I'm completing all possible

625
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,440
I'm doing is I'm completing all possible ways of coming up with relationships

626
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,419
ways of coming up with relationships that shake here between three random

627
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:17,169
that shake here between three random variables okay so in this case the

628
00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:19,840
variables okay so in this case the player on the variables are fully

629
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,909
player on the variables are fully independent all right here this one

630
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:26,609
independent all right here this one connection or the connection etc and

631
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:26,619


632
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:34,460
if I have n random variables and they're binary let's take this case

633
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,289
binary let's take this case naturally not binary this two shares

634
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:39,749
naturally not binary this two shares thanks for what this is the total number

635
00:34:39,749 --> 00:34:42,389
thanks for what this is the total number of undirected graphs because here mmm

636
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:44,759
of undirected graphs because here mmm the bottom also my claim is 2 to the

637
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:47,609
the bottom also my claim is 2 to the power n n minus 1 over 2 the distance

638
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:51,509
power n n minus 1 over 2 the distance for what I mean if I have to knowledge

639
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:53,399
for what I mean if I have to knowledge there's no self connect to go they are

640
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,419
there's no self connect to go they are not connected

641
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:56,789
not connected that's what are the two cups ok so the

642
00:34:56,789 --> 00:34:59,490
that's what are the two cups ok so the total number of graphs that you can get

643
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,069
total number of graphs that you can get undirected graphs or the set of them

644
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:04,970
undirected graphs or the set of them from the variables is 2 to the power M

645
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,700
from the variables is 2 to the power M times n minus 1 over 2m is because you

646
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,420
times n minus 1 over 2m is because you have evernotes

647
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,309
have evernotes and every node can be connected with the

648
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,710
and every node can be connected with the other n minus 1 known and 2 because

649
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,660
other n minus 1 known and 2 because there is no directionality through you

650
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,579
there is no directionality through you have to you know to double count

651
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:20,990
have to you know to double count basically the number of graphs

652
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:24,150
basically the number of graphs now which God basically represents your

653
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,130
now which God basically represents your problem based on a realization of random

654
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,029
problem based on a realization of random variables

655
00:35:27,029 --> 00:35:31,529
variables what's the graph structure of the my

656
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,509
what's the graph structure of the my session problem and we will come back to

657
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:38,910
session problem and we will come back to it way later in the course from history

658
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,009
it way later in the course from history independence relations in undirected

659
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:43,130
independence relations in undirected graphs is what I described before

660
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:46,620
graphs is what I described before extremely simple there is no you don't

661
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,089
extremely simple there is no you don't need to remember the rules

662
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:50,430
need to remember the rules you know we have to share them heads and

663
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,319
you know we have to share them heads and tails or all of these things that we did

664
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:54,539
tails or all of these things that we did could directly graphs this is

665
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:59,190
could directly graphs this is independent of not given X B when every

666
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,529
independent of not given X B when every path from this set of notes the result

667
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:05,029
path from this set of notes the result of not just passed through the xB notes

668
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,609
of not just passed through the xB notes okay so basically the concept of

669
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:11,339
okay so basically the concept of conditional independence becomes a graph

670
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:13,140
conditional independence becomes a graph theoretic concept okay

671
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,079
theoretic concept okay it has nothing to do with any particular

672
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,059
it has nothing to do with any particular the Delta we have seen for directed

673
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:20,680
the Delta we have seen for directed graphs

674
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:20,690


675
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:27,400
is this a position where I wants to look at this equation and telling me you know

676
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,350
at this equation and telling me you know so basically what I say here we have two

677
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,110
so basically what I say here we have two nodes on the graph and I'm assuming that

678
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:35,590
nodes on the graph and I'm assuming that they're not connected via net so another

679
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:39,850
they're not connected via net so another going give a no J not connected is this

680
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:43,090
going give a no J not connected is this equation based on my graph support the

681
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,950
equation based on my graph support the got this condition independence

682
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:51,940
got this condition independence condition is this correct if I and J are

683
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,850
condition is this correct if I and J are not connected right every part from I to

684
00:36:54,850 --> 00:37:01,660
not connected right every part from I to J has to go through what I steer J is

685
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,520
J has to go through what I steer J is there they're not connected the only way

686
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,410
there they're not connected the only way to go is through the other node right

687
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,940
to go is through the other node right you have to go through whatever the

688
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,330
you have to go through whatever the other nodes and immediately we know if

689
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,430
other nodes and immediately we know if the other nodes are given like you we

690
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:19,180
the other nodes are given like you we condition they're then given various

691
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:26,210
condition they're then given various xixj have to be independent you see

692
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:26,220


693
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:33,950
I mean the couple we said right but this is independent that if a given XP if

694
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,630
is independent that if a given XP if every part from here to there has to

695
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,790
every part from here to there has to pass through it to be because XP would

696
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,420
pass through it to be because XP would block it so he heard if I and J don't

697
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,600
block it so he heard if I and J don't hold an edge I can claim that their

698
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,280
hold an edge I can claim that their condition independent given the rest of

699
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,500
condition independent given the rest of the nodes because the only way I can

700
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,480
the nodes because the only way I can work for my DJ is through the rest of

701
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,070
work for my DJ is through the rest of the nodes which that pop okay so the

702
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,980
the nodes which that pop okay so the addition is I am writing this as a

703
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,280
addition is I am writing this as a certified generic

704
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:01,290
certified generic

705
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:06,410
if you like it's an eric conditional independence relation but I won't desk a

706
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,870
independence relation but I won't desk a to motivate the concept that the joint

707
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,880
to motivate the concept that the joint probability distribution can be written

708
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,400
probability distribution can be written as a product or potential but each of

709
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,860
as a product or potential but each of them is declined to better click OK and

710
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:21,110
them is declined to better click OK and so this relation or pretentious defined

711
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:24,320
so this relation or pretentious defined over the clique is sort of a way to

712
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,050
over the clique is sort of a way to implicitly enforce the independence

713
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:33,710
implicitly enforce the independence relation that you see up there okay so

714
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:37,550
relation that you see up there okay so let's see what I don't know when I go on

715
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,990
let's see what I don't know when I go on this thing because we already have chin

716
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:45,520
this thing because we already have chin it okay so an example with some notes

717
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,460
it okay so an example with some notes and see what clicks we have here so the

718
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,350
and see what clicks we have here so the this of the edges of the graph so the

719
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,670
this of the edges of the graph so the only connection of the head is between

720
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,650
only connection of the head is between x1 and x4 okay

721
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:59,210
x1 and x4 okay so there are this is a click alright one

722
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:05,320
so there are this is a click alright one click X 1 X 2 X 3 is another click

723
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,910
click X 1 X 2 X 3 is another click expiry export is another Greek right and

724
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,500
expiry export is another Greek right and so the maximal cliques place take care

725
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:14,960
so the maximal cliques place take care of size of size 3 so I will write the

726
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,490
of size of size 3 so I will write the Joint Distribution we write it as

727
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,770
Joint Distribution we write it as product of potentials defined over it's

728
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,670
product of potentials defined over it's much more click OK

729
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,460
much more click OK actually what you should do right as a

730
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,260
actually what you should do right as a result of the little exercise and maybe

731
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,180
result of the little exercise and maybe sure we can give you a little homework

732
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,500
sure we can give you a little homework problem is go through this all right

733
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,170
problem is go through this all right with some simple tune-up and then

734
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,910
with some simple tune-up and then basically show the independence the

735
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,500
basically show the independence the condition independence relation that I

736
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,260
condition independence relation that I mentioned before that victim how this

737
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,000
mentioned before that victim how this knows come over maximal to X right

738
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,910
knows come over maximal to X right obviously they don't overlap and nothing

739
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,380
obviously they don't overlap and nothing flushes the refuse conditional

740
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,059
flushes the refuse conditional independence relations that we mentioned

741
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:52,390
independence relations that we mentioned before

742
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:58,329
before okay so Z's the normalization factor

743
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,710
okay so Z's the normalization factor because this potentials are not

744
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:03,460
because this potentials are not probabilities right they're just you

745
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,279
probabilities right they're just you know functions but in some sense even

746
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:09,730
know functions but in some sense even other probabilities they sort of the

747
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:13,289
other probabilities they sort of the values that they take Express how

748
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:16,599
values that they take Express how related power pairs or triplets Luce

749
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,579
related power pairs or triplets Luce variables right depending how many

750
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:20,680
variables right depending how many variables you have on this earth so they

751
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,480
variables you have on this earth so they are not probabilities but the actually

752
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,870
are not probabilities but the actually captured the way the variables are

753
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:27,700
captured the way the variables are correlated in the ground he didn't

754
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,530
correlated in the ground he didn't increase his mana

755
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,769
increase his mana [Applause]

756
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:36,190
[Applause] okay all right

757
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:40,150
okay all right so what I have done it there is the

758
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,240
so what I have done it there is the knowledge don't form a clique because WC

759
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,670
knowledge don't form a clique because WC is not connected so if I have these four

760
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,650
is not connected so if I have these four variables I can write the joint

761
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,750
variables I can write the joint probability distribution as the

762
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:55,269
probability distribution as the probability of T maximal cliques but R 1

763
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:58,960
probability of T maximal cliques but R 1 x y and z XY and Z and another one wy in

764
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,400
x y and z XY and Z and another one wy in there okay Austin all right

765
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,930
there okay Austin all right this is the composition that we see

766
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:08,319
this is the composition that we see there is not unique all right so

767
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,650
there is not unique all right so sometimes you know you you know you can

768
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,930
sometimes you know you you know you can manipulate it differently and come up

769
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:18,029
manipulate it differently and come up with some all the ways to express this

770
00:41:18,029 --> 00:41:20,319
with some all the ways to express this discrete potential so this decomposition

771
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,779
discrete potential so this decomposition doesn't have to be unique but right now

772
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:24,700
doesn't have to be unique but right now that's not an issue because at the end

773
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,789
that's not an issue because at the end of the day you're interested on

774
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:30,870
of the day you're interested on joint distribution so let's try and do

775
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:34,160
joint distribution so let's try and do one example of simple three nodes okay

776
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,519
one example of simple three nodes okay and stick this what we can represent

777
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,919
and stick this what we can represent this in terms of put themselves okay so

778
00:41:40,919 --> 00:41:42,620
this in terms of put themselves okay so one where it is I

779
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,269
one where it is I I'm gonna guess there is only enough

780
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:48,599
I'm gonna guess there is only enough separation in conditional independence

781
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,299
separation in conditional independence relation here the trace that given Y X

782
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:52,559
relation here the trace that given Y X and z are independent

783
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,339
and z are independent okay so when I try to enforce this and

784
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:59,219
okay so when I try to enforce this and see that this expression actually leads

785
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:01,859
see that this expression actually leads to decomposition of with leaks of the

786
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:04,019
to decomposition of with leaks of the Joint Distribution so what you see here

787
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:07,799
Joint Distribution so what you see here is P of x and y and z is equal to that

788
00:42:07,799 --> 00:42:09,959
is P of x and y and z is equal to that so this equation that you see in the

789
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:12,179
so this equation that you see in the middle you justify that food there's no

790
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:15,660
middle you justify that food there's no nothing assumption there but I simplify

791
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,620
nothing assumption there but I simplify and I say that P of Z given x and y is P

792
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:24,769
and I say that P of Z given x and y is P of Z given Y what can I use to do this I

793
00:42:24,769 --> 00:42:28,679
of Z given Y what can I use to do this I use the independence relation okay all

794
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,640
use the independence relation okay all right effectively what I can do is I can

795
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,949
right effectively what I can do is I can combine those things together and this

796
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:36,749
combine those things together and this becomes the joint affection of Y and

797
00:42:36,749 --> 00:42:40,049
becomes the joint affection of Y and this becomes is the condition of Z given

798
00:42:40,049 --> 00:42:42,809
this becomes is the condition of Z given Y so I can call really this my XY

799
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:45,209
Y so I can call really this my XY potential because that's one click and I

800
00:42:45,209 --> 00:42:48,239
potential because that's one click and I can call this my Y Z potential that

801
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,779
can call this my Y Z potential that comes from from this click interesting

802
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:55,019
comes from from this click interesting you know there is no way in general to

803
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:58,109
you know there is no way in general to write this initiative an example but you

804
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:00,989
write this initiative an example but you cannot write this you cannot fertilize

805
00:43:00,989 --> 00:43:03,509
cannot write this you cannot fertilize this distribution in terms of power

806
00:43:03,509 --> 00:43:05,729
this distribution in terms of power let's say conditional distributions to

807
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:08,640
let's say conditional distributions to learn or joint distribution so long it's

808
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,809
learn or joint distribution so long it's just not going to happen

809
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:13,679
just not going to happen all right so in this case you get one

810
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:15,660
all right so in this case you get one joint distribution as one potential

811
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,640
joint distribution as one potential another one a conditional as the other

812
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:24,390
another one a conditional as the other potential and you know I can I mention

813
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:28,339
potential and you know I can I mention that this decomposition is not unique

814
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:32,130
that this decomposition is not unique it's just combining the P of Y would be

815
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,919
it's just combining the P of Y would be of Z comma Y I can write this in another

816
00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:38,729
of Z comma Y I can write this in another factorization where the Y Z potential

817
00:43:38,729 --> 00:43:41,729
factorization where the Y Z potential becomes the join of y MZ and the XY

818
00:43:41,729 --> 00:43:43,799
becomes the join of y MZ and the XY potential becomes the conditional

819
00:43:43,799 --> 00:43:46,400
potential becomes the conditional effects given one so it's not unique

820
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,429
effects given one so it's not unique okay and as I said it doesn't really

821
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:52,410
okay and as I said it doesn't really matter it's not like this is better than

822
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,349
matter it's not like this is better than that you know they will do the same idea

823
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:59,429
that you know they will do the same idea and actually we will not even bother to

824
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:02,669
and actually we will not even bother to model visitors and say it is a joint or

825
00:44:02,669 --> 00:44:04,049
model visitors and say it is a joint or it's a condition no it's not some

826
00:44:04,049 --> 00:44:07,259
it's a condition no it's not some potential another potential define over

827
00:44:07,259 --> 00:44:10,769
potential another potential define over the two kliks enough to do the job all

828
00:44:10,769 --> 00:44:13,799
the two kliks enough to do the job all right so the this is the first part of

829
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:15,870
right so the this is the first part of theorem basically and has two three

830
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:19,979
theorem basically and has two three versions from the theorem coming from

831
00:44:19,979 --> 00:44:22,019
versions from the theorem coming from statistical mechanics really the

832
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:23,969
statistical mechanics really the homogeneity for theorem any distribution

833
00:44:23,969 --> 00:44:26,519
homogeneity for theorem any distribution is consistent with an undirected graph

834
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:30,169
is consistent with an undirected graph and consistent means it satisfies this

835
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:32,429
and consistent means it satisfies this condition independence relationship

836
00:44:32,429 --> 00:44:34,919
condition independence relationship supplied by the drop has the Joint

837
00:44:34,919 --> 00:44:37,289
supplied by the drop has the Joint Distribution the factorizes of the

838
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:40,880
Distribution the factorizes of the maximal cliques and looks like this okay

839
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,739
maximal cliques and looks like this okay the structures at this point are any

840
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:45,689
the structures at this point are any pass the body functions of the variables

841
00:44:45,689 --> 00:44:55,439
pass the body functions of the variables in its clip okay is two eyes I mean

842
00:44:55,439 --> 00:44:57,569
in its clip okay is two eyes I mean there's really nothing to put there but

843
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,069
there's really nothing to put there but the so fundamentally traced

844
00:44:59,069 --> 00:45:03,049
the so fundamentally traced any distribution satisfies this

845
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:05,669
any distribution satisfies this condition in the Paris relation supplied

846
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:08,069
condition in the Paris relation supplied by completely graph theoretic arguments

847
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:11,189
by completely graph theoretic arguments has to be authorized in as the product

848
00:45:11,189 --> 00:45:13,439
has to be authorized in as the product of potentials is potential the point

849
00:45:13,439 --> 00:45:17,189
of potentials is potential the point over much public okay so that's the

850
00:45:17,189 --> 00:45:21,940
over much public okay so that's the hammer strictly for theorem

851
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:21,950


852
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:28,490
all right and and I mean this is basically another version of the same

853
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,890
basically another version of the same theorem says if you learn is the common

854
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:35,720
theorem says if you learn is the common of distributions the populace is like

855
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,670
of distributions the populace is like this and if you tour is the family of

856
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,830
this and if you tour is the family of distributions or satisfies also

857
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:41,570
distributions or satisfies also conditional independence relations than

858
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:46,940
conditional independence relations than you are equal to get to okay so you sit

859
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,420
you are equal to get to okay so you sit down and you write other personal

860
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,970
down and you write other personal distributions that account for all of

861
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:55,190
distributions that account for all of independence relations applied by this

862
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,980
independence relations applied by this undirected graph and then you take all

863
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,960
undirected graph and then you take all distributions of the fertilizer in a gap

864
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,750
distributions of the fertilizer in a gap then the two things are of the strength

865
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:04,760


866
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:12,560
may be fabulous you do an example okay and tell you in which form these

867
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,760
and tell you in which form these potentials are coming is an

868
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:23,800
potentials are coming is an improvisation so consider that this have

869
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,450
improvisation so consider that this have arranged for example in in this building

870
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:30,500
arranged for example in in this building right and it's over no it's the variable

871
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,540
right and it's over no it's the variable that measures that say if the

872
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,550
that measures that say if the temperature if it is original colt all

873
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:38,050
temperature if it is original colt all right the heating system is on or off so

874
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:41,360
right the heating system is on or off so we felt that this valuable exercise here

875
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,910
we felt that this valuable exercise here is a binary plus one minus one just to

876
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:47,540
is a binary plus one minus one just to make life busy obviously this one is

877
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,670
make life busy obviously this one is called light you expect when you're

878
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:52,460
called light you expect when you're going to be called right because they

879
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,380
going to be called right because they communicate through the world so there

880
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,450
communicate through the world so there is a correlation and that correlation

881
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:59,480
is a correlation and that correlation sort of would try to capture it with the

882
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,060
sort of would try to capture it with the potential that is the kind of the click

883
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,760
potential that is the kind of the click at higher next child and I am sure if

884
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,710
at higher next child and I am sure if you know in your elementary cautious

885
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:08,660
you know in your elementary cautious when you play with this type of mobiles

886
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,300
when you play with this type of mobiles you will say I'm going to take nearest

887
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,640
you will say I'm going to take nearest neighbors for interactions you know so

888
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,210
neighbors for interactions you know so in this graph

889
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:18,500
in this graph obviously what's the size of the biggest

890
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,910
obviously what's the size of the biggest clinics from this graph the way that you

891
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:22,090
clinics from this graph the way that you state

892
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:33,610
state is it what is the size of historic store

893
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:33,620


894
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:41,380
and the reason again is not know this because remember a take is you know a

895
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:44,800
because remember a take is you know a maximal clique is every knowledge has to

896
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,050
maximal clique is every knowledge has to be interconnected it cannot be caught

897
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,700
be interconnected it cannot be caught because this node and that node are not

898
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,910
because this node and that node are not connected so what's the matter sighs is

899
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:57,880
connected so what's the matter sighs is it great it's - okay so it's do so well

900
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,950
it great it's - okay so it's do so well then I have to work here with potentials

901
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:04,240
then I have to work here with potentials but involve basically two tables that

902
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,610
but involve basically two tables that there are sort of neighbors okay the

903
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,770
there are sort of neighbors okay the joint probability distribution and I

904
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,160
joint probability distribution and I will introduce some parameters you know

905
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,200
will introduce some parameters you know is let's say whatever parameters

906
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,910
is let's say whatever parameters defining the potential are unknown in

907
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:21,430
defining the potential are unknown in general all right but I'm going to write

908
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:24,540
general all right but I'm going to write this as a product of potentials and

909
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,740
this as a product of potentials and remember the potentials need to be

910
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,540
remember the potentials need to be positive because when you put them

911
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,040
positive because when you put them together you need to give the

912
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,680
together you need to give the probability distribution and an easy way

913
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,560
probability distribution and an easy way to make them positive is to write them

914
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:41,320
to make them positive is to write them as e to some power okay this is sort of

915
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,530
as e to some power okay this is sort of a very typical of disposable type of

916
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:49,150
a very typical of disposable type of distribution so here I am writing its

917
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:52,960
distribution so here I am writing its potential as e to the PI J that connects

918
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,400
potential as e to the PI J that connects nodes X I and X J so my potential is

919
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,310
nodes X I and X J so my potential is really not the price today is to e to

920
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:03,190
really not the price today is to e to the theta equal to PI J some function

921
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,290
the theta equal to PI J some function because that way the function can be

922
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:08,140
because that way the function can be positive or negative but e to the T PI J

923
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,340
positive or negative but e to the T PI J will always be positive

924
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,850
will always be positive I'm just very formulating basically so I

925
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,110
I'm just very formulating basically so I don't have to worry about something

926
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:19,330
don't have to worry about something being negative okay another advantage is

927
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,430
being negative okay another advantage is if you write this as product of this

928
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,010
if you write this as product of this exponential function when you might have

929
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:26,470
exponential function when you might have to put them together you know based on

930
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,720
to put them together you know based on that here we discussed before if you're

931
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,450
that here we discussed before if you're going to get e to the sum of the theta J

932
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:33,280
going to get e to the sum of the theta J is defined over all the edges of the

933
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,670
is defined over all the edges of the graph

934
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:35,680


935
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:42,450
okay all right and this is a normalization factor which means this

936
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:44,820
normalization factor which means this into the summation of this you're going

937
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,590
into the summation of this you're going to have to sample all possible values of

938
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:51,090
to have to sample all possible values of x our next area all right and after this

939
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:54,720
x our next area all right and after this and hopefully you may have to do it by

940
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,660
and hopefully you may have to do it by market show because this step is where

941
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,060
market show because this step is where all the physics is coming so if you want

942
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:04,160
all the physics is coming so if you want to do statistical mechanics or compute

943
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,450
to do statistical mechanics or compute interesting properties you mean

944
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:07,830
interesting properties you mean everything has to go through this

945
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:10,590
everything has to go through this normalization factor but sort of

946
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:15,090
normalization factor but sort of responds well to free energy for the

947
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:16,920
responds well to free energy for the system okay and you notice it's

948
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,550
system okay and you notice it's complicated because estimation of the

949
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:23,490
complicated because estimation of the estimation alright so how exactly do

950
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:31,620
estimation alright so how exactly do this is to be seen all right so this is

951
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:36,410
this is to be seen all right so this is a bunch maleic distribution okay and

952
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:42,570
a bunch maleic distribution okay and there's nothing here

953
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:42,580


954
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:51,920
now sir the previous example we started with the dolphin will bounty the

955
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,760
with the dolphin will bounty the authorization of the distribution over

956
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,880
authorization of the distribution over the ground now suppose we go all the way

957
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,940
the ground now suppose we go all the way around and somebody gives you a

958
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,460
around and somebody gives you a factorization defining over the sets of

959
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,150
factorization defining over the sets of know how do you specify an undirected

960
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,490
know how do you specify an undirected graph basically that the based work

961
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:11,760
graph basically that the based work authorization the other problem is so

962
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,550
authorization the other problem is so they might but be effects is some

963
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:17,460
they might but be effects is some function of X 1 X 2 X 5 times the

964
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:21,420
function of X 1 X 2 X 5 times the function of X 4 X 3 and X 25 how do you

965
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:27,060
function of X 4 X 3 and X 25 how do you make it go well the idea is very simple

966
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,390
make it go well the idea is very simple right this they have to be now is

967
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:33,150
right this they have to be now is corresponding to maximal cliques so what

968
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,130
corresponding to maximal cliques so what you need to do is you need to take all

969
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,170
you need to do is you need to take all the nodes to find Cyrus pretentious and

970
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:38,790
the nodes to find Cyrus pretentious and collector and when you're finished

971
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:42,650
collector and when you're finished that's basically your undirected graph

972
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:45,120
that's basically your undirected graph ok there is no other way around because

973
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,740
ok there is no other way around because that's the only way that will allow you

974
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,380
that's the only way that will allow you to have a factorization that basically

975
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:54,860
to have a factorization that basically looks in this ball

976
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:54,870


977
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:58,930
all right

978
00:51:58,930 --> 00:51:58,940


979
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:05,079
so the this comes to be because because just to do with the independent

980
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:08,079
just to do with the independent relations but I didn't have to tell you

981
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,940
relations but I didn't have to tell you much about the biggest well Algar it

982
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,730
much about the biggest well Algar it right because if you want to share that

983
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,520
right because if you want to share that X 1 and X is to depend of X 5 given X 2

984
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,710
X 1 and X is to depend of X 5 given X 2 and and explore the only thing you have

985
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:22,000
and and explore the only thing you have to do is take a path from 1 to 5 and it

986
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,420
to do is take a path from 1 to 5 and it has to go through 2 &amp; 4 then the path is

987
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:25,809
has to go through 2 &amp; 4 then the path is blocked

988
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,329
blocked alright so you can use purely basically

989
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:30,760
alright so you can use purely basically reachability conditions if you can use

990
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:35,049
reachability conditions if you can use its with a set of nodes the one set of

991
00:52:35,049 --> 00:52:38,470
its with a set of nodes the one set of nodes and other set by bypassing the

992
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:42,130
nodes and other set by bypassing the evidence then basically the condition

993
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,849
evidence then basically the condition independence relation will not be born

994
00:52:44,849 --> 00:52:53,720
independence relation will not be born okay

995
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:53,730


996
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:58,340
so what's the name of this prevention table plate so you know because we have

997
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:01,250
table plate so you know because we have their condition distributions now you

998
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:05,060
their condition distributions now you know if I write this is the same example

999
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,160
know if I write this is the same example that we had before if I write this in

1000
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,320
that we had before if I write this in terms of potentials these potentials of

1001
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,960
terms of potentials these potentials of two nodes two variables two variables

1002
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,090
two nodes two variables two variables two then three this are not

1003
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:19,000
two then three this are not probabilities okay and they express

1004
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,020
probabilities okay and they express correlations between variables so

1005
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,510
correlations between variables so example you see the anthem let's like

1006
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:26,060
example you see the anthem let's like this are discrete variables can you see

1007
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,620
this are discrete variables can you see an element there that is very small

1008
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,600
an element there that is very small means the particular set of variables

1009
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,640
means the particular set of variables are not correlated with each other but

1010
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,880
are not correlated with each other but many P potentially it's something

1011
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,590
many P potentially it's something computationally we need to worry because

1012
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:40,670
computationally we need to worry because this factors are not normalized you may

1013
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:42,710
this factors are not normalized you may have a problem when you do computation

1014
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:44,360
have a problem when you do computation and influence that share parameters

1015
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:50,510
and influence that share parameters because maybe this potential here is way

1016
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:52,250
because maybe this potential here is way at much higher values than that

1017
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,950
at much higher values than that potential there that doesn't imply that

1018
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:57,200
potential there that doesn't imply that the value were sexual X still basically

1019
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,020
the value were sexual X still basically dominate the distribution simply this

1020
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,000
dominate the distribution simply this happens because you have a normalize it

1021
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,790
happens because you have a normalize it so you need to be careful when you do

1022
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:07,550
so you need to be careful when you do inference because this terms may be

1023
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:09,790
inference because this terms may be completely honest in the calculation

1024
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:13,250
completely honest in the calculation because they are not probabilities okay

1025
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,470
because they are not probabilities okay in some sense this can be a problem you

1026
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:18,770
in some sense this can be a problem you know depending what the task is from all

1027
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:20,510
know depending what the task is from all locations you may want to take advantage

1028
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:25,360
locations you may want to take advantage of that

1029
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:25,370


1030
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:35,000
all right so the the most famous problem that fits in this concept of undirected

1031
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,920
that fits in this concept of undirected graphical models is the Ising model for

1032
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,960
graphical models is the Ising model for those who have taking elementary courses

1033
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,290
those who have taking elementary courses in physics this is University model

1034
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:47,270
in physics this is University model where the matter was raised she got a

1035
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:50,810
where the matter was raised she got a plus minus 1 so this your typical run

1036
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:53,870
plus minus 1 so this your typical run with this problem but actually as

1037
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:56,570
with this problem but actually as trivial as this problem looks like right

1038
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:58,400
trivial as this problem looks like right is also one of the most difficult

1039
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,920
is also one of the most difficult problems to do especially in two and

1040
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,620
problems to do especially in two and three dimensions anybody that thinks

1041
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:06,850
three dimensions anybody that thinks this chapter a problem you know the I

1042
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:09,080
this chapter a problem you know the I textbooks basically written of hundreds

1043
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,540
textbooks basically written of hundreds of pages that are discuss about this

1044
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,430
of pages that are discuss about this problem and it is

1045
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:17,530
problem and it is Shanta file a good test case for

1046
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:20,270
Shanta file a good test case for checking relationship actually they wore

1047
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:21,020
checking relationship actually they wore okay

1048
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,960
okay and so let's discuss it because she has

1049
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,230
and so let's discuss it because she has to do a lot with statistical mechanics

1050
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:30,530
to do a lot with statistical mechanics this is in one big experiment can be

1051
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:34,340
this is in one big experiment can be plus minus one and when you need to

1052
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,320
plus minus one and when you need to capture of the Ising model is you need

1053
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,320
capture of the Ising model is you need to capture sort of correlations between

1054
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,800
to capture sort of correlations between neighbors so if this is plus one you

1055
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,170
neighbors so if this is plus one you know in thesis you say spin up for

1056
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:48,590
know in thesis you say spin up for example in quantum mechanics so if this

1057
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,020
example in quantum mechanics so if this is plus one then the neighbors tend to

1058
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:54,320
is plus one then the neighbors tend to be plus one so the corresponding body is

1059
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,990
be plus one so the corresponding body is that of the potential forgetting at

1060
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,240
that of the potential forgetting at least plus one the sky of chance of

1061
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,430
least plus one the sky of chance of getting this plus one in higher transfer

1062
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:03,230
getting this plus one in higher transfer yelling this plus one and this table

1063
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,750
yelling this plus one and this table step also look to represent that not in

1064
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,700
step also look to represent that not in the context of probabilities but

1065
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:13,430
the context of probabilities but certainly in the context you know you

1066
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:16,340
certainly in the context you know you know in the context of

1067
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:16,350


1068
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:21,210
you know the potential so you can see here for example if this is minus one

1069
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:24,780
here for example if this is minus one the probability of xn minus 1 B minus 1

1070
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,180
the probability of xn minus 1 B minus 1 I mean so the probability is no divide

1071
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,490
I mean so the probability is no divide of the prevention is much higher than

1072
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,560
of the prevention is much higher than the probability of done the value of

1073
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,720
the probability of done the value of excitements ought to be point two okay

1074
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,300
excitements ought to be point two okay again I have to correct myself there's a

1075
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,250
again I have to correct myself there's a lot probabilities then you notice they

1076
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,440
lot probabilities then you notice they don't sum up basically in any direction

1077
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:46,500
don't sum up basically in any direction you see them if you want so if you write

1078
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:50,010
you see them if you want so if you write this joint distribution as the product

1079
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:53,880
this joint distribution as the product of potential functions of the form e to

1080
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,560
of potential functions of the form e to the minus Tate ok this product will lead

1081
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,990
the minus Tate ok this product will lead to estimation of the potential and this

1082
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,760
to estimation of the potential and this is basically your Hamiltonian for the

1083
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,260
is basically your Hamiltonian for the system this is the energy of the system

1084
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,800
system this is the energy of the system which is the summation of the energy

1085
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,550
which is the summation of the energy storage click so in lots of problems in

1086
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:15,300
storage click so in lots of problems in in in undirected graphical models not

1087
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,460
in in undirected graphical models not just in the Ising model but all of them

1088
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,650
just in the Ising model but all of them actually starting with potentials you

1089
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:22,050
actually starting with potentials you know what to start this with an energy

1090
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:24,840
know what to start this with an energy function and then e to the minus knob

1091
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,510
function and then e to the minus knob basically will give you the potential

1092
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,740
basically will give you the potential all right so much times you will see

1093
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:32,040
all right so much times you will see people pasta mating directly the energy

1094
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,610
people pasta mating directly the energy over clicked all right and the

1095
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:37,080
over clicked all right and the corresponding distribution would be a

1096
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,370
corresponding distribution would be a Boltzmann distribution reduce

1097
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:42,960
Boltzmann distribution reduce distribution e to the minus 8 okay and

1098
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,060
distribution e to the minus 8 okay and if you want to make it party you can

1099
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:48,690
if you want to make it party you can introduce temperature effects of things

1100
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:54,120
introduce temperature effects of things like that but of no interest right now

1101
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:54,130


1102
00:57:54,130 --> 00:58:01,200
okay so this discuss was the Boltzmann distribution all right

1103
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,259
distribution all right what's the matter fluently remind me

1104
00:58:04,259 --> 00:58:08,940
what's the matter fluently remind me what a Markov blanket in general for a

1105
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,979
what a Markov blanket in general for a dialectic lab for example what was the

1106
00:58:10,979 --> 00:58:16,859
dialectic lab for example what was the definition

1107
00:58:16,859 --> 00:58:16,869


1108
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:25,099
so it was the parents and the comparison the idea was given the market basically

1109
00:58:25,099 --> 00:58:27,479
the idea was given the market basically the notes independent of anything else

1110
00:58:27,479 --> 00:58:32,370
the notes independent of anything else in the graph alright so in in undirected

1111
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:35,249
in the graph alright so in in undirected graphs if you want to think what the

1112
00:58:35,249 --> 00:58:37,019
graphs if you want to think what the Markov blanket is it is extremely

1113
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:39,420
Markov blanket is it is extremely trivial because the Markov blanket is

1114
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:44,039
trivial because the Markov blanket is really the neighbors of the node because

1115
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:47,999
really the neighbors of the node because if you given the neighbors there's no

1116
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:49,859
if you given the neighbors there's no way to go anywhere else because all

1117
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,589
way to go anywhere else because all paths will be blocked okay so the Markov

1118
00:58:52,589 --> 00:58:57,120
paths will be blocked okay so the Markov blanket for an undirected graph is the

1119
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:03,410
blanket for an undirected graph is the the neighbors of the nodes

1120
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:03,420


1121
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:11,450
okay

1122
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:11,460


1123
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:17,390
so you know when we were discussing about the record graphs we post some

1124
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:20,210
about the record graphs we post some sort of trivial inference problem so if

1125
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:22,370
sort of trivial inference problem so if you want for example so you have a

1126
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:24,980
you want for example so you have a matching notes here by the tray this is

1127
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:28,220
matching notes here by the tray this is the problem with X being hot or cold you

1128
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,680
the problem with X being hot or cold you know different rooms and of course and

1129
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,740
know different rooms and of course and these are the temperatures in in its

1130
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,809
these are the temperatures in in its room if you want to find given some

1131
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:38,240
room if you want to find given some evidence you won't find this conditional

1132
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,280
evidence you won't find this conditional distribution where the rest of the

1133
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,130
distribution where the rest of the volume of sixes are eliminated basically

1134
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:47,630
volume of sixes are eliminated basically what you need to do is this you can

1135
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:50,030
what you need to do is this you can write the numerator like that and the

1136
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:52,880
write the numerator like that and the denominator of this thing stuff over a

1137
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,309
denominator of this thing stuff over a possible bunch of XJ but in this case

1138
00:59:55,309 --> 00:59:58,250
possible bunch of XJ but in this case take values minus 1 and 1 and the way

1139
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:00,950
take values minus 1 and 1 and the way you handle evidence is sort of identical

1140
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:03,079
you handle evidence is sort of identical with a way you handle evident in the

1141
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:07,099
with a way you handle evident in the directed graph so you can you know so on

1142
01:00:07,099 --> 01:00:08,809
directed graph so you can you know so on the denominator here you have the joint

1143
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:12,190
the denominator here you have the joint of XJ with the evidence of type J

1144
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:15,380
of XJ with the evidence of type J successively if this expression is

1145
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,690
successively if this expression is written correctly this is the summation

1146
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:22,280
written correctly this is the summation of over X bar the most accept XK but now

1147
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,960
of over X bar the most accept XK but now this usually multiplied by the Joint

1148
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,940
this usually multiplied by the Joint Distribution with the evidence functions

1149
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:28,220
Distribution with the evidence functions to cross the bottom of society next day

1150
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,700
to cross the bottom of society next day to take this fat body

1151
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:34,940
to take this fat body okay so there's nothing again different

1152
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,890
okay so there's nothing again different from before the only difference is that

1153
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:39,200
from before the only difference is that this wrist briefly in terms of this

1154
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:44,079
this wrist briefly in terms of this potentials 11 conditional distribution

1155
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,349
potentials 11 conditional distribution so the algebra is basically sort of

1156
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:50,500
so the algebra is basically sort of identical

1157
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:50,510


1158
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:57,670
all right how do we cannot stop now you know we did lots of things about

1159
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,590
you know we did lots of things about directed graphs if you don't want to

1160
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,750
directed graphs if you don't want to work with directed graphs how do you

1161
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:07,360
work with directed graphs how do you respond to undirected graphs so let's

1162
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:11,770
respond to undirected graphs so let's look at the let's look at the joint

1163
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:14,770
look at the let's look at the joint probability distribution so x1 x2 x3

1164
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:17,590
probability distribution so x1 x2 x3 have no product next right history part

1165
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,050
have no product next right history part so we get something I got alright so

1166
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:24,190
so we get something I got alright so that is based on on this and thinking

1167
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:25,720
that is based on on this and thinking what the undirected graph is going to

1168
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,300
what the undirected graph is going to look like what is the maximum clique

1169
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,010
look like what is the maximum clique that I need to have in the problem to

1170
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:32,280
that I need to have in the problem to represent correctly that the

1171
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,580
represent correctly that the characterization what should i what is

1172
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,260
characterization what should i what is the maximum click on it you have to

1173
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:44,480
the maximum click on it you have to represent it

1174
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:44,490


1175
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:52,960
but this has X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4

1176
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:52,970


1177
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:57,069
right because export depends on X products to explain so like a return

1178
01:01:57,069 --> 01:02:00,420
products to explain so like a return here that involves basically variables

1179
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,950
here that involves basically variables so what is the maximum clique that I

1180
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:06,220
so what is the maximum clique that I expect to send the equivalent undirected

1181
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:10,960
expect to send the equivalent undirected graph for but how can you get four from

1182
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,390
graph for but how can you get four from this graph the only you can way you can

1183
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:21,010
this graph the only you can way you can get Cortez moralization all right so

1184
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:22,870
get Cortez moralization all right so basically you have to marry this balance

1185
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:24,400
basically you have to marry this balance you have to marry response they have to

1186
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,559
you have to marry response they have to marry this product and this basically

1187
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,589
marry this product and this basically will give you a clique that is the

1188
01:02:29,589 --> 01:02:31,990
will give you a clique that is the maximum clique that reporter for so

1189
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:35,020
maximum clique that reporter for so actually in this particular case right I

1190
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:37,599
actually in this particular case right I can write this is only one potential

1191
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,430
can write this is only one potential because really there's only one maximum

1192
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:41,890
because really there's only one maximum clique that involves four four notes I

1193
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:44,800
clique that involves four four notes I can write business try one of X 1 X 2 X

1194
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:48,130
can write business try one of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 okay

1195
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:51,220
3 X 4 okay the including strength if you try to

1196
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:54,940
the including strength if you try to write the total prob in with more of the

1197
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:59,050
write the total prob in with more of the terms it's mention right so you will get

1198
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:01,480
terms it's mention right so you will get some results but in reality you will

1199
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:05,650
some results but in reality you will never be able to exactly model a

1200
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:08,589
never be able to exactly model a distribution of a crisis this way the

1201
01:03:08,589 --> 01:03:10,900
distribution of a crisis this way the only way you can do this is by having a

1202
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:13,270
only way you can do this is by having a maximal clique that has all four nodes

1203
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:15,760
maximal clique that has all four nodes and this much motley can only be of they

1204
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,490
and this much motley can only be of they if you moralized the dialectic block

1205
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:23,740
if you moralized the dialectic block okay I think I'm going to go back to

1206
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:27,460
okay I think I'm going to go back to show you some cases of directed graphs

1207
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,859
show you some cases of directed graphs but there is no way you can come up with

1208
01:03:29,859 --> 01:03:33,190
but there is no way you can come up with an equivalent undirected graph but right

1209
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:35,500
an equivalent undirected graph but right now for this problem you just paralyze

1210
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:41,079
now for this problem you just paralyze the parent and Verity okay so so here's

1211
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:44,079
the parent and Verity okay so so here's another example if you have this

1212
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:46,749
another example if you have this directed graph

1213
01:03:46,749 --> 01:03:46,759


1214
01:03:46,759 --> 01:03:53,029
PF next one has the balance the effects the given x1 x 4p f x3 has no parent and

1215
01:03:53,029 --> 01:04:00,109
the given x1 x 4p f x3 has no parent and then explore given x2 and x3 okay so so

1216
01:04:00,109 --> 01:04:02,719
then explore given x2 and x3 okay so so you notice here you have my numbers 2 3

1217
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:03,319
you notice here you have my numbers 2 3 &amp; 4

1218
01:04:03,319 --> 01:04:13,370
and obviously to get 2 3 &amp; 4 you have to moralize you have to marry the parents 2

1219
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:16,459
moralize you have to marry the parents 2 &amp; 3 and this is the line here potential

1220
01:04:16,459 --> 01:04:18,469
&amp; 3 and this is the line here potential notice because if I say I'm going to

1221
01:04:18,469 --> 01:04:19,909
notice because if I say I'm going to have a potential 2 3 &amp; 4

1222
01:04:19,909 --> 01:04:22,359
have a potential 2 3 &amp; 4 in that potential I can take actually

1223
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,309
in that potential I can take actually this probability of Experion make it

1224
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:28,879
this probability of Experion make it popular prevent itself alright so if you

1225
01:04:28,879 --> 01:04:30,889
popular prevent itself alright so if you want to go from the left to the right I

1226
01:04:30,889 --> 01:04:32,959
want to go from the left to the right I can combine P of X 3 with the

1227
01:04:32,959 --> 01:04:35,899
can combine P of X 3 with the probability of X 4 X 2 8 3 and define

1228
01:04:35,899 --> 01:04:39,649
probability of X 4 X 2 8 3 and define this potential and again because X 1 and

1229
01:04:39,649 --> 01:04:42,019
this potential and again because X 1 and X 2 is a clique of two nodes I can put

1230
01:04:42,019 --> 01:04:43,639
X 2 is a clique of two nodes I can put these things together as another

1231
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:47,929
these things together as another potential so I want to of X 1 and X 2 so

1232
01:04:47,929 --> 01:04:51,379
potential so I want to of X 1 and X 2 so again you have potential to note and

1233
01:04:51,379 --> 01:04:54,819
again you have potential to note and another potential with three nodes and

1234
01:04:54,819 --> 01:04:57,889
another potential with three nodes and this problem before now belongs to non

1235
01:04:57,889 --> 01:05:07,700
this problem before now belongs to non potential and another is that any issue

1236
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:07,710


1237
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:14,390
I mean obviously you expect I mean if you think if this clicks are coming from

1238
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:15,799
you think if this clicks are coming from the wave behind were supported late and

1239
01:05:15,799 --> 01:05:17,780
the wave behind were supported late and we take a bunch of them here and the

1240
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:18,859
we take a bunch of them here and the boss of them

1241
01:05:18,859 --> 01:05:20,809
boss of them neighbors obviously they're going to be

1242
01:05:20,809 --> 01:05:23,630
neighbors obviously they're going to be staring some know if they don't say

1243
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:27,500
staring some know if they don't say basically there is no point of doing a

1244
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,910
basically there is no point of doing a methodology because the problem becomes

1245
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:31,069
methodology because the problem becomes trivial so the fact that there is no

1246
01:05:31,069 --> 01:05:33,799
trivial so the fact that there is no trick here is not an issue you know this

1247
01:05:33,799 --> 01:05:40,099
trick here is not an issue you know this is typical in this sort of problems so

1248
01:05:40,099 --> 01:05:45,380
is typical in this sort of problems so let's look actually again for converting

1249
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:47,690
let's look actually again for converting a directly to an undirected graph so

1250
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:51,170
a directly to an undirected graph so what I have seven nodes this is the

1251
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:53,240
what I have seven nodes this is the factorization for the directed graph and

1252
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,819
factorization for the directed graph and what I have done is this conditional

1253
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:57,980
what I have done is this conditional distributions I have written down as a

1254
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:02,049
distributions I have written down as a product of joint distributions divided

1255
01:06:02,049 --> 01:06:07,880
product of joint distributions divided by marginals and if you look carefully

1256
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,890
by marginals and if you look carefully of this expressions you will see that on

1257
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:14,960
of this expressions you will see that on the numerator I have products of all

1258
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,059
the numerator I have products of all right divide each of the progress of

1259
01:06:17,059 --> 01:06:22,640
right divide each of the progress of click intersections you see here there

1260
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,920
click intersections you see here there is x1 x3 all right

1261
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:33,349
is x1 x3 all right extract 3 so this play is basically the

1262
01:06:33,349 --> 01:06:35,420
extract 3 so this play is basically the intersection of the two clicks of course

1263
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,370
intersection of the two clicks of course tallest tree in quadrants another

1264
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:41,000
tallest tree in quadrants another intersection there and similarly for the

1265
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,280
intersection there and similarly for the clicks 4 5 4 6 4 7

1266
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,900
clicks 4 5 4 6 4 7 right you have these intersections later

1267
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:49,460
right you have these intersections later when we develop everybody's basically

1268
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:52,849
when we develop everybody's basically for influence on general graphs we will

1269
01:06:52,849 --> 01:06:55,069
for influence on general graphs we will try to take advantage on how these

1270
01:06:55,069 --> 01:06:57,620
try to take advantage on how these cliques communicate with each other so

1271
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:01,820
cliques communicate with each other so this is sort of this idea will be

1272
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:10,910
this is sort of this idea will be extended all right so this the trivial

1273
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:14,150
extended all right so this the trivial example I don't think it's a Markov

1274
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:19,190
example I don't think it's a Markov chain basically so you know again I

1275
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:21,770
chain basically so you know again I combine this to on potential and each of

1276
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,360
combine this to on potential and each of the other conditional distributions two

1277
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,640
the other conditional distributions two other potentials occasional nothing

1278
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:29,300
other potentials occasional nothing fancy so here you can remove all the

1279
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:31,760
fancy so here you can remove all the arrows and make basically this graph to

1280
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,730
arrows and make basically this graph to have the same identical independence

1281
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:36,410
have the same identical independence relations as to direct graph that you

1282
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:46,910
relations as to direct graph that you see on the top so what I have here is I

1283
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:49,820
see on the top so what I have here is I have another direct III and direct III

1284
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:54,020
have another direct III and direct III and the pol III okay and so can you

1285
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:55,370
and the pol III okay and so can you remind me what's the definition of an

1286
01:07:55,370 --> 01:08:01,280
remind me what's the definition of an undirected three obviously some directed

1287
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:06,520
undirected three obviously some directed what makes an undirected graph a three

1288
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:06,530


1289
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:11,450
it says the average a single path between any pair of nodes the way from

1290
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:13,340
between any pair of nodes the way from here to there this is the only path to

1291
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,620
here to there this is the only path to go from here to there there's only one

1292
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:22,390
go from here to there there's only one path okay which is two three

1293
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:22,400


1294
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:29,420
so in audacity there is a red node let's say this knob here and every other

1295
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:32,960
say this knob here and every other noxious how many parts only Ron

1296
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,930
noxious how many parts only Ron so what's the relation of a directed

1297
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:37,579
so what's the relation of a directed three you think around the elected three

1298
01:08:37,579 --> 01:08:43,579
three you think around the elected three you remember that - because home right a

1299
01:08:43,579 --> 01:08:47,059
you remember that - because home right a directive 3 - on directory we have to do

1300
01:08:47,059 --> 01:08:51,640
directive 3 - on directory we have to do first what process ionization so

1301
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,750
first what process ionization so intensified demonization in the

1302
01:08:53,750 --> 01:09:02,660
intensified demonization in the directory nothing happened

1303
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:05,750
directory nothing happened ok so basically because there's no

1304
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:09,970
ok so basically because there's no mobilization has happened but in 3 a

1305
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:15,680
mobilization has happened but in 3 a purity is like a directory but nodes can

1306
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,380
purity is like a directory but nodes can have more than one power so what will

1307
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:20,599
have more than one power so what will happen when I transform a 23 to an

1308
01:09:20,599 --> 01:09:27,180
happen when I transform a 23 to an undirected 3

1309
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:27,190


1310
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:32,490
so for example to make this around I left it well if I can make it this

1311
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:34,560
left it well if I can make it this another mr. Pony three rights if I

1312
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,860
another mr. Pony three rights if I wanted to make it an undirected graph

1313
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:41,910
wanted to make it an undirected graph what is gonna happen here you will

1314
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:43,740
what is gonna happen here you will connect the parents and if you connect

1315
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:45,720
connect the parents and if you connect the power is what is going to happen is

1316
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:50,910
the power is what is going to happen is that becoming a is not a tree no sir you

1317
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:53,480
that becoming a is not a tree no sir you know that to be public because

1318
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,830
know that to be public because influences we will see in twist is very

1319
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:57,300
influences we will see in twist is very easy all right

1320
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:00,690
easy all right we spend on lecture two so if you if the

1321
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:04,080
we spend on lecture two so if you if the problem is a directed three PC you can

1322
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,120
problem is a directed three PC you can transform it to a non directed tree and

1323
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:09,440
transform it to a non directed tree and do everything extremely particularly

1324
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,680
do everything extremely particularly disappointed tree if you can because you

1325
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,840
disappointed tree if you can because you wanna lies you get loops a lot is a

1326
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,150
wanna lies you get loops a lot is a problem and there is a way to get a

1327
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:20,580
problem and there is a way to get a harvest if you actually transform the

1328
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:24,750
harvest if you actually transform the poetry not to an undirected graph but

1329
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:27,180
poetry not to an undirected graph but this dr. graph which is another type of

1330
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:30,840
this dr. graph which is another type of graph that you know if we have a few

1331
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,580
graph that you know if we have a few minutes I'm going to show you how it

1332
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:35,630
minutes I'm going to show you how it looks like okay

1333
01:10:35,630 --> 01:11:07,570
looks like okay [Applause]

1334
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:07,580


1335
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:13,490
the reason you want to make direct loft you don't have to say okay let me select

1336
01:11:13,490 --> 01:11:15,380
you don't have to say okay let me select this to be there with no and start

1337
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:17,870
this to be there with no and start pointing arrows away from there you know

1338
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:20,090
pointing arrows away from there you know so we go this way and this this way and

1339
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:22,850
so we go this way and this this way and then that way in that way but you can

1340
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:25,160
then that way in that way but you can start reading note so you can produce

1341
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:28,730
start reading note so you can produce actually and directed graphs but they're

1342
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:32,780
actually and directed graphs but they're not necessarily equivalent okay I do see

1343
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:35,840
not necessarily equivalent okay I do see no reason why anybody will be interested

1344
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,030
no reason why anybody will be interested to transform an undirected graph to a

1345
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:41,720
to transform an undirected graph to a directed graph alright unless of course

1346
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,460
directed graph alright unless of course you are trying to learn the causal

1347
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:47,270
you are trying to learn the causal relationship model and given data there

1348
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:49,490
relationship model and given data there I can see a region in that case the

1349
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:51,080
I can see a region in that case the problem will become a golf selection

1350
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,540
problem will become a golf selection problem because you'll be asking which

1351
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:56,030
problem because you'll be asking which of these graphs better represents the

1352
01:11:56,030 --> 01:11:58,010
of these graphs better represents the data that I collected and that's an

1353
01:11:58,010 --> 01:12:03,629
data that I collected and that's an interesting problem all right

1354
01:12:03,629 --> 01:12:03,639


1355
01:12:03,639 --> 01:12:10,500
okay so let me three minutes let me do a very simple for the problem every

1356
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,680
very simple for the problem every textbook in machine lambda graphical

1357
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:17,820
textbook in machine lambda graphical varnish has this problem and this is a

1358
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:22,490
varnish has this problem and this is a problem related to image the noising so

1359
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:27,600
problem related to image the noising so you can think exile presenting pixel

1360
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,430
you can think exile presenting pixel values so that can be black or white

1361
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:31,740
values so that can be black or white let's say bye honey

1362
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:36,300
let's say bye honey okay and of any mods and why I are what

1363
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,459
okay and of any mods and why I are what you measured which are noisy versions of

1364
01:12:38,459 --> 01:12:42,660
you measured which are noisy versions of Exile right so you have an English but

1365
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,790
Exile right so you have an English but you only have some noisy version of it

1366
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:49,439
you only have some noisy version of it that is represented by Y okay obviously

1367
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:50,310
that is represented by Y okay obviously you know if you have an image

1368
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:53,070
you know if you have an image if exercise we expect the neighbors to

1369
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:55,979
if exercise we expect the neighbors to be black right so the clicks of the

1370
01:12:55,979 --> 01:12:57,120
be black right so the clicks of the Express sort of this sort of

1371
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,189
Express sort of this sort of correlations would be the click that you

1372
01:12:59,189 --> 01:13:00,930
correlations would be the click that you see here okay

1373
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:06,450
see here okay and obviously X Y and y I are correlated

1374
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:10,530
and obviously X Y and y I are correlated because I envision what I to be a noisy

1375
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:13,200
because I envision what I to be a noisy version of X are so if you want to add

1376
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,859
version of X are so if you want to add the Joint Distribution of X I X &amp; Y or

1377
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:18,959
the Joint Distribution of X I X &amp; Y or form the X pictures and why pictures

1378
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:20,970
form the X pictures and why pictures from this image basically you have a

1379
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:23,609
from this image basically you have a product of potentials that account for

1380
01:13:23,609 --> 01:13:29,540
product of potentials that account for the correlations of X i NX j alright and

1381
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:33,209
the correlations of X i NX j alright and for potential define over the clicks x i

1382
01:13:33,209 --> 01:13:36,300
for potential define over the clicks x i and y which are this potential solution

1383
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:44,870
and y which are this potential solution here all right

1384
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:44,880


1385
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,830
again is to play the spoilers rather than or anything this potential

1386
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:52,950
than or anything this potential exclusively is to find them because them

1387
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:54,960
exclusively is to find them because them down in terms of the energy of the

1388
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,360
down in terms of the energy of the system and you remember that and

1389
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,700
system and you remember that and symptoms are eight to the minus the

1390
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:03,750
symptoms are eight to the minus the energy so the energy here it will be

1391
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:07,550
energy so the energy here it will be defined by this little correlation on

1392
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:10,290
defined by this little correlation on that I indicated before between X I and

1393
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:14,310
that I indicated before between X I and X a and X I and Y I so those are the two

1394
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:16,200
X a and X I and Y I so those are the two terms defined over the two cliques but

1395
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:21,030
terms defined over the two cliques but they shall not astronomy term that

1396
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:23,840
they shall not astronomy term that involves summation for the extra light

1397
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,950
involves summation for the extra light okay and usually in physics right the

1398
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:36,810
okay and usually in physics right the term is used to you know pixels in the

1399
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:39,060
term is used to you know pixels in the model like or the concentration or

1400
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:41,130
model like or the concentration or something like that is you sort of

1401
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:46,470
something like that is you sort of characterizing reason all right you can

1402
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:48,780
characterizing reason all right you can think of those X sorry one is not the

1403
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,940
think of those X sorry one is not the maximal clique right but you can think

1404
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:53,310
maximal clique right but you can think it's known as a sub click so if you

1405
01:14:53,310 --> 01:15:07,440
it's known as a sub click so if you throw an extra tab down okay somebody

1406
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,900
throw an extra tab down okay somebody can pose the problem using the data wire

1407
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,940
can pose the problem using the data wire to run computers parameters but right

1408
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:14,940
to run computers parameters but right now let's say you fix them and you don't

1409
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:27,090
now let's say you fix them and you don't you don't worry about J its neighbor and

1410
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:32,250
you don't worry about J its neighbor and X I and why they relate together so I am

1411
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:34,560
X I and why they relate together so I am NOT saying that X I is related to that

1412
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,620
NOT saying that X I is related to that but if you try to write the conditional

1413
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:39,570
but if you try to write the conditional distribution and you say if I can

1414
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:41,580
distribution and you say if I can observe the whole image the noisy

1415
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:45,150
observe the whole image the noisy version why can i compute X what X is

1416
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:47,700
version why can i compute X what X is notice that all the x's are coupled with

1417
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:50,610
notice that all the x's are coupled with the XS a couple with otherwise in both

1418
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:52,330
the XS a couple with otherwise in both potential terms

1419
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:55,180
potential terms all right so when we fight like this

1420
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:59,600
all right so when we fight like this conditional you know this potential for

1421
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,520
conditional you know this potential for water-wise right and this makes the

1422
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:06,050
water-wise right and this makes the problem a little bit tricky on the way

1423
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:10,400
problem a little bit tricky on the way we are going to implement oho me so to

1424
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,320
we are going to implement oho me so to the trivial on bereavement to do this in

1425
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:18,110
the trivial on bereavement to do this in red light so let's say that can we make

1426
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:19,459
red light so let's say that can we make this a homework absolutely

1427
01:16:19,459 --> 01:16:21,170
this a homework absolutely all right just make this a home more

1428
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:24,709
all right just make this a home more because it's his red light I mean this I

1429
01:16:24,709 --> 01:16:27,200
because it's his red light I mean this I have to motivate Subic to write the

1430
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,050
have to motivate Subic to write the right homework or so you keep now it's

1431
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:31,550
right homework or so you keep now it's coming of those become hot ones

1432
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:35,420
coming of those become hot ones ok so here we are this is the original

1433
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,459
ok so here we are this is the original image and user notice is very clean and

1434
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:41,209
image and user notice is very clean and let's say you take the original image

1435
01:16:41,209 --> 01:16:43,070
let's say you take the original image and you perturb you know from black to

1436
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:46,220
and you perturb you know from black to white white black 10% of the pixel

1437
01:16:46,220 --> 01:17:19,010
white white black 10% of the pixel services image and so that's what you

1438
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,770
services image and so that's what you know so when you do this right you're

1439
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,390
know so when you do this right you're asking you know if you want to complete

1440
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:26,780
asking you know if you want to complete with save this you say so you have X

1441
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:28,940
with save this you say so you have X given Y you want to find the x that

1442
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:31,850
given Y you want to find the x that maximize is that posterior of X given Y

1443
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:34,580
maximize is that posterior of X given Y so what you do is much smaller so the

1444
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:36,440
so what you do is much smaller so the probability is the same has been amazing

1445
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,080
probability is the same has been amazing the energy of the system so when you

1446
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:42,590
the energy of the system so when you take a picture you can just back you

1447
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:44,870
take a picture you can just back you complete the energy you share K now let

1448
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:46,910
complete the energy you share K now let me make it wide because the energy goes

1449
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:48,860
me make it wide because the energy goes now if it goes down then you keep it

1450
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:51,440
now if it goes down then you keep it wide and the reversal loops through the

1451
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:55,010
wide and the reversal loops through the pixels right by the director bring them

1452
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:57,290
pixels right by the director bring them up and down alright until you reach the

1453
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:59,520
up and down alright until you reach the minimum energy you can do this

1454
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,309
minimum energy you can do this no we
