1
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,690
throughout this part we supposed to start

2
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,760
start obviously you realize the lectures are

3
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,740
obviously you realize the lectures are videotaped that's why I have to start

4
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,060
videotaped that's why I have to start exactly 1213 I suppose I have your

5
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,550
exactly 1213 I suppose I have your permission with the tape here we are not

6
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,620
permission with the tape here we are not actually in the video but if you say

7
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,430
actually in the video but if you say anything

8
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,310
anything also you don't have to worry because

9
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,620
also you don't have to worry because it's not going to pick you up very micro

10
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,310
it's not going to pick you up very micro points which made but the lectures are

11
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,930
points which made but the lectures are going to be videotaped and posted on the

12
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,630
going to be videotaped and posted on the website of the course and also on what's

13
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,870
website of the course and also on what's the system

14
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880


15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,760
but you know we put the lectures from YouTube so you can download them

16
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,960
YouTube so you can download them directly from the next notes the course

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,080
directly from the next notes the course website it's an under construction which

18
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,580
website it's an under construction which means it's only the link is there the

19
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,060
means it's only the link is there the rest is going to be up when I managed to

20
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,460
rest is going to be up when I managed to get some sleep of 12 hours

21
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,760
get some sleep of 12 hours deadlock okay so maybe tomorrow or

22
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,520
deadlock okay so maybe tomorrow or something you know certainly before the

23
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,069
something you know certainly before the next lecture I hope to have this thing

24
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:14,940
next lecture I hope to have this thing up with today's lecture and video as

25
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,819
up with today's lecture and video as well let's see

26
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,800
well let's see the glass is Tuesdays and Thursdays

27
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,550
the glass is Tuesdays and Thursdays 12:32 unqualified I know there has been

28
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,470
12:32 unqualified I know there has been lots of changes from the timing it's

29
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,430
lots of changes from the timing it's really not something I control when you

30
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,130
really not something I control when you use the lecture room like 126 the

31
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,470
use the lecture room like 126 the Bartolo that has videotaping you know

32
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,780
Bartolo that has videotaping you know everybody wants this room so it's very

33
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,530
everybody wants this room so it's very difficult to watch that

34
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,199
difficult to watch that yes everything is on yeah thank you

35
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,360
yes everything is on yeah thank you thanks for stopping by

36
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,520
thanks for stopping by so this room is on high demand so we

37
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,610
so this room is on high demand so we were in then we were out in and out so

38
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,660
were in then we were out in and out so we are in as of today the Baku next

39
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,280
we are in as of today the Baku next rescue station first place and maybe not

40
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,309
rescue station first place and maybe not every Friday but once a while we're

41
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:07,020
every Friday but once a while we're going to have recitations to get we've

42
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,470
going to have recitations to get we've helped with a homework and in addition

43
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,690
helped with a homework and in addition when there are missing lecture I'm going

44
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,789
when there are missing lecture I'm going to use cry this to cover up for that so

45
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:21,539
to use cry this to cover up for that so let's see what else that's my email

46
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,369
let's see what else that's my email address whatever information you need I

47
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,319
address whatever information you need I want to try to provide it on the course

48
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:31,470
want to try to provide it on the course website okay there's a lots of there you

49
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,360
website okay there's a lots of there you know regarding the course objectives

50
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,099
know regarding the course objectives this is not an application course right

51
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,900
this is not an application course right that don't usually teach application of

52
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,880
that don't usually teach application of courses so Vista course on the

53
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,920
courses so Vista course on the fundamentals of community graphical

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,759
fundamentals of community graphical modules and I remember someone's had

55
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,039
modules and I remember someone's had asked me in the past you know what's

56
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,190
asked me in the past you know what's probabilistic graphical models thinking

57
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,830
probabilistic graphical models thinking must be something graphical you know

58
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,970
must be something graphical you know probably the graphical models is a

59
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,809
probably the graphical models is a constant yet is a way to work with many

60
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:03,330
constant yet is a way to work with many random variables and if you think this

61
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,979
random variables and if you think this many of the valuable some somehow

62
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,050
many of the valuable some somehow interconnected because they are

63
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,110
interconnected because they are correlated there is a graph and then

64
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,670
correlated there is a graph and then maybe we can do some graph theoretic

65
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,059
maybe we can do some graph theoretic approaches to doing transpose but don't

66
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:17,310
approaches to doing transpose but don't expect to have a problem where there is

67
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,560
expect to have a problem where there is a graph and then you say oh do something

68
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,770
a graph and then you say oh do something with this graph the graph is there all

69
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,480
with this graph the graph is there all right so you have to think of something

70
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,060
right so you have to think of something being represented as a graph and I think

71
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,830
being represented as a graph and I think it comes tense that's the most difficult

72
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,980
it comes tense that's the most difficult part of

73
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,860
part of of the of the cost being able to

74
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,939
of the of the cost being able to actually visualize on how what is a good

75
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:39,969
actually visualize on how what is a good model to represent the relations between

76
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:44,350
model to represent the relations between many other body okay so I'm going to try

77
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,040
many other body okay so I'm going to try to give you all the fundamentals to do

78
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,610
to give you all the fundamentals to do inference in graphs and when I talk

79
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,340
inference in graphs and when I talk about the interest rate refer to

80
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,140
about the interest rate refer to Bayesian inference I'm going to discuss

81
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,420
Bayesian inference I'm going to discuss both directed and undirected graphs

82
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,920
both directed and undirected graphs maybe people in social science do

83
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,219
maybe people in social science do psychology they like directed graph

84
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:08,140
psychology they like directed graph people in science and engineering the

85
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,839
people in science and engineering the like undirected graphs but we've

86
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:13,270
like undirected graphs but we've received some how we can connect the

87
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,860
received some how we can connect the different types of graphs we learned one

88
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,170
different types of graphs we learned one all the types quite easily obviously you

89
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,330
all the types quite easily obviously you know I'm going to give you examples here

90
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,860
know I'm going to give you examples here and there represent the potential of

91
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,499
and there represent the potential of using graphical models from standard

92
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,300
using graphical models from standard machine learning problems the computer

93
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,279
machine learning problems the computer vision to doing scientific computing two

94
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,240
vision to doing scientific computing two certifications of natural language

95
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,270
certifications of natural language processing computational biology I don't

96
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,890
processing computational biology I don't believe we have anybody from biology the

97
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,439
believe we have anybody from biology the audience do we

98
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:51,909
audience do we okay

99
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919


100
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,439
obviously nobody does anything related to the type of things so we don't have

101
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,170
to the type of things so we don't have anything any contributions from students

102
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:04,290
anything any contributions from students this year right well the course is

103
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,520
this year right well the course is appropriate basically for students in

104
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,149
appropriate basically for students in math statistics and computer science for

105
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:12,790
math statistics and computer science for students in engineering that have good

106
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,010
students in engineering that have good mathematical skills but very relevant

107
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:19,749
mathematical skills but very relevant and students in all areas of time this

108
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:23,140
and students in all areas of time this including cognitive sciences biology if

109
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,369
including cognitive sciences biology if it's called chemical etc some of this

110
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:29,379
it's called chemical etc some of this course is to not universally so popular

111
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,149
course is to not universally so popular I'd noticed for example you go to

112
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,559
I'd noticed for example you go to Stanford

113
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,450
Stanford the cost is more than click on the

114
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,059
the cost is more than click on the students attending again because there

115
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:41,050
students attending again because there is interest from every direction ok here

116
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,149
is interest from every direction ok here you have the selective ones are not the

117
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:45,429
you have the selective ones are not the same we have the carrots to come and

118
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:47,469
same we have the carrots to come and attend these lectures to Delhi and I

119
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:49,899
attend these lectures to Delhi and I hope to see you on with the next lecture

120
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:52,749
hope to see you on with the next lecture on Thursday as well okay and I hope to

121
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:54,730
on Thursday as well okay and I hope to see you the day after I give the first

122
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,760
see you the day after I give the first homework because usually that's when the

123
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,070
homework because usually that's when the class population goes down by 50%

124
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:08,860
class population goes down by 50% okay now B this is not that caused us to

125
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,980
okay now B this is not that caused us to get four credits I am assuming you only

126
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,540
get four credits I am assuming you only reason you're here is because you want

127
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,420
reason you're here is because you want to learn the topic and integrated with

128
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,579
to learn the topic and integrated with your research and I'm going to help you

129
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,920
your research and I'm going to help you in doing that but if you just need four

130
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,450
in doing that but if you just need four credits this is on the right course for

131
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,439
credits this is on the right course for you okay I want to you know this is a

132
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,010
you okay I want to you know this is a very hot important area in many ways and

133
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,559
very hot important area in many ways and I'm going to educate you but to be able

134
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:34,769
I'm going to educate you but to be able to learn this you need to have and

135
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:36,440
to learn this you need to have and interest from the top

136
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,670
interest from the top if you don't this is not the place to be

137
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,610
if you don't this is not the place to be now the cost you know it's going to be

138
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,160
now the cost you know it's going to be one of the core courses from the new

139
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,440
one of the core courses from the new center for informatics and computational

140
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,940
center for informatics and computational science is basically the second in

141
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,990
science is basically the second in sequence from a course to PI I taught on

142
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,470
sequence from a course to PI I taught on Bayesian statistics in the fall if you

143
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,030
Bayesian statistics in the fall if you don't really need the previous course

144
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,310
don't really need the previous course and if you need something well I mean

145
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,690
and if you need something well I mean when I say you don't need it you need

146
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,880
when I say you don't need it you need everything right the more you know the

147
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,750
everything right the more you know the better but I cannot expect you that you

148
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,310
better but I cannot expect you that you know what was covered to the previous

149
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,800
know what was covered to the previous course so when there are some

150
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,620
course so when there are some fundamental concepts that we need to

151
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,070
fundamental concepts that we need to bring in I will either cover them in

152
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,570
bring in I will either cover them in this course where I will give you know

153
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,370
this course where I will give you know it's basically to read about them I

154
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,640
it's basically to read about them I think and it is possible that I'm gonna

155
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,440
think and it is possible that I'm gonna go back to you some of the topics

156
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,150
go back to you some of the topics covered in the poll anyways but try to

157
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,440
covered in the poll anyways but try to address them in a graph theoretic wonder

158
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,810
address them in a graph theoretic wonder okay so new algorithmic problems we

159
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,200
okay so new algorithmic problems we cover for example related to data

160
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,190
cover for example related to data stimulation so you need to know

161
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,570
stimulation so you need to know probability theory you don't know

162
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,100
probability theory you don't know anything about probabilities period will

163
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,540
anything about probabilities period will disappoint you you need to know the

164
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,880
disappoint you you need to know the fundamentals at least Vegas rules and

165
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,340
fundamentals at least Vegas rules and the lights about Bayesian inference and

166
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:10,610
the lights about Bayesian inference and if we have taken even an introductory

167
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,770
if we have taken even an introductory cost to must in learning may be useful

168
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,700
cost to must in learning may be useful okay

169
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,320
okay machine learning for me means

170
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,700
machine learning for me means computational statistics

171
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,269
computational statistics so whatever we need I will bring it back

172
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:27,300
so whatever we need I will bring it back for your convenience but it is going to

173
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,130
for your convenience but it is going to be helpful if you have a book in your

174
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,180
be helpful if you have a book in your desk but you can look for information

175
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,470
desk but you can look for information okay and I'm going to give you lots of

176
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,500
okay and I'm going to give you lots of readings that you can go through this

177
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,230
readings that you can go through this semester and also after the course is

178
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,720
semester and also after the course is over you need to know programming

179
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,060
over you need to know programming because we will make an effort every

180
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,790
because we will make an effort every homework didn't have a computational

181
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,470
homework didn't have a computational problem and we're going to try to do

182
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,480
problem and we're going to try to do this even on the first homework these

183
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,820
this even on the first homework these are the first home mortgage deduction

184
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,860
are the first home mortgage deduction calculations but what going sort of to

185
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,889
calculations but what going sort of to try to give you a computer assignment

186
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:06,180
try to give you a computer assignment simply because we you know we want to

187
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,889
simply because we you know we want to precise this because that these

188
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:11,370
precise this because that these computers is not to do ten calculations

189
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,780
computers is not to do ten calculations there's too much you know computation

190
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,810
there's too much you know computation and ten calculations were not tempted to

191
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:26,520
and ten calculations were not tempted to do any serious problems okay all right

192
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:26,530


193
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:32,670
like in the fall semester of relying on the help from others around the court

194
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,650
the help from others around the court so dr. Rubik Chakraborty this neck you

195
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,470
so dr. Rubik Chakraborty this neck you know the over there with his mark is

196
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,180
know the over there with his mark is going is volunteering to help with some

197
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,140
going is volunteering to help with some of the vegetation preparing some of the

198
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,600
of the vegetation preparing some of the homework solutions and also doing some

199
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,790
homework solutions and also doing some of the grading and so he's gone around

200
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,940
of the grading and so he's gone around the resistance and maybe once if I give

201
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:04,460
the resistance and maybe once if I give a lecture or two when I'm out of town so

202
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,460
a lecture or two when I'm out of town so the homework is going to be submitted

203
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,100
the homework is going to be submitted electronically to this email address I'm

204
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,750
electronically to this email address I'm going to provide more information on the

205
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,880
going to provide more information on the website in the cover that you need to

206
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,000
website in the cover that you need to submit the homework this address may

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,190
submit the homework this address may change actually by tomorrow that's why I

208
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,070
change actually by tomorrow that's why I said this email address this is a Google

209
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,290
said this email address this is a Google email account but you may have made

210
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:32,370
email account but you may have made design one just for this class okay

211
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:32,380


212
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:38,040
I notice some of you look worn oh yes you know we like typed homework because

213
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,370
you know we like typed homework because it is for me especially computational

214
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,640
it is for me especially computational silence and writing by 10:00 there's no

215
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,440
silence and writing by 10:00 there's no way we can figure out what you're

216
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,840
way we can figure out what you're writing there if you write if you type

217
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,150
writing there if you write if you type something nice to me it is very easy to

218
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,950
something nice to me it is very easy to know what is going on okay

219
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,500
know what is going on okay so indeed with preferred type homework

220
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,350
so indeed with preferred type homework but some of your lazy and I'm referring

221
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,530
but some of your lazy and I'm referring to my students my own students so for

222
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,890
to my students my own students so for those who are lazy you can stop the you

223
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,050
those who are lazy you can stop the you can stick on your homework and stormy if

224
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,780
can stick on your homework and stormy if there's a PDF attachment okay if you do

225
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,940
there's a PDF attachment okay if you do this thing's might can't ask me you will

226
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,920
this thing's might can't ask me you will identify 90% of the mistakes in your

227
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,770
identify 90% of the mistakes in your homework just by typing it slowly and

228
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,540
homework just by typing it slowly and looking at it say oh it doesn't look

229
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,790
looking at it say oh it doesn't look good and it doesn't look good mint is

230
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,600
good and it doesn't look good mint is wrong okay but if you tied by hand it

231
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,390
wrong okay but if you tied by hand it never looks good so you never have lost

232
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,350
never looks good so you never have lost is it right because most of the time is

233
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:36,450
is it right because most of the time is wrong okay so we learnt that convert not

234
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,070
wrong okay so we learnt that convert not to mention you know what if you type

235
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,920
to mention you know what if you type this nice 3 tomorrow you go for a job

236
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,660
this nice 3 tomorrow you go for a job interview and you say yeah I took this

237
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,420
interview and you say yeah I took this course and here is what I did and that

238
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,910
course and here is what I did and that counts a lot ok because this is not

239
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:56,010
counts a lot ok because this is not intro to happy hour type of port let's

240
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,210
intro to happy hour type of port let's see the information on how you have to

241
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,770
see the information on how you have to touch your homeworks and how to name

242
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,350
touch your homeworks and how to name your submission again sir I will give

243
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,730
your submission again sir I will give that information of the website MOOCs

244
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,700
that information of the website MOOCs I'm gonna start actually in different

245
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,540
I'm gonna start actually in different orders from what is given here the this

246
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,810
orders from what is given here the this book by Michael Jordan and introductions

247
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,700
book by Michael Jordan and introductions published graphical models is actually

248
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,810
published graphical models is actually what is used in

249
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:27,160
what is used in most universities for breeding and it's

250
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,550
most universities for breeding and it's actually turtlecom

251
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,930
actually turtlecom you know everybody's taste in

252
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,450
you know everybody's taste in preparation reprint this book has been

253
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,680
preparation reprint this book has been in preparation for 25 years which means

254
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,269
in preparation for 25 years which means professor jonathan has given up

255
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,120
professor jonathan has given up basically because things are changing so

256
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,740
basically because things are changing so rapidly it's like what's the point of

257
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,290
rapidly it's like what's the point of finishing this book now okay and so

258
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,230
finishing this book now okay and so versus actually the easiest and the most

259
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,720
versus actually the easiest and the most insightful reading that you can have and

260
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,000
insightful reading that you can have and for those who register in the course I

261
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,960
for those who register in the course I am going to send you a PDF so I

262
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,360
am going to send you a PDF so I shouldn't be saying this on faith

263
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,100
shouldn't be saying this on faith somehow you've been going to library

264
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:15,220
somehow you've been going to library find it okay all right the let's see if

265
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,740
find it okay all right the let's see if you really want to do research in this

266
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,130
you really want to do research in this area a heavy book that you need to have

267
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,920
area a heavy book that you need to have in your desk is the textbook by Colin is

268
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,540
in your desk is the textbook by Colin is written is more than a thousand pages

269
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,190
written is more than a thousand pages maybe 1,200 pages has a lot of

270
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,490
maybe 1,200 pages has a lot of information some we will cover it in

271
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,640
information some we will cover it in this course in detail some all the

272
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,519
this course in detail some all the details you don't need them but toughen

273
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,090
details you don't need them but toughen the vistas the state of the art both in

274
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,670
the vistas the state of the art both in theory and algorithms so business you

275
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,019
theory and algorithms so business you know recommended book basically or you

276
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:50,980
know recommended book basically or you know

277
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,960
know to have the the textbook that we usually

278
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:03,250
to have the the textbook that we usually fit last fall by Kevin Rushdie has you

279
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,630
fit last fall by Kevin Rushdie has you know it's like an encyclopedia of

280
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,940
know it's like an encyclopedia of machine learning it's not really a

281
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,610
machine learning it's not really a readable text book but it has lots of

282
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,160
readable text book but it has lots of new algorithm still much more modern

283
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,980
new algorithm still much more modern Abroad's and it has a structural also

284
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,990
Abroad's and it has a structural also that goes with all the examples in the

285
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,910
that goes with all the examples in the book which I recommend it right and it

286
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,230
book which I recommend it right and it is actually less probabilistic than for

287
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:31,120
is actually less probabilistic than for example Jordan's reprint okay

288
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,970
example Jordan's reprint okay it used likes to use point estimates for

289
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,220
it used likes to use point estimates for fast inference for most of the

290
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,460
fast inference for most of the algorithms but you know there are I

291
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,019
algorithms but you know there are I don't know six seven chapters are

292
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:42,670
don't know six seven chapters are thinking for published graphical models

293
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,230
thinking for published graphical models and we will cover at least the essential

294
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,920
and we will cover at least the essential parts of those this of just one chapter

295
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,840
parts of those this of just one chapter on probabilistic graphical models that

296
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,470
on probabilistic graphical models that is actually an ideal read if you want to

297
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,040
is actually an ideal read if you want to know everything about this court before

298
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,740
know everything about this court before we even start to get a good stance let's

299
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,519
we even start to get a good stance let's say this week is to read what's after is

300
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:12,280
say this week is to read what's after is it a a so if you're in separate even

301
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,930
it a a so if you're in separate even just without the details alright just

302
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,370
just without the details alright just going through it it would serve you

303
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:22,410
going through it it would serve you extremely well because it has everything

304
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,329
extremely well because it has everything not loops or anything like that but has

305
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,740
not loops or anything like that but has the lots of insights as to what

306
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,480
the lots of insights as to what probabilistic graphical models are and

307
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,329
probabilistic graphical models are and how to go about okay

308
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:34,990
how to go about okay so certainly this would be a good start

309
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,949
so certainly this would be a good start point and also if he has the cube has

310
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:43,199
point and also if he has the cube has many other things that utilized the

311
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,949
many other things that utilized the machinery of probabilistic graphical

312
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:46,750
machinery of probabilistic graphical models that we will also use in this

313
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,590
models that we will also use in this course 16 readable most probably

314
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,750
course 16 readable most probably the most readable book on machine

315
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,850
the most readable book on machine learning in the market and even watched

316
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,770
learning in the market and even watched about 20 years tall you will find it I

317
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,110
about 20 years tall you will find it I pressed when I read it every other day I

318
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:09,410
pressed when I read it every other day I find something new there okay and so I

319
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:14,170
find something new there okay and so I obviously I recommend all of this book

320
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,640
obviously I recommend all of this book okay grading so we're going to have six

321
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,790
okay grading so we're going to have six homework the homework will be 60% of the

322
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,670
homework the homework will be 60% of the grades and it be a project 40% for some

323
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:27,170
grades and it be a project 40% for some maybe that's too much you know but if

324
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,170
maybe that's too much you know but if you think about it no exams no meters no

325
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,090
you think about it no exams no meters no finals

326
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,340
finals nothing okay so this is a gradual course

327
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,980
nothing okay so this is a gradual course we don't operate the classical way but

328
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,350
we don't operate the classical way but the expectations are higher than giving

329
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,360
the expectations are higher than giving an example you write something wrong

330
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,190
an example you write something wrong page that say congratulations we pass

331
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:49,070
page that say congratulations we pass the course right so the project it the

332
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,660
the course right so the project it the program we have to change the leave it

333
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,810
program we have to change the leave it from those who took the course in in the

334
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,670
from those who took the course in in the poll because I was very disappointed

335
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,830
poll because I was very disappointed with the attitude of many students here

336
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,510
with the attitude of many students here when it comes to the course to the

337
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,140
when it comes to the course to the project

338
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,660
project I get freedom to everybody to define

339
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,060
I get freedom to everybody to define their own project relevant to the course

340
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,950
their own project relevant to the course and I can tell you there were at least

341
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,550
and I can tell you there were at least seven students who came up with a new

342
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,370
seven students who came up with a new definition of the project about three

343
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,230
definition of the project about three days before the presentation

344
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,670
days before the presentation I mean asked not normal just ridiculous

345
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:27,380
I mean asked not normal just ridiculous okay so so I don't know exactly how

346
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,080
okay so so I don't know exactly how we're going to do it but I'm gonna think

347
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,420
we're going to do it but I'm gonna think in the next two or three weeks but the

348
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,880
in the next two or three weeks but the possibility would be to actually

349
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,310
possibility would be to actually literally five you ten twenty projects

350
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,710
literally five you ten twenty projects and save it to Z and here are the

351
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,170
and save it to Z and here are the references become whatever you like and

352
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,520
references become whatever you like and do one of those and you cannot say

353
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,740
do one of those and you cannot say right well we may do it as last fall but

354
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,720
right well we may do it as last fall but with strict guidelines that you changed

355
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,810
with strict guidelines that you changed project means you get zero breaking your

356
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,470
project means you get zero breaking your project

357
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,810
project we cannot allow basically a week before

358
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,300
we cannot allow basically a week before the representation solidifying what the

359
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,850
the representation solidifying what the project is and I'm not talking about the

360
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,440
project is and I'm not talking about the trying a little bit I'm talking about

361
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,170
trying a little bit I'm talking about going from A to Z okay not to mention

362
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,790
going from A to Z okay not to mention going from A to Z and SIF having no

363
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,960
going from A to Z and SIF having no relation to the course at all right so

364
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,560
relation to the course at all right so that's number I take so certainly I want

365
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,060
that's number I take so certainly I want with the project to give you an

366
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,190
with the project to give you an opportunity to do something that is

367
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,570
opportunity to do something that is relevant to your research right so that

368
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,520
relevant to your research right so that not only you benefit because you learn

369
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,810
not only you benefit because you learn the material of the course for those

370
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,720
the material of the course for those strong you benefit because the course in

371
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,250
strong you benefit because the course in fact you're already served and that's

372
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:45,880
fact you're already served and that's very important okay so now because of so

373
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,460
very important okay so now because of so the the project is going to require a

374
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,460
the the project is going to require a report which is not limited to six pages

375
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,250
report which is not limited to six pages a written presentation like PowerPoint

376
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,360
a written presentation like PowerPoint of Beamer and another presentation and

377
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,120
of Beamer and another presentation and because we have two dates in the fall

378
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,830
because we have two dates in the fall with scheduling with our presentations

379
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,620
with scheduling with our presentations and videotaping them have not seen any

380
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,650
and videotaping them have not seen any of the videos yet by the way of artists

381
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,450
of the videos yet by the way of artists presentations yet because they have not

382
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,530
presentations yet because they have not been provided to me but have what we're

383
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,660
been provided to me but have what we're going to do to avoid all that the next

384
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,330
going to do to avoid all that the next weekend we're going to take maybe the

385
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,160
weekend we're going to take maybe the last three or four lectures of the

386
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,900
last three or four lectures of the course and we're going to have the

387
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,120
course and we're going to have the presentations in class so you're going

388
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,950
presentations in class so you're going to be on this real video and not

389
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,980
to be on this real video and not issue because the videos are automatic

390
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,360
issue because the videos are automatic okay so we don't have to worry about

391
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,020
okay so we don't have to worry about story there's nothing available in May

392
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,170
story there's nothing available in May sorry

393
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,660
sorry in June this building is closed in July

394
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,800
in June this building is closed in July is open for something else and that

395
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,990
is open for something else and that we're gonna do it in class even if that

396
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,230
we're gonna do it in class even if that takes lecture so be prepared the that

397
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,220
takes lecture so be prepared the that the project would be you wave before the

398
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,920
the project would be you wave before the end of the semester the wave means you

399
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,620
end of the semester the wave means you know three lectures of this before the

400
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,200
know three lectures of this before the end of the semester so we're gonna have

401
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
end of the semester so we're gonna have to move on the projects quite strong

402
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,770
to move on the projects quite strong okay the services are very preliminary

403
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,150
okay the services are very preliminary so some of these topics we may cover

404
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,130
so some of these topics we may cover them in lots of details but some not

405
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,780
them in lots of details but some not we're going to discuss as I mentioned

406
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,900
we're going to discuss as I mentioned directive of the undirected graph this

407
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,700
directive of the undirected graph this should be of interest to everybody but

408
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,750
should be of interest to everybody but mainly you know in social and in social

409
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,900
mainly you know in social and in social sciences natural language modeling

410
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,270
sciences natural language modeling things I thought market models are

411
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,070
things I thought market models are basically essential for people to work

412
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:45,500
basically essential for people to work in scientific applications we're going

413
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,660
in scientific applications we're going to do it lots of 12 hours for data

414
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,340
to do it lots of 12 hours for data simulation problems starting with

415
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,720
simulation problems starting with basically a little relating everything

416
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,250
basically a little relating everything that you may already know from other

417
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,430
that you may already know from other courses or not some of these topics we

418
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,270
courses or not some of these topics we cover them and in the fall so ideas for

419
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,180
cover them and in the fall so ideas for example of doing dynamical systems with

420
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,130
example of doing dynamical systems with particle methods now we will see how to

421
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,190
particle methods now we will see how to develop the same identical algorithms

422
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,280
develop the same identical algorithms but with a graph theoretic approach so

423
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,510
but with a graph theoretic approach so for example you can think of doing

424
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,520
for example you can think of doing Kalman filtering and generalization

425
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,470
Kalman filtering and generalization always with no effort using algorithms

426
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,420
always with no effort using algorithms on graphs

427
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,990
on graphs nothing new but the risk of slipping

428
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,880
nothing new but the risk of slipping would grass you babel action to develop

429
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,890
would grass you babel action to develop your own Oliver effect you want to that

430
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,380
your own Oliver effect you want to that this extension of standard methodologies

431
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,300
this extension of standard methodologies that have been around for thirty years

432
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,310


433
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:45,840
we're gonna spend maybe more than two lectures may be anything from five to

434
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,300
lectures may be anything from five to ten lectures to discuss inference in

435
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,960
ten lectures to discuss inference in graphs and this concept of exacting

436
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,680
graphs and this concept of exacting first of course is you know it's not

437
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,900
first of course is you know it's not always possible so we are gonna start

438
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,840
always possible so we are gonna start with this and then we will so we will

439
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,970
with this and then we will so we will cover as part of exactly current idea so

440
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,690
cover as part of exactly current idea so far the new propagation destruction pre

441
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,590
far the new propagation destruction pre algorithm elimination and the light will

442
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,160
algorithm elimination and the light will discuss about approximate inference

443
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,670
discuss about approximate inference using generalizations of means you know

444
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,910
using generalizations of means you know means till the type of algorithms so

445
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:28,440
means till the type of algorithms so this is an important area and it

446
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,610
this is an important area and it actually an earlier that literally goes

447
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,170
actually an earlier that literally goes coefficient with graph theoretic

448
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,600
coefficient with graph theoretic algorithms so this will be an essential

449
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,840
algorithms so this will be an essential part of the cost and if we have time I

450
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,750
part of the cost and if we have time I think maybe we spend two three lectures

451
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,690
think maybe we spend two three lectures to discussed on how do you learn the

452
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,280
to discussed on how do you learn the structure of a graph so if somebody for

453
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,260
structure of a graph so if somebody for hours view realizations for a few

454
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,390
hours view realizations for a few hundred of variables and you want to

455
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,450
hundred of variables and you want to figure out how they are correlated how

456
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,050
figure out how they are correlated how do we do this how do you come up with

457
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,550
do we do this how do you come up with learning destruction of a graph and of

458
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,160
learning destruction of a graph and of course we've realized the this is a very

459
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,760
course we've realized the this is a very difficult open problem right so this is

460
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,140
difficult open problem right so this is actually the fantastic area to do a PhD

461
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:13,020
actually the fantastic area to do a PhD not one piece P you can work for 100

462
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,630
not one piece P you can work for 100 feet this because I don't believe this

463
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,350
feet this because I don't believe this problem can be scaled

464
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,510
problem can be scaled many of the variables alright but it's

465
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:25,049
many of the variables alright but it's an important topic that is to be

466
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:28,169
an important topic that is to be discussed so the lectures will give in

467
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:31,919
discussed so the lectures will give in the tape I think we think an hour two of

468
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,000
the tape I think we think an hour two of the lectures are available on Sakai when

469
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,570
the lectures are available on Sakai when the website is up if not today tomorrow

470
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,120
the website is up if not today tomorrow we will post these videotapes the on

471
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,390
we will post these videotapes the on YouTube so will be that youtube link

472
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:48,930
YouTube so will be that youtube link where the lecture PDFs will be posted

473
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,940
where the lecture PDFs will be posted I hesitate actually have to think about

474
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,549
I hesitate actually have to think about this if I want to post the lectures like

475
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:55,950
this if I want to post the lectures like we did in the fall so that you have them

476
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,840
we did in the fall so that you have them in front of you during the lectures

477
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,440
in front of you during the lectures because I was observing certain

478
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,299
because I was observing certain individuals in this room but they are

479
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:04,799
individuals in this room but they are still clear okay

480
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,419
still clear okay during my lectures basically doing

481
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:08,039
during my lectures basically doing nothing else but just looking on that

482
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,610
nothing else but just looking on that computer that's not the way to go I mean

483
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,440
computer that's not the way to go I mean why have you you know I mean they are

484
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,820
why have you you know I mean they are looking at bookkeeping you can look at

485
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,010
looking at bookkeeping you can look at form right since the business will be

486
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,630
form right since the business will be available this you need to come to them

487
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,030
available this you need to come to them I mean make me spill good of course if

488
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:25,260
I mean make me spill good of course if you come and I appreciate but I think

489
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:32,870
you come and I appreciate but I think the idea is to be able to benefit even

490
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,750
the idea is to be able to benefit even partially by listening in person to

491
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,090
partially by listening in person to these lectures okay but for sure the

492
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,220
these lectures okay but for sure the lectures will be positive if not before

493
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,530
lectures will be positive if not before immediately after you know you know in

494
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,980
immediately after you know you know in the afternoon of the same day there will

495
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,950
the afternoon of the same day there will be a lots of references of papers and

496
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,750
be a lots of references of papers and books and things I got that I will link

497
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,600
books and things I got that I will link to the lectures so consider those as

498
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,539
to the lectures so consider those as very useful readings and also there will

499
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,480
very useful readings and also there will be a lot of chalkboard links that you

500
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,500
be a lot of chalkboard links that you can use this well why would I forgot

501
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,470
can use this well why would I forgot this because we're video tape I want to

502
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,720
this because we're video tape I want to encourage questions but I'm gonna have

503
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,390
encourage questions but I'm gonna have to repeat your questions

504
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,640
to repeat your questions otherwise nobody Houston anything okay

505
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,500
otherwise nobody Houston anything okay so let me stop there any questions about

506
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,590
so let me stop there any questions about the structure of it all really there's

507
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,420
the structure of it all really there's no structure I mean we do anything we

508
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,460
no structure I mean we do anything we want to we can change our mind tomorrow

509
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,690
want to we can change our mind tomorrow all right

510
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,480
all right we are interest money to learn and not

511
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,120
we are interest money to learn and not to go from A to B to C because I there's

512
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,290
to go from A to B to C because I there's no such a thing okay so and feel free to

513
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:50,510
no such a thing okay so and feel free to take advantage drop any questions

514
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:50,520


515
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:57,230
of course the question I have to ask is how many of you will love stick with us

516
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,070
how many of you will love stick with us on Thursday

517
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,070
on Thursday alright and I hope everybody alright

518
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,690
alright and I hope everybody alright bring the cousins - okay we need all the

519
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:11,650
bring the cousins - okay we need all the support we can get

520
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:11,660


521
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:18,520
I mean one of my students is teaching now at Purdue similar course as the one

522
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,570
now at Purdue similar course as the one without clearing in the fall more or

523
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,180
without clearing in the fall more or less things are a little more basic but

524
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,310
less things are a little more basic but she told me she has more than 60 they

525
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,200
she told me she has more than 60 they had to limit the cluster talents was

526
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,330
had to limit the cluster talents was fixed it because they were students from

527
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,760
fixed it because they were students from every quarter interested but you know

528
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,920
every quarter interested but you know here we're a small population so we

529
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,370
here we're a small population so we don't have the Nutri of 60 20 is

530
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,230
don't have the Nutri of 60 20 is actually a great number for example for

531
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:46,450
actually a great number for example for okay but you guys need to not to give up

532
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,850
okay but you guys need to not to give up when I give homework okay if you do give

533
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:54,940
when I give homework okay if you do give up I'm sorry for you all right so no

534
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,649
up I'm sorry for you all right so no questions

535
00:27:58,649 --> 00:27:58,659


536
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:09,180
any questions just to entertain the thing no but the way whichever I know

537
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,680
thing no but the way whichever I know who have at least and students that will

538
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,350
who have at least and students that will be listening to be stopped from various

539
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:24,360
be listening to be stopped from various places overseas okay I have been

540
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,580
places overseas okay I have been surprised the receiving names of

541
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,129
surprised the receiving names of students from certain universities in

542
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:32,119
students from certain universities in China but they even do the homework and

543
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,350
China but they even do the homework and they submit me corrections to the

544
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,980
they submit me corrections to the homework okay so and corrections to the

545
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,399
homework okay so and corrections to the software of the homework the case though

546
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:45,509
software of the homework the case though and I have seen the impact some of this

547
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:49,830
and I have seen the impact some of this lectures have had on various health so

548
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,019
lectures have had on various health so it served quite rewarding

549
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:55,499
it served quite rewarding okay so we're going to start with sort

550
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:57,990
okay so we're going to start with sort of some elementary introduction to

551
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,649
of some elementary introduction to control in a geographical borders

552
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:03,869
control in a geographical borders discussing some terminology maybe one or

553
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:08,549
discussing some terminology maybe one or two basic examples I am NOT gonna do any

554
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:10,560
two basic examples I am NOT gonna do any mathematics linear questions or anything

555
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,350
mathematics linear questions or anything like that but

556
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:18,389
like that but so if you see saying things that really

557
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:21,180
so if you see saying things that really require a lot of explanations keep in

558
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,499
require a lot of explanations keep in mind and when I come back to those

559
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:25,139
mind and when I come back to those topics and discuss them in detail as we

560
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,389
topics and discuss them in detail as we go along right so this is just to give

561
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:30,419
go along right so this is just to give you a flavor of what a probabilistic

562
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:33,210
you a flavor of what a probabilistic graphical model is and what the type of

563
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,740
graphical model is and what the type of promise were interested by the way in

564
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,430
promise were interested by the way in addition to the video lectures if from

565
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,740
addition to the video lectures if from our course if you served with the

566
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,499
our course if you served with the constant form you say probabilistic

567
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:48,269
constant form you say probabilistic graphical models you will find notes

568
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:54,320
graphical models you will find notes from many short court system here have

569
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,240
from many short court system here have heroes living divani and Christmas of

570
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,430
heroes living divani and Christmas of have a series of lectures on

571
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,690
have a series of lectures on probabilistic graphical

572
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,880
probabilistic graphical with videos and PDFs but you know you

573
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,900
with videos and PDFs but you know you can find online

574
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,480
can find online the Stanford courses and many other

575
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,960
the Stanford courses and many other universities the courses from Cornell

576
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,720
universities the courses from Cornell etc so you can sort of if you have

577
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,790
etc so you can sort of if you have questions with a certain topic

578
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,520
questions with a certain topic if you turn you'll be able to find a lot

579
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,120
if you turn you'll be able to find a lot of resources I think the good thing is

580
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,760
of resources I think the good thing is this area of machine learning it's an

581
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,120
this area of machine learning it's an area of a very open society that likes

582
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,970
area of a very open society that likes things out there to be open okay we

583
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,980
things out there to be open okay we don't hide anything everybody can

584
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,840
don't hide anything everybody can actually benefit and we like it that way

585
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:39,850


586
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:50,950
so we're really probabilistic graphical models just to model the relations

587
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:57,180
models just to model the relations between many random variables okay so

588
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:01,150
between many random variables okay so now effectively would be a way to

589
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,090
now effectively would be a way to produce the joint probability of this

590
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,900
produce the joint probability of this body most so X here is a vector so the

591
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,430
body most so X here is a vector so the probabilistic graphical models will give

592
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,490
probabilistic graphical models will give us sort of file an efficient way to

593
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,810
us sort of file an efficient way to model this distribution fire fact and

594
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,700
model this distribution fire fact and something that we would need to be able

595
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,540
something that we would need to be able to take advantage when we work with

596
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,310
to take advantage when we work with grouches we're going to be able to

597
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,260
grouches we're going to be able to account for the independent relations

598
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:31,740
account for the independent relations between these variables by somehow

599
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:31,750


600
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:37,000
dropping some links from the graph as we wish it softly all right so I have these

601
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,280
wish it softly all right so I have these two variables and they're not connected

602
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,700
two variables and they're not connected darkus an implication probabilistically

603
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,400
darkus an implication probabilistically speaking so the idea here would be that

604
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,610
speaking so the idea here would be that the joint probability distribution when

605
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,560
the joint probability distribution when it is factorized according to a graph or

606
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,780
it is factorized according to a graph or a graph is not right the model in the

607
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,440
a graph is not right the model in the police relations

608
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,539
police relations you know inside this probability

609
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:03,049
you know inside this probability distribution if we do that we will be

610
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:06,440
distribution if we do that we will be able to take advantage of inference

611
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,409
able to take advantage of inference algorithms but still very nicely in

612
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:13,490
algorithms but still very nicely in graphs all right and in some of the

613
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,769
graphs all right and in some of the solvent you used completely graph

614
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,950
solvent you used completely graph theoretic sort of argument and so they

615
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:25,370
theoretic sort of argument and so they are very convenient now if somebody if

616
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,409
are very convenient now if somebody if you if I give you let's say 50 variables

617
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:28,909
you if I give you let's say 50 variables and you learn the joint probability

618
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:30,950
and you learn the joint probability distribution and somehow you can

619
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,710
distribution and somehow you can factorize in some nice way the main

620
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,450
factorize in some nice way the main interest will be to do inference which

621
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,310
interest will be to do inference which means if I knowledge say this stand

622
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,039
means if I knowledge say this stand variables what's the probability of very

623
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:44,930
variables what's the probability of very many variables all right and so we're

624
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,000
many variables all right and so we're going to have to do somehow develop some

625
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,629
going to have to do somehow develop some algorithms that will allow us to compute

626
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:52,759
algorithms that will allow us to compute marginal and conditional distributions

627
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:55,399
marginal and conditional distributions out of this joint distribution the Adisa

628
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:57,799
out of this joint distribution the Adisa Teno the joint we should be able to do

629
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:00,860
Teno the joint we should be able to do lots of things cheaply and in particular

630
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,759
lots of things cheaply and in particular that will be the case for graphs now

631
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:06,019
that will be the case for graphs now when you have a joint distribution like

632
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:09,169
when you have a joint distribution like that you will always have lots of

633
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:10,879
that you will always have lots of unknown parameters to define the joint

634
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:14,830
unknown parameters to define the joint distribution so one of the tasks in

635
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,029
distribution so one of the tasks in probabilistic graphical model is to

636
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:19,490
probabilistic graphical model is to figure out what those parameters are

637
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,500
figure out what those parameters are given realizations of some random

638
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,370
given realizations of some random variables okay so we would see examples

639
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:30,040
variables okay so we would see examples of that

640
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,050


641
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:35,590
let's go so probably a feminist is basically for military plus graph theory

642
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,530
basically for military plus graph theory okay

643
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,420
okay we obviously we won't drop it because

644
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,780
we obviously we won't drop it because we're graph speak we can visualize the

645
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,420
we're graph speak we can visualize the independence relation between the many

646
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,840
independence relation between the many of the variables and once we do that we

647
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,610
of the variables and once we do that we can motivate the lots of new algorithms

648
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:56,650
can motivate the lots of new algorithms I mean the posture can tell you when I

649
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,870
I mean the posture can tell you when I was interested in solving some weird

650
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,510
was interested in solving some weird multi scale problems I've as long as

651
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,400
multi scale problems I've as long as visualizing of how this may look like

652
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,980
visualizing of how this may look like and everybody thought that was an idiot

653
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,800
and everybody thought that was an idiot because somehow they couldn't see how

654
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,690
because somehow they couldn't see how probabilistic graphical model can be

655
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,389
probabilistic graphical model can be relevant but if it is here then you

656
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,550
relevant but if it is here then you should be able to put it in a computer

657
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,810
should be able to put it in a computer program okay

658
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:21,840
program okay so visualizing the structure of a

659
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,240
so visualizing the structure of a probability model of thing is essential

660
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,800
probability model of thing is essential to get nice algorithms all right so

661
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,540
to get nice algorithms all right so we're going to develop algorithms that

662
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,649
we're going to develop algorithms that they take advantage of this graph

663
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:38,230
they take advantage of this graph structure so we're going to be able to

664
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,510
structure so we're going to be able to do inference learning and all of these

665
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,850
do inference learning and all of these things affected in the graphs and the

666
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,070
things affected in the graphs and the ideas for example of these masters

667
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,370
ideas for example of these masters passing algorithms will be something

668
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:51,070
passing algorithms will be something that you cannot do without a graph

669
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:56,770
that you cannot do without a graph theoretic approach

670
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:56,780


671
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:03,580
so the benefit you get in sizing for the model you look actually graphically and

672
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:07,510
model you look actually graphically and you can say lots of things as to how the

673
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,240
you can say lots of things as to how the around the variables correlate to each

674
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,720
around the variables correlate to each other you can develop many new

675
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,070
other you can develop many new algorithms by playing with the structure

676
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,770
algorithms by playing with the structure of the graph and most of the inference

677
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:26,230
of the graph and most of the inference we will do in this course can scale

678
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,810
we will do in this course can scale nicely simply because of this

679
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,530
nicely simply because of this independence relations but implied by by

680
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:39,760
independence relations but implied by by the gun action and actually I can tell

681
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,349
the gun action and actually I can tell you that's quite all you don't need to

682
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:44,620
you that's quite all you don't need to know anything as a background all the

683
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,109
know anything as a background all the calculations always in machine learning

684
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:48,880
calculations always in machine learning there are nothing else but applications

685
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,130
there are nothing else but applications of the solid product rules of

686
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,190
of the solid product rules of probability and we will see this

687
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,630
probability and we will see this something on Thursday when we develop

688
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,540
something on Thursday when we develop simple things on graphs so realist you

689
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,940
simple things on graphs so realist you know the definitions of probabilities

690
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,210
know the definitions of probabilities and what the stomach for the fruits are

691
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,589
and what the stomach for the fruits are then you are ready best bid to do lots

692
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:12,930
then you are ready best bid to do lots of nice things

693
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:12,940


694
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:19,640
but I told you that don't be scared I power lots of concepts because we will

695
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,150
power lots of concepts because we will develop all of this in separate lectures

696
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,500
develop all of this in separate lectures so I'm just throwing this as an

697
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,890
so I'm just throwing this as an introduction so the dart is going to

698
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,370
introduction so the dart is going to encode the whatever independence

699
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:36,630
encode the whatever independence assumptions exist for my many random

700
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:42,540
assumptions exist for my many random variables all right and basically we'll

701
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,730
variables all right and basically we'll be able to factorize the probability

702
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:48,150
be able to factorize the probability distribution on the graph or given a

703
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,730
distribution on the graph or given a graph we will know what type of

704
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,800
graph we will know what type of factorization the graph complies for the

705
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,490
factorization the graph complies for the probability distributions that we define

706
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:59,430
probability distributions that we define the idea is that somehow this

707
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,770
the idea is that somehow this factorization of the joint probability

708
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,380
factorization of the joint probability distribution of the graph would be with

709
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,290
distribution of the graph would be with local functions that are defined on the

710
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:11,910
local functions that are defined on the notes of the graph so these local

711
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,809
notes of the graph so these local functions will be different things for

712
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:18,329
functions will be different things for directed graph which we also called the

713
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:20,400
directed graph which we also called the Bayesian networks and will be different

714
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,180
Bayesian networks and will be different for undirected graphs that also we call

715
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,809
for undirected graphs that also we call them a mark of network okay but the idea

716
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:31,319
them a mark of network okay but the idea is somehow a joint distribution between

717
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:33,450
is somehow a joint distribution between many of our variables can be written as

718
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:39,240
many of our variables can be written as a product of local functions and this is

719
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,520
a product of local functions and this is great right but it's not so physically

720
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,859
great right but it's not so physically what you very did because if for example

721
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:45,569
what you very did because if for example you think spatially many of the

722
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:47,520
you think spatially many of the variables the variables here don't

723
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,680
variables the variables here don't depend on the volume is their right

724
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,050
depend on the volume is their right correlation sort of local extent so

725
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,599
correlation sort of local extent so somehow if you can arrange these things

726
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:57,680
somehow if you can arrange these things to the graph you have a similar nature

727
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,290
to the graph you have a similar nature you will be able to do lots of work that

728
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:05,670
you will be able to do lots of work that is local and from these local functions

729
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,950
is local and from these local functions you'll be able to say

730
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:11,930
you'll be able to say build this this joint distribution of

731
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,569
build this this joint distribution of the menu of the volumes by the way when

732
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:17,420
the menu of the volumes by the way when I said some wearables of here and there

733
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,500
I said some wearables of here and there this is in the special context or in the

734
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,160
this is in the special context or in the time context but the goth can be a very

735
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,440
time context but the goth can be a very abstract entity they have nothing to do

736
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,710
abstract entity they have nothing to do with space of time okay so don't you

737
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:34,099
with space of time okay so don't you know again depending on the type of

738
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:35,839
know again depending on the type of things you're interested you can

739
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,190
things you're interested you can envision different scenarios so Bayesian

740
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,990
envision different scenarios so Bayesian networks are probabilistic graphical

741
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,750
networks are probabilistic graphical models that are defined on directed

742
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,370
models that are defined on directed graphs and I'm gonna show you an example

743
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:49,970
graphs and I'm gonna show you an example shortly and this Markov random pills

744
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:53,540
shortly and this Markov random pills this Markov networks are basically

745
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,490
this Markov networks are basically probabilistic graphical models for

746
00:38:55,490 --> 00:39:00,349
probabilistic graphical models for undirected graphs three so these are the

747
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:03,890
undirected graphs three so these are the main two types right and you can have

748
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:07,640
main two types right and you can have some graphs that have some directed

749
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,760
some graphs that have some directed component some undirected components and

750
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,950
component some undirected components and also you can pose this in sort of some

751
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,220
also you can pose this in sort of some unified way using what's called

752
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,789
unified way using what's called photographs and we will discuss verse as

753
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:20,390
photographs and we will discuss verse as well

754
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,430
well so actually you know three lectures

755
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,620
so actually you know three lectures there's no point of discussion one type

756
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,530
there's no point of discussion one type or another we will unify development for

757
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,000
or another we will unify development for all of this at the same time okay

758
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,470
all of this at the same time okay the nodes in the graph we represent are

759
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,200
the nodes in the graph we represent are the variables and this is very important

760
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,299
the variables and this is very important the lack of transition the graph will

761
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:40,190
the lack of transition the graph will imply conditional independence

762
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,569
imply conditional independence assumptions in other ways if I have

763
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:47,530
assumptions in other ways if I have nodes representing random variables and

764
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,210
nodes representing random variables and I have to take ten variables and I

765
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,549
I have to take ten variables and I connected smart evil with every other

766
00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:54,589
connected smart evil with every other body world then there's no point of

767
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:57,380
body world then there's no point of doing graphs because that problem

768
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,089
doing graphs because that problem complexity will never allow you to go

769
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:00,210
complexity will never allow you to go anyway

770
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:04,540
anyway it's somehow some edges are missing that

771
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,090
it's somehow some edges are missing that implies to military somebody who don't

772
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,590
implies to military somebody who don't depend on all the volume which the lots

773
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:11,590
depend on all the volume which the lots what we need to think about so the idea

774
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,110
what we need to think about so the idea is we are interested in graphs that they

775
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,550
is we are interested in graphs that they are not fully connected right they are

776
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,740
are not fully connected right they are fully connected one of gaining anything

777
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:22,090
fully connected one of gaining anything by learning this course right the idea

778
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,340
by learning this course right the idea is not everything depends on everything

779
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,020
is not everything depends on everything and we need to learn about part of the

780
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,660
and we need to learn about part of the structure problem that we discussed the

781
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,420
structure problem that we discussed the second part of the course but again the

782
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,550
second part of the course but again the lack of threads is what represents

783
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,470
lack of threads is what represents conditional independence assumptions and

784
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,020
conditional independence assumptions and we spend two or three lectures to

785
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,360
we spend two or three lectures to discuss that and I will give you a

786
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,670
discuss that and I will give you a number of formal projects to work on all

787
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,290
number of formal projects to work on all right so something just let's go from

788
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:51,390
right so something just let's go from right in there this is a directed graph

789
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:55,660
right in there this is a directed graph I'm gonna give you the terminology in of

790
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,010
I'm gonna give you the terminology in of the you know in follow up slide but just

791
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:03,910
the you know in follow up slide but just to get things going basically here you

792
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,400
to get things going basically here you can use common sense interpretation for

793
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,140
can use common sense interpretation for now you know so all of this are other

794
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,110
now you know so all of this are other variables we have a b c d e are on two

795
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,240
variables we have a b c d e are on two variables can be continuous or discrete

796
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,240
variables can be continuous or discrete doesn't really matter and the idea here

797
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,980
doesn't really matter and the idea here of the service means that C depends

798
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,600
of the service means that C depends today and B it depends on C and D right

799
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,900
today and B it depends on C and D right and so this implies this direction of

800
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,970
and so this implies this direction of the arrow the causal relationship

801
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:31,600
the arrow the causal relationship alright so big doesn't depend on me it

802
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,820
alright so big doesn't depend on me it depends from D that's what I know from

803
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,050
depends from D that's what I know from here okay

804
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:38,610
here okay the rest you will need to derive from

805
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:42,700
the rest you will need to derive from the factorization employed by this

806
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,890
the factorization employed by this directive model now this one direction

807
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:47,860
directive model now this one direction graph there is no error okay so

808
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,540
graph there is no error okay so obviously if there's no arrows and you

809
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,220
obviously if there's no arrows and you see this connections

810
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,440
see this connections obviously C is related to a a and B

811
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,120
obviously C is related to a a and B obviously she's related to you

812
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,500
obviously she's related to you and to be envied so you serious tricks

813
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,520
and to be envied so you serious tricks there was this interconnected sets of

814
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,180
there was this interconnected sets of notes so both imply really correlations

815
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,370
notes so both imply really correlations but there is no directional component so

816
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:18,200
but there is no directional component so in essence the effect of EMV and BMC has

817
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:23,570
in essence the effect of EMV and BMC has no direction okay so this is very

818
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,950
no direction okay so this is very different from what this chain is drawn

819
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,450
different from what this chain is drawn okay

820
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,840
okay now I'm not going to discuss what this

821
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,010
now I'm not going to discuss what this is in detail right but this is sort of

822
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:36,860
is in detail right but this is sort of another type of graph that will allow us

823
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,250
another type of graph that will allow us to sort of unify those two graphs okay

824
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,610
to sort of unify those two graphs okay and somehow to do that we need to

825
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:46,070
and somehow to do that we need to introduce the sectional squared note but

826
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:49,940
introduce the sectional squared note but effectively explicitly spell out these

827
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,460
effectively explicitly spell out these local functions these local potentials

828
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,760
local functions these local potentials but you have either in this undirected

829
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,310
but you have either in this undirected graphs or in the directed graphs so

830
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,010
graphs or in the directed graphs so these are functional and that's why this

831
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:04,850
these are functional and that's why this is called a photograph okay so this are

832
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,300
is called a photograph okay so this are the random variables and it's a constant

833
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:13,690
the random variables and it's a constant okay and so we would be able to how to

834
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:17,200
okay and so we would be able to how to eventually do inference in factor graphs

835
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,990
eventually do inference in factor graphs and not way accounting for inference

836
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:26,150
and not way accounting for inference both directed and undirected model again

837
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,520
both directed and undirected model again you don't need to know anything any of

838
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,280
you don't need to know anything any of this because we will spent many lectures

839
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,020
this because we will spent many lectures discussing each of this but I thought

840
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:38,110
discussing each of this but I thought you should see this on lecture one so

841
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:41,050
you should see this on lecture one so now is representative of variables edges

842
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,490
now is representative of variables edges dependencies and really what we're

843
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,800
dependencies and really what we're interested is in the lack of the edges

844
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,050
interested is in the lack of the edges so the path but there is no edge between

845
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:51,740
so the path but there is no edge between a and B that's very important if you try

846
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:55,650
a and B that's very important if you try to connect a to B to D to Eve than

847
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,450
to connect a to B to D to Eve than don't expect to gain anything by doing

848
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:02,670
don't expect to gain anything by doing graph theoretic approach okay

849
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:07,080
graph theoretic approach okay so in if you have many nodes so this is

850
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,060
so in if you have many nodes so this is the trek high-dimensional this village h

851
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,570
the trek high-dimensional this village h 100 the first objective when you work

852
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:17,910
100 the first objective when you work with graphs is to come up with the joint

853
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:19,830
with graphs is to come up with the joint probability distribution and in

854
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,740
probability distribution and in particularly with the factorized form of

855
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,170
particularly with the factorized form of the joint probability distribution okay

856
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:28,680
the joint probability distribution okay the fact is form that somehow can easily

857
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,800
the fact is form that somehow can easily be visualized in a graph accounting for

858
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,230
be visualized in a graph accounting for whatever independence relations exist

859
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:40,200
whatever independence relations exist between these values now you can

860
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,630
between these values now you can appreciate that if the variables

861
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,340
appreciate that if the variables dependent there is no independence

862
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,170
dependent there is no independence relations right and each of these

863
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:49,890
relations right and each of these variables can take K values and let's

864
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,930
variables can take K values and let's say each of these columns is also

865
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:55,770
say each of these columns is also discrete and can take K values how many

866
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,530
discrete and can take K values how many values how much information you need to

867
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,680
values how much information you need to describe this probability distribution

868
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,240
describe this probability distribution so you need K values for each of them

869
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,740
so you need K values for each of them and you have via block how many

870
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,660
and you have via block how many variables Divinity's try to describe

871
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,940
variables Divinity's try to describe this joint distribution

872
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:20,150
this joint distribution with no independence relations at all

873
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:20,160


874
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,950
take away the power

875
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:23,960


876
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,809
the power B right so it least 10 forget about you won't be able to do anything

877
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:34,089
about you won't be able to do anything okay so we will see on what we can

878
00:45:34,089 --> 00:45:36,010
okay so we will see on what we can benefit take and run up to this

879
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:39,370
benefit take and run up to this condition in the ventilation and drop

880
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:43,450
condition in the ventilation and drop now once somehow you can come up with

881
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:46,180
now once somehow you can come up with the proper authorization of this then

882
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,710
the proper authorization of this then you can stop talking about the inference

883
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:51,640
you can stop talking about the inference so for example if you let's say measure

884
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,620
so for example if you let's say measure the value of variable X 1 you have you

885
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,720
the value of variable X 1 you have you know what the value is then you can stay

886
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,089
know what the value is then you can stay with the value of x 2 given X 1 where

887
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,829
with the value of x 2 given X 1 where the rest of the variables maybe you want

888
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:02,910
the rest of the variables maybe you want analyze them ok to get rid of them

889
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:08,740
analyze them ok to get rid of them so obviously you appreciate that the sum

890
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,260
so obviously you appreciate that the sum and product rule will come candy to

891
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,109
and product rule will come candy to actually manipulate this but also Bayes

892
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:16,539
actually manipulate this but also Bayes rule would be essential when you have

893
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:22,799
rule would be essential when you have evidence to be able to do inference

894
00:46:22,799 --> 00:46:22,809


895
00:46:22,809 --> 00:46:31,569
applications really you know you just mentioned any anything right

896
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:35,109
mentioned any anything right so in diaphragmatic this standard

897
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:39,450
so in diaphragmatic this standard methods in in medical diagnosis actually

898
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:45,160
methods in in medical diagnosis actually almost every you know diagnosis now

899
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,839
almost every you know diagnosis now actually every time I am reading

900
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:49,980
actually every time I am reading articles but visual to make the systems

901
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,260
articles but visual to make the systems for diagnosing diseases would take from

902
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:57,069
for diagnosing diseases would take from images etc they operate with much less

903
00:46:57,069 --> 00:47:01,420
images etc they operate with much less chance for false alarms than the best

904
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,430
chance for false alarms than the best doctor in the world right they're

905
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,859
doctor in the world right they're extremely accurate so now it's not like

906
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:09,010
extremely accurate so now it's not like this is for mathematicians or computer

907
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:11,049
this is for mathematicians or computer scientists people in practice are

908
00:47:11,049 --> 00:47:14,440
scientists people in practice are actually using probably splatter model

909
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,070
actually using probably splatter model for prognosis all the

910
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:20,820
for prognosis all the loss of diseases computer vision speech

911
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:24,570
loss of diseases computer vision speech recognition Google Translate I mean I

912
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:26,580
recognition Google Translate I mean I use it you know when I go to China I

913
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,400
use it you know when I go to China I always say something and it translates

914
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,100
always say something and it translates and I always see what it translates to

915
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,080
and I always see what it translates to be sure it was laced correctly because

916
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,960
be sure it was laced correctly because sometimes I say something and I read

917
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,470
sometimes I say something and I read this like wow I'm gonna get in trouble

918
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:48,980
this like wow I'm gonna get in trouble and so it really works very well okay I

919
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,840
and so it really works very well okay I mean I have seen it even working when

920
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,980
mean I have seen it even working when there are several people speaking

921
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,920
there are several people speaking simultaneously with action and it does

922
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,500
simultaneously with action and it does miracles so it's really a director

923
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,940
miracles so it's really a director filtration of republished graphical

924
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,410
filtration of republished graphical models practically every topic of the

925
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:07,310
models practically every topic of the algorithm machine learning can be posed

926
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:11,940
algorithm machine learning can be posed on probabilistic graphical models for

927
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,000
on probabilistic graphical models for okay so we may I don't know if we have

928
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,420
okay so we may I don't know if we have time I covered it with ideas of blatant

929
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,790
time I covered it with ideas of blatant holy Moses model reduction in the fall

930
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:24,420
holy Moses model reduction in the fall so misspent electrocuted go back and

931
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,970
so misspent electrocuted go back and address the ocean generalize them using

932
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,830
address the ocean generalize them using graphical model so if you don't know

933
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,480
graphical model so if you don't know anything about what solvent is fine

934
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,270
anything about what solvent is fine because when we post them in graphic we

935
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:35,430
because when we post them in graphic we will post them as new problems and so

936
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:39,150
will post them as new problems and so you will see sort of a modern aspect of

937
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:43,200
you will see sort of a modern aspect of this algorithm and and I think you know

938
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,440
this algorithm and and I think you know you like of more than a questions that

939
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:52,080
you like of more than a questions that without the means to visualizer the you

940
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,830
without the means to visualizer the you know error control codes and the way you

941
00:48:55,830 --> 00:49:00,390
know error control codes and the way you know your computer you know restart and

942
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:03,480
know your computer you know restart and figure out what goes wrong right and and

943
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,350
figure out what goes wrong right and and became properly it's really based in in

944
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:13,050
became properly it's really based in in probabilistic graphical models if you

945
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,120
probabilistic graphical models if you take for most in engineering to take

946
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,320
take for most in engineering to take sort of

947
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,540
sort of you know we talked about little to

948
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,030
you know we talked about little to undividable scanner there but actually

949
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:24,520
undividable scanner there but actually the source of this adapter ones can be

950
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,770
the source of this adapter ones can be extremely effective for this knowledge

951
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:30,280
extremely effective for this knowledge they're not simply random variables but

952
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,160
they're not simply random variables but the interconnected complicated systems

953
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,800
the interconnected complicated systems of differing ology and mechanical model

954
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,230
of differing ology and mechanical model the thermal model etc and each of them

955
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:42,340
the thermal model etc and each of them has its own random by the Wilson within

956
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,670
has its own random by the Wilson within right but you have interconnected

957
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:46,960
right but you have interconnected systems that speak to each other and

958
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,310
systems that speak to each other and this is really sort of an important area

959
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:53,800
this is really sort of an important area for development because it points a lot

960
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,300
for development because it points a lot of tolerances because a lot of these

961
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,800
of tolerances because a lot of these systems are governed by models that are

962
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:05,860
systems are governed by models that are very compassionate very expensive so so

963
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,660
very compassionate very expensive so so a lot of the methodologies for doing

964
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:12,100
a lot of the methodologies for doing inference would not be able to sort of

965
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,900
inference would not be able to sort of what directly you would have to do

966
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,160
what directly you would have to do something there to simplify the

967
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,400
something there to simplify the representation of these systems okay so

968
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,350
representation of these systems okay so let's you know go fast through the

969
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:30,850
let's you know go fast through the patient knowledge of the variables exist

970
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:35,980
patient knowledge of the variables exist already said for publicity Lester the

971
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:39,280
already said for publicity Lester the lock opens it basically will provide

972
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,980
lock opens it basically will provide information on independence relations so

973
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,040
information on independence relations so graft has a number of nodes as a number

974
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,800
graft has a number of nodes as a number of edges the number of nodes from want

975
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,890
of edges the number of nodes from want to be the number of edges if we have a

976
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:59,530
to be the number of edges if we have a directed graph basically would be this

977
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:04,150
directed graph basically would be this pair s comma T where the else goes from

978
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,980
pair s comma T where the else goes from the you know the arrow goes convexity

979
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:11,980
the you know the arrow goes convexity okay now to really you know extend this

980
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,960
okay now to really you know extend this the bottom directed and directed graphs

981
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,070
the bottom directed and directed graphs you have to use what's called an

982
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:18,790
you have to use what's called an adjacency matrix so if you define the

983
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:22,000
adjacency matrix so if you define the adjacency matrix

984
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,010


985
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:32,380
GF S&amp;P little notes equals one if the ads s comma T is in this set all right

986
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,380
ads s comma T is in this set all right and this allows you to extend this to

987
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:38,500
and this allows you to extend this to undirected graphs because if you have G

988
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:43,150
undirected graphs because if you have G of s comma T equal 12 and simultaneous

989
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,580
of s comma T equal 12 and simultaneous in G of T comma X equal to 1 right then

990
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,359
in G of T comma X equal to 1 right then this is an undirected graph there is no

991
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:51,099
this is an undirected graph there is no going from s to T and T 2 s is the same

992
00:51:51,099 --> 00:51:56,590
going from s to T and T 2 s is the same okay so two examples and I threw a lot

993
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:59,230
okay so two examples and I threw a lot so far terminology here that's going to

994
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:01,030
so far terminology here that's going to come in the following slides but it

995
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,400
come in the following slides but it helps to see them several times so you

996
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,570
helps to see them several times so you have note one two three four five I am

997
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:10,900
have note one two three four five I am going to call note one the road all

998
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,720
going to call note one the road all right can you give me without rocks or

999
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,270
right can you give me without rocks or even reading the pull up slides just

1000
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:19,150
even reading the pull up slides just look on the graph what do you think the

1001
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:20,800
look on the graph what do you think the route will be I mean wouldn't be a good

1002
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,700
route will be I mean wouldn't be a good this mixture

1003
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,390
this mixture I mean you notice okay there is from you

1004
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:33,430
I mean you notice okay there is from you know so so in other ways why you know

1005
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:37,420
know so so in other ways why you know the route is of five and it's one what

1006
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:44,579
the route is of five and it's one what will be a good definition

1007
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:44,589


1008
00:52:44,589 --> 00:52:53,160
right so so so I am repeating the answer here in this case one has not lost

1009
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,420
here in this case one has not lost coming to it okay and as we will see

1010
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,339
coming to it okay and as we will see this implies following in definitions

1011
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:01,670
this implies following in definitions when I come up with one has no father

1012
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:02,849
when I come up with one has no father okay

1013
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:06,989
okay and with a definition five them that is

1014
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:11,689
and with a definition five them that is the nature of the graph five has no

1015
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:12,929
the nature of the graph five has no children

1016
00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:19,679
children okay so five has not simply sent one is

1017
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:25,249
okay so five has not simply sent one is the ornament of - all right and three

1018
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:28,949
the ornament of - all right and three you know here you know 40s - power is

1019
00:53:28,949 --> 00:53:29,670
you know here you know 40s - power is two and three

1020
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:34,499
two and three okay etc and to achieve what else to

1021
00:53:34,499 --> 00:53:36,499
okay etc and to achieve what else to come together is important and it phase

1022
00:53:36,499 --> 00:53:39,599
come together is important and it phase again this is coming up later but I want

1023
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,939
again this is coming up later but I want you to see hundreds of times so we can

1024
00:53:41,939 --> 00:53:47,689
you to see hundreds of times so we can communicate it says this directed a

1025
00:53:47,689 --> 00:53:52,439
communicate it says this directed a means it has no cycles of a cyclic graph

1026
00:53:52,439 --> 00:53:53,969
means it has no cycles of a cyclic graph all right

1027
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:58,130
all right you noticed has no better it has no

1028
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:01,890
you noticed has no better it has no cycles someone would say this is a cycle

1029
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:03,719
cycles someone would say this is a cycle but actually because this is the

1030
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:06,689
but actually because this is the electric graph you notice when I go the

1031
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:09,329
electric graph you notice when I go the direction of the arrows here I cannot go

1032
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,229
direction of the arrows here I cannot go from four to three

1033
00:54:10,229 --> 00:54:14,549
from four to three so there are no cycles them okay

1034
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:16,859
so there are no cycles them okay alright so we discussed this and then it

1035
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:18,390
alright so we discussed this and then it says the notes are number in topological

1036
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:21,870
says the notes are number in topological order so what does not mean looks very

1037
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:24,630
order so what does not mean looks very sensual for the left graph what do we

1038
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,029
sensual for the left graph what do we mean - political order just looking at

1039
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:28,829
mean - political order just looking at this graph basically what will be sort

1040
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:34,229
this graph basically what will be sort of your imagination share with us so the

1041
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:50,930
of your imagination share with us so the numbering change in topological order so

1042
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:50,940


1043
00:54:50,940 --> 00:55:09,680
I mean complain I have always one two three four five

1044
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:09,690


1045
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:15,410
all right the tradition hearing bit right which since we define the route to

1046
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:17,690
right which since we define the route to be the note that has no parents all

1047
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:22,370
be the note that has no parents all right so basically we have to start

1048
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:26,779
right so basically we have to start numbering from the root to the leaves

1049
00:55:26,779 --> 00:55:30,289
numbering from the root to the leaves basically okay and that's a topological

1050
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:34,250
basically okay and that's a topological order not to more complicated God you

1051
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:36,339
order not to more complicated God you know this may not be a unique

1052
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:41,779
know this may not be a unique topological order all right but you

1053
00:55:41,779 --> 00:55:45,200
topological order all right but you start majestically you are not going to

1054
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,770
start majestically you are not going to assign to the chain to the children

1055
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:53,539
assign to the chain to the children notice that they're in the order of

1056
00:55:53,539 --> 00:55:57,740
notice that they're in the order of numbering on the part right number the

1057
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,410
numbering on the part right number the parents and the children that's the idea

1058
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:01,150
parents and the children that's the idea here

1059
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:05,960
here okay so 2 &amp; 3 are the children so 1 will

1060
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,640
okay so 2 &amp; 3 are the children so 1 will be there to enter it will be there

1061
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,010
be there to enter it will be there similarly these are the parents of

1062
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:13,190
similarly these are the parents of course draw the numbering of topological

1063
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:16,760
course draw the numbering of topological order makes sense ok the same graph now

1064
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:23,240
order makes sense ok the same graph now if it was an undirected graph okay

1065
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,910
if it was an undirected graph okay these I'm pouring and lots of things

1066
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:28,190
these I'm pouring and lots of things because you know I want you to see those

1067
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:28,579
because you know I want you to see those things

1068
00:56:28,579 --> 00:56:32,900
things hundreds of times and I'm details that

1069
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,730
hundreds of times and I'm details that are going to be discussed with lots of

1070
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:37,160
are going to be discussed with lots of simple examples in coop lectures right

1071
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,910
simple examples in coop lectures right but I want you to see these things now

1072
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:43,220
but I want you to see these things now so in some sense I'm claiming that the

1073
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:46,279
so in some sense I'm claiming that the gallop you see here it is very much the

1074
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:48,500
gallop you see here it is very much the same as that job but they see there is

1075
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,150
same as that job but they see there is something going on that's a little bit

1076
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:52,339
something going on that's a little bit different what's the difference between

1077
00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:53,809
different what's the difference between the two block when you look at them okay

1078
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:56,000
the two block when you look at them okay there are no arrows but there is

1079
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,260
there are no arrows but there is something else that is different so what

1080
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,660
something else that is different so what is definitely when you visually look at

1081
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:07,710
is definitely when you visually look at this two and three are connected

1082
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:10,620
this two and three are connected and that's an essential step when you go

1083
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:13,430
and that's an essential step when you go from directly drafts from directed so

1084
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:18,990
from directly drafts from directed so what are the two and three note what is

1085
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:21,780
what are the two and three note what is common between two and three their

1086
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:30,530
common between two and three their parent just know the

1087
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:30,540


1088
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:37,880
their points of what of power so when you went from a directed graph to UM

1089
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,280
you went from a directed graph to UM directive what you need to do is you

1090
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,770
directive what you need to do is you need to be sure the parents are married

1091
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:46,330
need to be sure the parents are married because this is not today we don't allow

1092
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:51,050
because this is not today we don't allow Mary power okay so we marry them all

1093
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,420
Mary power okay so we marry them all right and this process methodical is

1094
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,900
right and this process methodical is called a modernization process okay

1095
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:00,200
called a modernization process okay people who think that I'm you know my

1096
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,820
people who think that I'm you know my let you guess religious connotations but

1097
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,820
let you guess religious connotations but that's the terminology moralization

1098
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,650
that's the terminology moralization okay so you basically have to marry the

1099
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,730
okay so you basically have to marry the parents okay

1100
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:10,010
parents okay and actually immediately you can see

1101
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,840
and actually immediately you can see when you marry the parents you get moved

1102
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,340
when you marry the parents you get moved in this graph

1103
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:16,430
in this graph okay so suddenly you went from no loops

1104
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:20,510
okay so suddenly you went from no loops to two loops right and and obvious

1105
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:22,520
to two loops right and and obvious implications in the way we're going to

1106
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:27,020
implications in the way we're going to treat this process now in the graphs

1107
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:29,360
treat this process now in the graphs once you moralize you marry the parts

1108
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,940
once you moralize you marry the parts two and three we define what this whole

1109
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,820
two and three we define what this whole page and if particularly of interest

1110
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,140
page and if particularly of interest here is what is called maximal cliques

1111
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:44,210
here is what is called maximal cliques okay so click is a set of interconnected

1112
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:48,880
okay so click is a set of interconnected no okay so for example if you this is

1113
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,550
no okay so for example if you this is one two or three is a clique right

1114
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:54,530
one two or three is a clique right because one is connected to one squared

1115
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,900
because one is connected to one squared - 3 + 2 is correct - 3 all the nodes are

1116
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:01,520
- 3 + 2 is correct - 3 all the nodes are connected now you say is 1 2 3 and

1117
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:07,140
connected now you say is 1 2 3 and privately why not

1118
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,750
privately why not one employee without connected right 2 +

1119
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:15,870
one employee without connected right 2 + 5 3 &amp; 5 are not correct ok so 1 2 &amp; 3 2

1120
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:19,440
5 3 &amp; 5 are not correct ok so 1 2 &amp; 3 2 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 of what they call we

1121
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,170
3 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 of what they call we called maxima please

1122
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:25,290
called maxima please and I can tell you and this will come in

1123
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:29,160
and I can tell you and this will come in four five lectures I don't know the idea

1124
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,080
four five lectures I don't know the idea of identifying this parchment which will

1125
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,590
of identifying this parchment which will be but when we take a joint probability

1126
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:36,330
be but when we take a joint probability distribution of this paragraph around

1127
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:38,100
distribution of this paragraph around the variables we're going to be able to

1128
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,650
the variables we're going to be able to write the joint distribution as the

1129
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:43,620
write the joint distribution as the product of potentials is with this

1130
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,750
product of potentials is with this potential behind on our table please

1131
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,730
potential behind on our table please so the local potentials what its

1132
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:50,610
so the local potentials what its potential would be on automatically and

1133
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:51,630
potential would be on automatically and that would be actually an amazing

1134
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,910
that would be actually an amazing theorem which we are going to prove

1135
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:56,850
theorem which we are going to prove right but somehow if you have a graph

1136
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:58,250
right but somehow if you have a graph like that and a probability distribution

1137
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:01,380
like that and a probability distribution defined on this graph then that you can

1138
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,510
defined on this graph then that you can decompose it on potentials defined over

1139
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:07,220
decompose it on potentials defined over this box conflicts okay

1140
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:12,000
this box conflicts okay again think of this as start from the

1141
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,700
again think of this as start from the air ideas because we will discuss those

1142
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:20,400
air ideas because we will discuss those as we go in underneath a course okay so

1143
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,420
as we go in underneath a course okay so let's see the parents of a node all

1144
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:28,620
let's see the parents of a node all right you remember the conduit defining

1145
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,150
right you remember the conduit defining what was the name of G this is the

1146
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:33,090
what was the name of G this is the adjacency matrix so the parent of a node

1147
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:36,150
adjacency matrix so the parent of a node s are all the node equal G of T comma s

1148
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:38,550
s are all the node equal G of T comma s is equal to R so for example the parent

1149
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:43,370
is equal to R so for example the parent of non-stick are two and five okay and

1150
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:46,620
of non-stick are two and five okay and you can denote this as five six equal to

1151
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:51,300
you can denote this as five six equal to point 5 or X 5 6 you know different

1152
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:54,990
point 5 or X 5 6 you know different notations I think this is participating

1153
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:59,540
notations I think this is participating both notations are the ones used by

1154
01:00:59,540 --> 01:00:59,550


1155
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:10,190
the Michael Jordan stuff the two dates of no vest are basically the notes leaf

1156
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:14,900
of no vest are basically the notes leaf touch of Geo Testament equal to one the

1157
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:18,920
touch of Geo Testament equal to one the climbing of an old alright is best and

1158
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,500
climbing of an old alright is best and the pairing suppressed and so I actually

1159
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,860
the pairing suppressed and so I actually what I was looking is like you know why

1160
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:26,900
what I was looking is like you know why they don't like the children all right

1161
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,150
they don't like the children all right but somehow that's why maybe I never use

1162
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:33,230
but somehow that's why maybe I never use the terminology commonly but until we

1163
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:34,910
the terminology commonly but until we find that this is not right in

1164
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:37,130
find that this is not right in definition this is what it is there so

1165
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:40,300
definition this is what it is there so the family is asked and the parts of us

1166
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,950
the family is asked and the parts of us we already discussed route least the

1167
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:45,260
we already discussed route least the knows no parents to leave the know dot

1168
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:51,920
knows no parents to leave the know dot children the ancestors of an LP are all

1169
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,280
children the ancestors of an LP are all the notes s where there is a path from s

1170
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,400
the notes s where there is a path from s to T and equal to directed graph this

1171
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,790
to T and equal to directed graph this path has to be a directed path if some

1172
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:06,110
path has to be a directed path if some directed basically any path from s to T

1173
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:08,780
directed basically any path from s to T will do it and the descendants of an

1174
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:13,910
will do it and the descendants of an arrest are all the nodes right but you

1175
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:18,080
arrest are all the nodes right but you can find the trail from s to T and again

1176
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,060
can find the trail from s to T and again in the ref graphs this trail we have to

1177
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:23,120
in the ref graphs this trail we have to follow the arrow so these are the

1178
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,690
follow the arrow so these are the ancestors and goes to the central the

1179
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:29,020
ancestors and goes to the central the [Applause]

1180
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,370
[Applause] neighborhoods and it doesn't matter what

1181
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:34,820
neighborhoods and it doesn't matter what I will graph we have the immediately

1182
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:40,190
I will graph we have the immediately corrected note so the neighbors of s all

1183
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:44,780
corrected note so the neighbors of s all the taste provided 0% equal to one of G

1184
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,880
the taste provided 0% equal to one of G of T of s equal to one

1185
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,600
of T of s equal to one okay so in defining the neighbors given

1186
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,700
okay so in defining the neighbors given even if it's a directed graph the

1187
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,230
even if it's a directed graph the orientation

1188
01:02:54,230 --> 01:03:00,170
orientation it's not important so the degree of a

1189
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:01,670
it's not important so the degree of a node is the number of neighbors and in

1190
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:03,079
node is the number of neighbors and in particular you would see this and lots

1191
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:05,240
particular you would see this and lots of Muslim leavening books the in-and-out

1192
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,849
of Muslim leavening books the in-and-out degrees basically count the number of

1193
01:03:07,849 --> 01:03:10,789
degrees basically count the number of parents and the number of children so

1194
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:13,250
parents and the number of children so when they say the in degrees the number

1195
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:17,299
when they say the in degrees the number of parents they are degrees the number

1196
01:03:17,299 --> 01:03:19,789
of parents they are degrees the number of children and this is sort of an

1197
01:03:19,789 --> 01:03:23,390
of children and this is sort of an important concept because when we write

1198
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:25,190
important concept because when we write the joint probability distribution we

1199
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:28,279
the joint probability distribution we would see the factorization will still

1200
01:03:28,279 --> 01:03:33,079
would see the factorization will still basically with this in degrees with a

1201
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:34,640
basically with this in degrees with a number of parents retaining I may

1202
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:39,609
number of parents retaining I may actually show you in the slide shortly

1203
01:03:39,609 --> 01:03:42,200
actually show you in the slide shortly we already discuss the concept of a

1204
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,339
we already discuss the concept of a directed cycle alright so in this

1205
01:03:46,339 --> 01:03:48,920
directed cycle alright so in this diagram here there is no directed cycle

1206
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,640
diagram here there is no directed cycle but you notice from this this one okay

1207
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:55,460
but you notice from this this one okay on this there is no directed cycle all

1208
01:03:55,460 --> 01:04:00,140
on this there is no directed cycle all right so a directed Pacific Loft is a

1209
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,450
right so a directed Pacific Loft is a directed graph with non directed cycles

1210
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:04,900
directed graph with non directed cycles okay

1211
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,790
okay and most of the graphs we are going to

1212
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:09,220
and most of the graphs we are going to use will be direct the strictly graphs

1213
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,400
use will be direct the strictly graphs but you know when we generalized we will

1214
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:19,540
but you know when we generalized we will be able to go away without okay this

1215
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,850
be able to go away without okay this principle the three and the direct entry

1216
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:24,730
principle the three and the direct entry is very essential because algorithms on

1217
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:28,030
is very essential because algorithms on three are they just implement all right

1218
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:33,250
three are they just implement all right and you know we wish that every graph

1219
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:36,610
and you know we wish that every graph was a three because if it's a three we

1220
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:40,840
was a three because if it's a three we can do inference in second so this total

1221
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:45,360
can do inference in second so this total would be an ideal situation so an

1222
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:48,610
would be an ideal situation so an undirected three is an undirected graph

1223
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:53,380
undirected three is an undirected graph with no cycles all right and for an

1224
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:55,570
with no cycles all right and for an undirected tree there is a single path

1225
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:59,760
undirected tree there is a single path between any pair of nodes okay

1226
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,320
between any pair of nodes okay and I'm starting with this right because

1227
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,330
and I'm starting with this right because I would be to be able to define this

1228
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:07,180
I would be to be able to define this concept of 23 for directed graphs and

1229
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:09,490
concept of 23 for directed graphs and with an internal directory strain on

1230
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:12,640
with an internal directory strain on directory is an undirected graph with no

1231
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:17,260
directory is an undirected graph with no cycles okay so for example did we have

1232
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:24,280
cycles okay so for example did we have an undirected three stomach work without

1233
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,200
an undirected three stomach work without cycles here so this is not good then we

1234
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,900
cycles here so this is not good then we have reading picture anyway specimen and

1235
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,450
have reading picture anyway specimen and don't see it and maybe we'll want to

1236
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:36,730
don't see it and maybe we'll want to come alright for our way so you know

1237
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:39,730
come alright for our way so you know directory has no cycles so there is a

1238
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:41,950
directory has no cycles so there is a single path from any pair of nodes now a

1239
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:47,460
single path from any pair of nodes now a directed three is a directed three is a

1240
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:50,860
directed three is a directed three is a directed a strictly graph in which every

1241
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:54,850
directed a strictly graph in which every node has at most one Parliament can we

1242
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:59,170
node has at most one Parliament can we tell me why do we want one parent and

1243
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:01,510
tell me why do we want one parent and how is that going to be connected with

1244
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:03,070
how is that going to be connected with the modernization process that I

1245
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:03,589
the modernization process that I mentioned

1246
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:06,769
mentioned for it says the director 3 is a dog in

1247
01:06:06,769 --> 01:06:11,299
for it says the director 3 is a dog in which every notice at most one part you

1248
01:06:11,299 --> 01:06:14,380
which every notice at most one part you never are certified for there this

1249
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,509
never are certified for there this equivalency of a directive three-wheeler

1250
01:06:17,509 --> 01:06:20,599
equivalency of a directive three-wheeler on directly after we did some operations

1251
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:23,299
on directly after we did some operations which we called moralization success a

1252
01:06:23,299 --> 01:06:27,410
which we called moralization success a directory is a dog in which every notice

1253
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:32,690
directory is a dog in which every notice of Western palate so why the authorities

1254
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:34,700
of Western palate so why the authorities think has one polished because it has

1255
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,440
think has one polished because it has two polished then what is going to

1256
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:40,370
two polished then what is going to happen when we transform it to know

1257
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:42,049
happen when we transform it to know directly graph we will marry those

1258
01:06:42,049 --> 01:06:44,150
directly graph we will marry those parents and as a result we will get the

1259
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:52,609
parents and as a result we will get the site right so in directed three needs to

1260
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:55,460
site right so in directed three needs to care everyone has at most one part okay

1261
01:06:55,460 --> 01:07:01,279
care everyone has at most one part okay now so this will be ideal situations

1262
01:07:01,279 --> 01:07:03,799
now so this will be ideal situations right to have enough directly or the

1263
01:07:03,799 --> 01:07:08,209
right to have enough directly or the direction three now if we have directed

1264
01:07:08,209 --> 01:07:10,430
direction three now if we have directed a strictly graphical just one on one

1265
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:13,789
a strictly graphical just one on one parent right and we mobilize it

1266
01:07:13,789 --> 01:07:18,829
parent right and we mobilize it effectively we will get you know we get

1267
01:07:18,829 --> 01:07:25,099
effectively we will get you know we get cycles but if the undirected glass that

1268
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:27,499
cycles but if the undirected glass that we get is a tree all right then we can

1269
01:07:27,499 --> 01:07:29,989
we get is a tree all right then we can call this the recognizer for the pony

1270
01:07:29,989 --> 01:07:34,549
call this the recognizer for the pony tree okay so let's see some examples

1271
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:37,940
tree okay so let's see some examples here

1272
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:37,950


1273
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:42,050
can you tell me which one this graphs is a train which to one is a poly-tree or

1274
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:46,660
a train which to one is a poly-tree or you know what is this car is this Satori

1275
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:50,920
you know what is this car is this Satori they're coming to our definition right

1276
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:54,290
they're coming to our definition right over there ft3 is very very noxious of

1277
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:56,300
over there ft3 is very very noxious of most one pilot does this loop to be like

1278
01:07:56,300 --> 01:08:00,320
most one pilot does this loop to be like a tree right so this actually transform

1279
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,210
a tree right so this actually transform in eastern undirected graph right there

1280
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:06,890
in eastern undirected graph right there will be no novelization of step so the

1281
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:09,080
will be no novelization of step so the interconnect is not in that because you

1282
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,670
interconnect is not in that because you know this just this is the part that has

1283
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,380
know this just this is the part that has happened father

1284
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:15,620
happened father so you have every not just one part so

1285
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,789
so you have every not just one part so there would be a single platform

1286
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:19,370
there would be a single platform everybody know to any other node so this

1287
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:24,620
everybody know to any other node so this 2 3 now why is this a 33 it looks like

1288
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:27,070
2 3 now why is this a 33 it looks like in a simple tree but actually it's a 43

1289
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:32,599
in a simple tree but actually it's a 43 the reason is what this night has how

1290
01:08:32,599 --> 01:08:35,990
the reason is what this night has how many product is 2 so when you merge them

1291
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:37,490
many product is 2 so when you merge them all right

1292
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:38,930
all right and you make this an undirected graph

1293
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:40,640
and you make this an undirected graph yes there is a single path from every

1294
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,470
yes there is a single path from every node to any other node but there is a

1295
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:45,940
node to any other node but there is a cycle there ok

1296
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:49,190
cycle there ok now obviously you know the algorithms

1297
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:52,430
now obviously you know the algorithms will get a bit more complicated when you

1298
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,150
will get a bit more complicated when you have a poly-tree

1299
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:57,650
have a poly-tree but actually when you transform this to

1300
01:08:57,650 --> 01:09:00,770
but actually when you transform this to the third form of graph that I call it

1301
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:03,320
the third form of graph that I call it the pasta graph but you will see that

1302
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,110
the pasta graph but you will see that you can treat the 23 basically a penny

1303
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:08,420
you can treat the 23 basically a penny tree will become actually there at 3

1304
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:10,910
tree will become actually there at 3 okay and then you can apply the standard

1305
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:13,520
okay and then you can apply the standard algorithm so we've seen this cost okay

1306
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:18,050
algorithm so we've seen this cost okay but you need to change the grade the the

1307
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:21,200
but you need to change the grade the the graph is the quad so now think this

1308
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,660
graph is the quad so now think this would be a fantastic for graphs look

1309
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:27,770
would be a fantastic for graphs look like that this will also be fantastic so

1310
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:30,170
like that this will also be fantastic so it is more complicated but somehow we

1311
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:35,090
it is more complicated but somehow we will be able to do you know develop

1312
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:36,530
will be able to do you know develop algorithms that they have the same

1313
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:39,149
algorithms that they have the same complex this it will work

1314
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:41,649
complex this it will work okay so this is basically the same thing

1315
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:45,789
okay so this is basically the same thing we just discussed and the same thing

1316
01:09:45,789 --> 01:09:48,970
we just discussed and the same thing here so we talked about cliques and

1317
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:52,209
here so we talked about cliques and maximal cliques so there is this

1318
01:09:52,209 --> 01:09:53,979
maximal cliques so there is this constant of a clique is only defined for

1319
01:09:53,979 --> 01:09:58,750
constant of a clique is only defined for undirected graphs and again a much more

1320
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:03,340
undirected graphs and again a much more clique is the the highest number of

1321
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,919
clique is the the highest number of interconnected nodes and highest number

1322
01:10:05,919 --> 01:10:07,930
interconnected nodes and highest number means you cannot go and consider adding

1323
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:10,510
means you cannot go and consider adding another no to the clique without

1324
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:13,870
another no to the clique without violating the property okay so this

1325
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:18,640
violating the property okay so this would be an essential development sir

1326
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:22,240
would be an essential development sir charies a directed graph when you

1327
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,580
charies a directed graph when you mobilize this to make it an undirected

1328
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:29,939
mobilize this to make it an undirected graph that looks like up okay so what

1329
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:34,450
graph that looks like up okay so what what parents if I married here 2 &amp; 3

1330
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:38,229
what parents if I married here 2 &amp; 3 right 5 this pillow and that C 7 has how

1331
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:44,410
right 5 this pillow and that C 7 has how many parents has 3 votes right how's the

1332
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:47,470
many parents has 3 votes right how's the post will have three parts well there's

1333
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:51,580
post will have three parts well there's some religion is allowed okay so we

1334
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:56,550
some religion is allowed okay so we marry for a 5 pollen sticks okay so

1335
01:10:56,550 --> 01:11:02,080
marry for a 5 pollen sticks okay so alright and again you know I'm trying

1336
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:06,399
alright and again you know I'm trying this just to treat from now but yeah

1337
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:07,990
this just to treat from now but yeah we're going to discuss this in details

1338
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:10,330
we're going to discuss this in details right so you know just remember what

1339
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:12,129
right so you know just remember what this process of organization means and

1340
01:11:12,129 --> 01:11:14,649
this process of organization means and somehow we haven't proved the district

1341
01:11:14,649 --> 01:11:16,810
somehow we haven't proved the district we will into this and whatever you know

1342
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:18,609
we will into this and whatever you know how many I said well equivalent means

1343
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:22,419
how many I said well equivalent means right so we will see when we discussed

1344
01:11:22,419 --> 01:11:26,320
right so we will see when we discussed about optimization of the joint

1345
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,530
about optimization of the joint probability distribution

1346
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:32,840
probability distribution - gross alright so highways the goal

1347
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:37,070
- gross alright so highways the goal right so let me give you without any

1348
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:38,600
right so let me give you without any prints or anything like that okay

1349
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,700
prints or anything like that okay because we will come back to this I

1350
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:43,280
because we will come back to this I would join probably distribution of this

1351
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,790
would join probably distribution of this seven variables is they compose based on

1352
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:49,250
seven variables is they compose based on the graph that you see okay so the

1353
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:52,070
the graph that you see okay so the notation next one to seven means this is

1354
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:54,310
notation next one to seven means this is the joint probability electronic Stewart

1355
01:11:54,310 --> 01:12:00,560
the joint probability electronic Stewart seven and now if we have a graph right

1356
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,550
seven and now if we have a graph right and somebody gives you the the you know

1357
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:08,870
and somebody gives you the the you know P effects want to at seven the theory

1358
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,730
P effects want to at seven the theory tells you what's the what is going to be

1359
01:12:10,730 --> 01:12:11,720
tells you what's the what is going to be the right hand side

1360
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:14,690
the right hand side I mean without looking at this right so

1361
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:16,010
I mean without looking at this right so you don't look at this what is to

1362
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:18,200
you don't look at this what is to improve ability relates to join of

1363
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,780
improve ability relates to join of variables of the two effects one touch

1364
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:24,800
variables of the two effects one touch seven varieties will be north x one

1365
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,470
seven varieties will be north x one times what the effect is even worth

1366
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:35,180
times what the effect is even worth after and and p53 given x1 x2 etc now if

1367
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:37,190
after and and p53 given x1 x2 etc now if you notice general claiming well it's

1368
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:38,990
you notice general claiming well it's actually much simpler that states P of

1369
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:42,380
actually much simpler that states P of x1 times P of x2 given X 1 P of X 3

1370
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:45,890
x1 times P of x2 given X 1 P of X 3 given X 1 P notice that in the worst

1371
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:47,840
given X 1 P notice that in the worst case there are like three arguments in

1372
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,930
case there are like three arguments in the condition can look at the graph to

1373
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:55,100
the condition can look at the graph to look at this equation and tells me again

1374
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,470
look at this equation and tells me again I'm feeling nothing like I'm spying is

1375
01:12:57,470 --> 01:12:59,990
I'm feeling nothing like I'm spying is there and can you look at this and

1376
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:03,470
there and can you look at this and somehow imagine what the God tells you

1377
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:06,500
somehow imagine what the God tells you but somehow it's not first this equation

1378
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:16,649
but somehow it's not first this equation without integration

1379
01:13:16,649 --> 01:13:16,659


1380
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:23,720
well it's so basically if service Bathurst is so every which is a copter

1381
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,950
Bathurst is so every which is a copter and in this case this parcel is a

1382
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:27,540
and in this case this parcel is a probability is a conditional probability

1383
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:31,260
probability is a conditional probability distribution of the the variable in that

1384
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:35,340
distribution of the the variable in that note conditioned on its parent so here I

1385
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:37,439
note conditioned on its parent so here I have the probability of X 1 conditioned

1386
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:40,140
have the probability of X 1 conditioned on the parents of X 1 what parents each

1387
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:44,520
on the parents of X 1 what parents each one has no extradition apparent which is

1388
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,430
one has no extradition apparent which is one extreme condition the parents which

1389
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:50,520
one extreme condition the parents which is one except 12 condition the parents

1390
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:54,870
is one except 12 condition the parents which is 2 X tribe on 2 &amp; 3 that's fixed

1391
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:59,870
which is 2 X tribe on 2 &amp; 3 that's fixed on 5 &amp; 3 &amp; at 7 on 4 5 &amp; 6

1392
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:05,939
on 5 &amp; 3 &amp; at 7 on 4 5 &amp; 6 now the reason that this looks way

1393
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:09,180
now the reason that this looks way simpler run the what the product will

1394
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:11,459
simpler run the what the product will repel you write the people first time we

1395
01:14:11,459 --> 01:14:14,340
repel you write the people first time we have actually said one condition of x1

1396
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:17,939
have actually said one condition of x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 the fact that you don't

1397
01:14:17,939 --> 01:14:22,740
x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 the fact that you don't have X 1 X 2 X 3 X 2 X 3 means that X 7

1398
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:26,910
have X 1 X 2 X 3 X 2 X 3 means that X 7 is independent of the variables X 1 X 2

1399
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:27,390
is independent of the variables X 1 X 2 X 3

1400
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:32,129
X 3 given the variables X 4 X 5 vs. now I

1401
01:14:32,129 --> 01:14:34,530
given the variables X 4 X 5 vs. now I have no proof anything I'm just telling

1402
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:36,149
have no proof anything I'm just telling what the answers would be when we do the

1403
01:14:36,149 --> 01:14:40,260
what the answers would be when we do the proof okay so somehow look at the graph

1404
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:42,479
proof okay so somehow look at the graph you should be able to immediately just

1405
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:45,240
you should be able to immediately just from the graph presented the composition

1406
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,560
from the graph presented the composition that you know is the correct

1407
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,750
that you know is the correct decomposition so here I have to do

1408
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:51,330
decomposition so here I have to do calculations by chant and try for 10

1409
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:53,100
calculations by chant and try for 10 hours and addition so that you know

1410
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:58,580
hours and addition so that you know immediately with that perform this and

1411
01:14:58,580 --> 01:14:58,590


1412
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:09,419
this you know you know if we had seven variables and each variable takes K

1413
01:15:09,419 --> 01:15:12,600
variables and each variable takes K values the with no independence

1414
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,280
values the with no independence relations right I'm gonna need five to

1415
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,010
relations right I'm gonna need five to the seventh to describe the joint

1416
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:19,500
the seventh to describe the joint probability distribution on the left

1417
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,350
probability distribution on the left hand side but you noticed

1418
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:25,410
hand side but you noticed requiring sort of probability tables

1419
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:29,130
requiring sort of probability tables Hotel smaller size so let's say P X 1

1420
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:32,910
Hotel smaller size so let's say P X 1 you need K values be affected to give an

1421
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:35,940
you need K values be affected to give an extra on K square I'm not a counting

1422
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:37,290
extra on K square I'm not a counting here for the harmonization of this

1423
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:40,590
here for the harmonization of this probabilities make like is e this is K 3

1424
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:44,610
probabilities make like is e this is K 3 and this is K 4 so basically if we have

1425
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:46,620
and this is K 4 so basically if we have independence relations that you see in

1426
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,720
independence relations that you see in the graph we haven't really proved

1427
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,300
the graph we haven't really proved anything again I emphasized this is

1428
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,600
anything again I emphasized this is lecture wrong to just scare you so you

1429
01:15:54,600 --> 01:16:00,990
lecture wrong to just scare you so you can not come on closely but this it's K

1430
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:03,540
can not come on closely but this it's K to the fourth versus if you have no

1431
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:05,310
to the fourth versus if you have no independence at all which would be K to

1432
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:08,400
independence at all which would be K to the sub okay so independence relations

1433
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,130
the sub okay so independence relations and independence relations in the graph

1434
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:13,680
and independence relations in the graph G no imply from the talk but let's say

1435
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:17,090
G no imply from the talk but let's say no two and three are not linked right

1436
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:19,920
no two and three are not linked right two and seven are not linked politics on

1437
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,590
two and seven are not linked politics on of being one is definitely so this lot

1438
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:25,080
of being one is definitely so this lot of edges between knowledge is what leads

1439
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,660
of edges between knowledge is what leads to this factorization and that's very

1440
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:29,220
to this factorization and that's very nice because you can read it on the

1441
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:30,660
nice because you can read it on the clock because each of these

1442
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:34,110
clock because each of these distributions is a factor of the

1443
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:35,430
distributions is a factor of the probability of hits note from this

1444
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:39,940
probability of hits note from this knowledge part

1445
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:39,950


1446
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:45,020
145 that's when we supposed to finish all right so I'm going to continue on

1447
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:48,530
all right so I'm going to continue on this lecture with a few more examples

1448
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:51,230
this lecture with a few more examples and then we will take things slowly and

1449
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:55,670
and then we will take things slowly and discuss all the details on directed

1450
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:59,030
discuss all the details on directed graphs and we will move from there

1451
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:02,660
graphs and we will move from there so the website I will try to put the

1452
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:06,920
so the website I will try to put the neck strap at the latest way tomorrow

1453
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,590
neck strap at the latest way tomorrow we've had the latest by tomorrow okay

1454
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:13,220
we've had the latest by tomorrow okay and and actually I'm going to tend to

1455
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:16,900
and and actually I'm going to tend to those register and when I sent a copy of

1456
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:19,340
those register and when I sent a copy of at least paper Bakula chapter from

1457
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,810
at least paper Bakula chapter from Jordans butcher you can start reading

1458
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:23,330
Jordans butcher you can start reading them all right so I'll see you on

1459
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:25,670
them all right so I'll see you on Thursday
