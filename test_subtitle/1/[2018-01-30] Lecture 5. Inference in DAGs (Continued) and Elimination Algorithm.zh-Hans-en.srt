我敢打赌，一旦我停止讲话，海ry就会打开，好吧，让我们尝试一下
I bet the dory will open as soon as I stop talking okay let's try it

2
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:04,299
我敢打赌，一旦我停止讲话，海ry就会打开，好吧，让我们尝试一下
stop talking okay let's try it so 1231 okay you can you count the

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,460
所以1231好吧，您可以算一下门打开的秒数，因此
so 1231 okay you can you count the seconds when the door will open so the

5
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:11,470
所以1231好吧，您可以算一下门打开的秒数，因此
seconds when the door will open so the main topic today is what is called the

到目前为止，我们已经通过示例看到了它，但我们将尝试在一个示例中做到这一点。
now but we're going to try to do it in a sort of graph theoretic manner but

12
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,949
某种图论的方式，但在此之前，我需要介绍一下，如果您
now but we're going to try to do it in a sort of graph theoretic manner but

13
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:28,440
某种图论的方式，但在此之前，我需要介绍一下，如果您
sort of graph theoretic manner but before that I need to cover maybe if you

14
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:28,450
某种图论的方式，但在此之前，我需要介绍一下，如果您
before that I need to cover maybe if you slice from the previous lecture if you

15
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,210
如果您还记得我们在讲的话，请看上一讲的片段，看看我
before that I need to cover maybe if you slice from the previous lecture if you

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,339
如果您还记得我们在讲的话，请看上一讲的片段，看看我
slice from the previous lecture if you remember we're talking about you see I

17
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:35,349
如果您还记得我们在讲的话，请看上一讲的片段，看看我
remember we're talking about you see I was right

18
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:36,860
没关系，所以我们要说的不是
remember we're talking about you see I was right

19
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,860
没关系，所以我们要说的不是
was right okay so we are going to talk it was not

20
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:40,870
没关系，所以我们要说的不是
okay so we are going to talk it was not about you okay so we're going to talk

21
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,750
关于你好吧，所以我们将讨论其中一些例子
okay so we are going to talk it was not about you okay so we're going to talk

22
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,240
关于你好吧，所以我们将讨论其中一些例子
about you okay so we're going to talk about examples of actually some of them

23
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,250
关于你好吧，所以我们将讨论其中一些例子
about examples of actually some of them we will see in very fine detail so it

24
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,020
我们将看到非常详细的信息，因此稍后再说，在
about examples of actually some of them we will see in very fine detail so it

25
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:56,430
我们将看到非常详细的信息，因此稍后再说，在
we will see in very fine detail so it later on said things look weird in the

26
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:56,440
我们将看到非常详细的信息，因此稍后再说，在
later on said things look weird in the context of Bayesian inference for gosh

27
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,650
贝叶斯推论的上下文我们还没有看到这些东西，我们将
later on said things look weird in the context of Bayesian inference for gosh

28
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,420
贝叶斯推论的上下文我们还没有看到这些东西，我们将
context of Bayesian inference for gosh we have not seen these things we will

29
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:00,430
贝叶斯推论的上下文我们还没有看到这些东西，我们将
we have not seen these things we will come back to those things later on so

30
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,379
稍后再回到这些事情，所以我们已经做过的例子就是一个
we have not seen these things we will come back to those things later on so

31
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,259
稍后再回到这些事情，所以我们已经做过的例子就是一个
come back to those things later on so the example that we already did was one

32
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:07,269
稍后再回到这些事情，所以我们已经做过的例子就是一个
the example that we already did was one of polynomial regression so this

33
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:10,800
多项式回归，所以实际上这只是贝叶斯线性回归
the example that we already did was one of polynomial regression so this

34
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,990
多项式回归，所以实际上这只是贝叶斯线性回归
of polynomial regression so this actually just Bayesian linear regression

35
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,000
多项式回归，所以实际上这只是贝叶斯线性回归
actually just Bayesian linear regression so we treat the response of the system

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,849
所以我们对待标量系统的响应，我们称其为P
actually just Bayesian linear regression so we treat the response of the system

37
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:21,890
所以我们对待标量系统的响应，我们称其为P
so we treat the response of the system which is scalar and we call it P to some

38
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:21,900
所以我们对待标量系统的响应，我们称其为P
which is scalar and we call it P to some polynomial with this coefficients WI

39
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,720
系数WI是随机变量的多项式，我们写了
which is scalar and we call it P to some polynomial with this coefficients WI

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,319
系数WI是随机变量的多项式，我们写了
polynomial with this coefficients WI being random variables and we wrote the

41
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:28,329
系数WI是随机变量的多项式，我们写了
being random variables and we wrote the joint probability distribution like that

42
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:30,059
这样的联合概率分布，所以这是W的先验，这是
being random variables and we wrote the joint probability distribution like that

43
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:33,210
这样的联合概率分布，所以这是W的先验，这是
joint probability distribution like that so this is the prior of W and this is

44
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:33,220
这样的联合概率分布，所以这是W的先验，这是
so this is the prior of W and this is the likelihood so if when you W with the

45
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,819
的可能性，所以如果当你W的概率在这里还可以，而这是在
so this is the prior of W and this is the likelihood so if when you W with the

46
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:44,670
的可能性，所以如果当你W的概率在这里还可以，而这是在
the likelihood so if when you W with the probability of here okay and this is in

47
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:44,680
的可能性，所以如果当你W的概率在这里还可以，而这是在
probability of here okay and this is in its most general form all right where W

48
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,409
它最一般的形式好吧，W在Davi上具有先验，其高度为
probability of here okay and this is in its most general form all right where W

49
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,539
它最一般的形式好吧，W在Davi上具有先验，其高度为
its most general form all right where W has the prior on Davi has some height of

50
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:51,549
它最一般的形式好吧，W在Davi上具有先验，其高度为
has the prior on Davi has some height of our meters alpha and this likelihood

51
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:54,960
我们的米alpha和它的W输入的似然模型取决于
has the prior on Davi has some height of our meters alpha and this likelihood

52
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,650
我们的米alpha和它的W输入的似然模型取决于
our meters alpha and this likelihood model for its input for its W depends on

53
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:58,660
我们的米alpha和它的W输入的似然模型取决于
model for its input for its W depends on some noise variance Sigma square which

54
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,479
一些未知的方差Sigma平方，所以这又是
model for its input for its W depends on some noise variance Sigma square which

55
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,860
一些未知的方差Sigma平方，所以这又是
some noise variance Sigma square which is not known so this is sort of again in

56
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:04,870
一些未知的方差Sigma平方，所以这又是
is not known so this is sort of again in more detail the joint probability of T

57
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,490
更详细地说明了T的联合概率，即未知的响应和W

59
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:12,810
更详细地说明了T的联合概率，即未知的响应和W
these the response and W of the unknown regression coefficients so what we did

60
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,540
回归系数，所以我们做了这个介绍，我们引入了这种平板符号
these the response and W of the unknown regression coefficients so what we did

61
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,300
回归系数，所以我们做了这个介绍，我们引入了这种平板符号
regression coefficients so what we did this we introduced this plate notation

62
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,310
回归系数，所以我们做了这个介绍，我们引入了这种平板符号
this we introduced this plate notation and the everything is inside the box

63
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:24,390
而且所有东西都在盒子里面，这意味着它要重复n次，所以当
this we introduced this plate notation and the everything is inside the box

64
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,830
而且所有东西都在盒子里面，这意味着它要重复n次，所以当
and the everything is inside the box means it is repeating n times so when

65
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:28,840
而且所有东西都在盒子里面，这意味着它要重复n次，所以当
means it is repeating n times so when you say you see here you know when you

66
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,600
你说你看到这里，你知道当你尝试写联合概率时
means it is repeating n times so when you say you see here you know when you

probability of W given alpha and alpha and Sigma square is taken as fixed

78
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,190
而西格玛平方现在被当作固定参数，所以没有

233
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:57,840
再次，该板符号不显示分布的类型是
show the type of distributions are so you know if you want from Gaussian to go

234
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,440
你知道你是否想从高斯去其他没有学生的T分布
show the type of distributions are so you know if you want from Gaussian to go

to other no student T distribution something like that at this point you

237
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,670
在这一点上，您也可以这样做，所以这仍然是
to other no student T distribution something like that at this point you

238
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,620
在这一点上，您也可以这样做，所以这仍然是
something like that at this point you can do that as well so this is still a

239
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:06,630
在这一点上，您也可以这样做，所以这仍然是
can do that as well so this is still a bit more generic okay so that's the

240
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,030
通用一点好吧，这就是我们要讨论的板旋转
can do that as well so this is still a bit more generic okay so that's the

257
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:47,430
用你知道的代表块，但我们专注于一个非常隐蔽的
but then we concentrate on a very hidden Markov model called basically all the

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,130
马尔可夫模型称基本上所有变量都是离散的或处于状态空间

so I can sort of make things to look a little complicated are not simply

270
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,340
有点复杂的不是简单地将这个隐藏的马尔可夫模型扩展到一个

to what is called as reaching safe space water

277
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:27,240
水，我再说一次我在说你的地方
water and again I'm talking where I said you

278
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,250
水，我再说一次我在说你的地方
and again I'm talking where I said you know of the course but you know I want

279
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,949
知道这门课程，但你知道我想让你看到这个东西，而且如此
and again I'm talking where I said you know of the course but you know I want

280
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:31,050
知道这门课程，但你知道我想让你看到这个东西，而且如此
know of the course but you know I want you to see this thing and Beyond so

281
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:31,060
知道这门课程，但你知道我想让你看到这个东西，而且如此
you to see this thing and Beyond so actively this axis is the human state

282
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,860
积极地，这条轴是类似于您所拥有的人类状态的原因
you to see this thing and Beyond so actively this axis is the human state

283
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,259
积极地，这条轴是类似于您所拥有的人类状态的原因
actively this axis is the human state similar to what you have there why are

284
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:37,269
积极地，这条轴是类似于您所拥有的人类状态的原因
similar to what you have there why are the observations and that's the sort of

285
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:40,019
观察结果，这就是一种描述性变量，可以告诉您是否
similar to what you have there why are the observations and that's the sort of

286
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,840
观察结果，这就是一种描述性变量，可以告诉您是否
the observations and that's the sort of a descriptive variable that tells you if

287
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:42,850
观察结果，这就是一种描述性变量，可以告诉您是否
a descriptive variable that tells you if you think of this representing let's say

288
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,670
您认为这代表着，假设您知道一些模型和
a descriptive variable that tells you if you think of this representing let's say

289
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:49,620
您认为这代表着，假设您知道一些模型和
you think of this representing let's say you know some mixture of models and the

290
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:49,630
您认为这代表着，假设您知道一些模型和
you know some mixture of models and the state let's say s 1 can be 1 2 or 3 in

291
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,579
假设s 1可以是1 2或3 in
you know some mixture of models and the state let's say s 1 can be 1 2 or 3 in

292
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,110
假设s 1可以是1 2或3 in
state let's say s 1 can be 1 2 or 3 in so you can be into the different

293
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
假设s 1可以是1 2或3 in
so you can be into the different components on the mixture

294
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,730
因此，该离散变量S 1定义了混合物中的组分
so you can be into the different components on the mixture

295
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,730
因此，该离散变量S 1定义了混合物中的组分
components on the mixture so this discrete variable S 1 defines

296
00:11:59,730 --> 00:11:59,740
因此，该离散变量S 1定义了混合物中的组分
so this discrete variable S 1 defines basically import the evolution of the

297
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,759
基本上将动力学系统的演变从x1导入到
so this discrete variable S 1 defines basically import the evolution of the

298
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,769
基本上将动力学系统的演变从x1导入到
basically import the evolution of the dynamical system how you go from x1 to

299
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:04,779
基本上将动力学系统的演变从x1导入到
dynamical system how you go from x1 to x2 but also defines the observation how

300
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:07,530
x2，但也定义了观察值，您如何从X到R ok获得y1，在这里
dynamical system how you go from x1 to x2 but also defines the observation how

301
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:12,360
x2，但也定义了观察值，您如何从X到R ok获得y1，在这里
x2 but also defines the observation how you get y1 from X to R ok and here this

302
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,370
x2，但也定义了观察值，您如何从X到R ok获得y1，在这里
you get y1 from X to R ok and here this discrete particle s also evolves the

303
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,699
离散粒子s的演化方式也与我们在隐马尔可夫模型中的演化方式相同
you get y1 from X to R ok and here this discrete particle s also evolves the

304
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:16,290
离散粒子s的演化方式也与我们在隐马尔可夫模型中的演化方式相同
discrete particle s also evolves the same way as we do in a hidden Markov

305
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:16,300
离散粒子s的演化方式也与我们在隐马尔可夫模型中的演化方式相同
same way as we do in a hidden Markov model and the human-machine the tempest

306
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,139
模型和人机狂暴法则迫使第一支箭这样
same way as we do in a hidden Markov model and the human-machine the tempest

307
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,130
模型和人机狂暴法则迫使第一支箭这样
model and the human-machine the tempest law sort of forcing the first arrow so

308
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:23,140
模型和人机狂暴法则迫使第一支箭这样
law sort of forcing the first arrow so for example if this is in the robotics

309
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,840
例如，如果这是在机器人中，您可能会知道一些电源输入
law sort of forcing the first arrow so for example if this is in the robotics

310
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,720
例如，如果这是在机器人中，您可能会知道一些电源输入
for example if this is in the robotics you know maybe would be some power input

311
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:27,730
例如，如果这是在机器人中，您可能会知道一些电源输入
you know maybe would be some power input or some force input torque or something

312
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,730
或一些力输入扭矩或您在模型中输入的类似内容
you know maybe would be some power input or some force input torque or something

313
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:33,440
或一些力输入扭矩或您在模型中输入的类似内容
or some force input torque or something like that that you put in the model so

314
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,450
或一些力输入扭矩或您在模型中输入的类似内容
like that that you put in the model so this is the generic thing and this is

315
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,930
这是通用的东西，这是无限的扩展之一
like that that you put in the model so this is the generic thing and this is

316
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,910
这是通用的东西，这是无限的扩展之一
this is the generic thing and this is one of the extensions there are infinite

317
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:38,920
这是通用的东西，这是无限的扩展之一
one of the extensions there are infinite books for extensions like that and the

318
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,810
像这样的扩展书籍，对于那些人来说，好消息是坏消息
one of the extensions there are infinite books for extensions like that and the

319
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,449
像这样的扩展书籍，对于那些人来说，好消息是坏消息

320
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:45,459
像这样的扩展书籍，对于那些人来说，好消息是坏消息
good news are for the bad news for those doing a PhD is that all of the smallest

做博士学位是所有最小的问题都已经解决了20年了
good news are for the bad news for those doing a PhD is that all of the smallest

322
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,430
做博士学位是所有最小的问题都已经解决了20年了
doing a PhD is that all of the smallest basically have been addressed 20 years

323
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:50,440
做博士学位是所有最小的问题都已经解决了20年了
basically have been addressed 20 years ago ok so they may look complicated but

324
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,760
以前好，所以它们可能看起来很复杂，但是它们都完成了交易，实际上
basically have been addressed 20 years ago ok so they may look complicated but

325
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,590
以前好，所以它们可能看起来很复杂，但是它们都完成了交易，实际上

326
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
以前好，所以它们可能看起来很复杂，但是它们都完成了交易，实际上
they are all done deals and actually they have revolutionized areas from

327
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,350
他们已经彻底改变了从机器人技术到动画的领域，仅此而已
they are all done deals and actually they have revolutionized areas from

329
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
他们已经彻底改变了从机器人技术到动画的领域，仅此而已

导航卫星跟踪以及所有这些东西
these things right from but I'm giving you this is an

333
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,320
从现在开始，但我再次给您一个例子，您现在在这里看到的是
these things right from but I'm giving you this is an

334
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,090
从现在开始，但我再次给您一个例子，您现在在这里看到的是
right from but I'm giving you this is an example again now what you see here

335
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:11,100
从现在开始，但我再次给您一个例子，您现在在这里看到的是
example again now what you see here we're going to spend more than a week or

336
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,830
我们将在课程中花一两个星期以上的时间，所以我
example again now what you see here we're going to spend more than a week or

337
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,260
我们将在课程中花一两个星期以上的时间，所以我
we're going to spend more than a week or two later on in the course so what I

338
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,270
我们将在课程中花一两个星期以上的时间，所以我
two later on in the course so what I wanted to do is say I just wanted to

339
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,770
想要做的就是说我只是想向您展示仪表中的电表是如何来的
two later on in the course so what I wanted to do is say I just wanted to

340
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,050
想要做的就是说我只是想向您展示仪表中的电表是如何来的
wanted to do is say I just wanted to show you how meters come in this models

341
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:21,060
想要做的就是说我只是想向您展示仪表中的电表是如何来的
show you how meters come in this models again as a background so what i'm doing

342
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,400
再次作为背景，所以我在这里要做的是写联合
show you how meters come in this models again as a background so what i'm doing

343
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,830
再次作为背景，所以我在这里要做的是写联合
again as a background so what i'm doing here is i'm writing the joint

344
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:27,840
再次作为背景，所以我在这里要做的是写联合
here is i'm writing the joint probability of x and y in the state

345
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,260
x和y在状态空间模型中的概率明确表示为节点X
here is i'm writing the joint probability of x and y in the state

346
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,680
x和y在状态空间模型中的概率明确表示为节点X
probability of x and y in the state space model explicitly so this is node X

347
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:33,690
x和y在状态空间模型中的概率明确表示为节点X
space model explicitly so this is node X 1 so you started with P of X 1 and then

348
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,660
1，所以从X的P 1开始，然后给定X 1的y 1的P，然后给定X 2的P
space model explicitly so this is node X 1 so you started with P of X 1 and then

349
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,060
1，所以从X的P 1开始，然后给定X 1的y 1的P，然后给定X 2的P
1 so you started with P of X 1 and then P of y 1 given X 1 then P of X 2 given

350
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,070
1，所以从X的P 1开始，然后给定X 1的y 1的P，然后给定X 2的P
P of y 1 given X 1 then P of X 2 given x1 and then give right to given X 2 etc

351
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,150
x1然后赋予给定的X 2等权利，所以这些都是隐藏的
P of y 1 given X 1 then P of X 2 given x1 and then give right to given X 2 etc

352
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,580
x1然后赋予给定的X 2等权利，所以这些都是隐藏的
x1 and then give right to given X 2 etc etc all right so these are the hidden

353
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:46,590
x1然后赋予给定的X 2等权利，所以这些都是隐藏的
etc all right so these are the hidden States you want to compute these are the

354
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,130
您要计算的状态就是您可以认为它们的观测值
etc all right so these are the hidden States you want to compute these are the

355
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,590
您要计算的状态就是您可以认为它们的观测值
States you want to compute these are the observations you can think of them as

356
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
您要计算的状态就是您可以认为它们的观测值
observations you can think of them as noisy or you know there are basically

357
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,060
嘈杂，或者，如果您喜欢在某些情况下，您知道x基本上存在嘈杂的值
observations you can think of them as noisy or you know there are basically

358
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,400
嘈杂，或者，如果您喜欢在某些情况下，您知道x基本上存在嘈杂的值
noisy or you know there are basically noisy values of x if you like in some

359
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:58,410
嘈杂，或者，如果您喜欢在某些情况下，您知道x基本上存在嘈杂的值
noisy values of x if you like in some sense if the dynamics and the

360

you don't expect the same dynamics at all the time so this profit is obviously

417
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,170
一直以来，这种利润显然必须随着时间而改变，但是如果您

429
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,950
建模只是循环，所以一方面您使用相同的参数，所以显然

see there are loops and loops are not good for you ok loops are not good for

438
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,530
对你有好处，好的循环对你不好，我的意思是至少如果你

527
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:16,200
其较高的价格给您所有消费税，因此模型的逻辑性如此
excise so the logical of the model so the means data here we're going to use

528
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,840
此处的均值数据我们将在核心中使用它作为一种表示法

people would be the unknown parameters that became the conditional

533
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:25,169
人将成为成为有条件的未知参数
that became the conditional distributions in the graph which we

534
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:26,630
图中的分布，我们不知道它们是什么，所以
that became the conditional distributions in the graph which we

535
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,580
图中的分布，我们不知道它们是什么，所以
distributions in the graph which we don't know what they are so the

536
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:28,590
图中的分布，我们不知道它们是什么，所以
don't know what they are so the likelihood is assuming iid data right is

537
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:33,740
可能性是假设iid数据权是给定theta xi的X i的概率

540
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:41,240
再次对应用程序数据进行了大小写，并演变了图中的所有注释，然后
the probability of X i given theta x i again is the app data cased and evolves

541
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,850
再次对应用程序数据进行了大小写，并演变了图中的所有注释，然后
again is the app data cased and evolves all the notes in the graph and then what

542
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:43,860
再次对应用程序数据进行了大小写，并演变了图中的所有注释，然后
all the notes in the graph and then what I do is I use the factorization of the

543
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,590
我要做的是我使用图的因式分解来写X i的概率
all the notes in the graph and then what I do is I use the factorization of the

parameters theta nothing can see right in directive jobs

552
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:05,539
在指令性工作中什么也看不到对，所以再次，我的意思是
parameters theta nothing can see right in directive jobs

553
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:09,710
在指令性工作中什么也看不到对，所以再次，我的意思是

554
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:09,720
在指令性工作中什么也看不到对，所以再次，我的意思是
right so again the I means that's the beta case I so you can remove I when you

555
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,500
测试用例I，因此当您以第二种方式想到第二个术语时，可以删除我

who can sit up right so basically when you look at this equation like what does

599
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:47,909
基本上，当你看这个等式时，谁能坐得正确
you look at this equation like what does it do what can we say for the level of

600
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:49,700
对于该公式中超过的可能性水平，我们可以说什么
you look at this equation like what does it do what can we say for the level of

601
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:55,429
对于该公式中超过的可能性水平，我们可以说什么
it do what can we say for the level of likelihood in this formula that is over

602
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:56,109
在注释上，所以即使您有一个非常复杂的图表，
it do what can we say for the level of likelihood in this formula that is over

603
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:56,119
在注释上，所以即使您有一个非常复杂的图表，


604
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:04,609
在注释上，所以即使您有一个非常复杂的图表，
over the notes so even though you have a very complicated diagram right the

605
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:04,619
在注释上，所以即使您有一个非常复杂的图表，
very complicated diagram right the likelihood okay of the data it arises

606
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:09,710
数据出现的可能性还可以超过我何时知道的可能性
very complicated diagram right the likelihood okay of the data it arises

607
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,489
数据出现的可能性还可以超过我何时知道的可能性
likelihood okay of the data it arises over the likelihood you know when I

608
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:13,499
数据出现的可能性还可以超过我何时知道的可能性
over the likelihood you know when I stayed with the knowledge were in it's

609
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,739
留在其中的知识不包括该节点的社区
over the likelihood you know when I stayed with the knowledge were in it's

610
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:18,769
留在其中的知识不包括该节点的社区

611
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:18,779
留在其中的知识不包括该节点的社区
not include the community of that node because V is the likelihood of the

612
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:20,930
因为V是那个知道的家庭的可能性，这是为什么
not include the community of that node because V is the likelihood of the

613
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,299
因为V是那个知道的家庭的可能性，这是为什么
because V is the likelihood of the family of that know and why is this

614
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:23,309
因为V是那个知道的家庭的可能性，这是为什么
family of that know and why is this important because it tells you that this

615
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,909
重要，因为它告诉您这个问题是每个节点P可以
family of that know and why is this important because it tells you that this

616
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:29,060
重要，因为它告诉您这个问题是每个节点P可以
important because it tells you that this problem is theta P for each node P can

617
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,070
重要，因为它告诉您这个问题是每个节点P可以
problem is theta P for each node P can be computed separately for the parameter

618
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,700
对于泡菜人天鹅或健身P的参数分别计算

619
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,129
对于泡菜人天鹅或健身P的参数分别计算
be computed separately for the parameter which a pickle people Swan or fitness P

620
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:34,139
对于泡菜人天鹅或健身P的参数分别计算
which a pickle people Swan or fitness P plus 2 so you can actually compute the

621
00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:36,289
加2，因此您实际上可以在本地为其音符计算参数，因为
which a pickle people Swan or fitness P plus 2 so you can actually compute the

622
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:40,070
加2，因此您实际上可以在本地为其音符计算参数，因为
plus 2 so you can actually compute the parameters locally for its note because

623
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
加2，因此您实际上可以在本地为其音符计算参数，因为
parameters locally for its note because they decouple the way this to be the

624
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,680
当您有不完整的数据但他们将这种方式解耦时，
parameters locally for its note because they decouple the way this to be the

625
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,279
当您有不完整的数据但他们将这种方式解耦时，
they decouple the way this to be the case when you have incomplete data but

626
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:49,289
当您有不完整的数据但他们将这种方式解耦时，
case when you have incomplete data but now I do notice if from this equation if

627
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:52,460
现在我确实从这个等式中注意到，如果您有完整的数据，您会得到一个产品
case when you have incomplete data but now I do notice if from this equation if

628
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,979
现在我确实从这个等式中注意到，如果您有完整的数据，您会得到一个产品
now I do notice if from this equation if you have complete data you get a product

629
00:22:57,979 --> 00:22:57,989
现在我确实从这个等式中注意到，如果您有完整的数据，您会得到一个产品
you have complete data you get a product of terms solids

630
00:22:57,989 --> 00:22:59,659
固体不行，所以配方会分解
you have complete data you get a product of terms solids

631
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:02,239
固体不行，所以配方会分解
of terms solids no okay so the recipe would decompose

632
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:02,249
固体不行，所以配方会分解
no okay so the recipe would decompose the quality the graphs left okay and if

633
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:05,359
图形的质量还可以，如果您想知道盲目可能性
no okay so the recipe would decompose the quality the graphs left okay and if

634
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,669
图形的质量还可以，如果您想知道盲目可能性
the quality the graphs left okay and if you want you know to go blind likelihood

635
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679
图形的质量还可以，如果您想知道盲目可能性
you want you know to go blind likelihood then you want to introduce a prior for

636
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,259
那么您想为参数引入先验，就可以做一个简单的
you want you know to go blind likelihood then you want to introduce a prior for

637
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:11,389
那么您想为参数引入先验，就可以做一个简单的
then you want to introduce a prior for the parameters you can make a simple

638
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:11,399
那么您想为参数引入先验，就可以做一个简单的
the parameters you can make a simple assumption that the prior of the

639
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:12,769
假设参数排序支持的先验到达
the parameters you can make a simple assumption that the prior of the

假设参数排序支持的先验到达
assumption that the prior of the parameter sort support arrives over the

641
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:14,580
假设参数排序支持的先验到达
parameter sort support arrives over the nodes so basically this makes sense

642
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,349
节点，所以基本上这是合理的，因为您的分布
parameter sort support arrives over the nodes so basically this makes sense

643
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:21,169
节点，所以基本上这是合理的，因为您的分布
nodes so basically this makes sense right because you the distribution for

644
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:21,179
节点，所以基本上这是合理的，因为您的分布
right because you the distribution for the Rises and you have every conditional

645
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:24,409
上升，您将有一个带节点的引导的所有条件分布
right because you the distribution for the Rises and you have every conditional

646
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:25,759
上升，您将有一个带节点的引导的所有条件分布
the Rises and you have every conditional distribution of leading with a node

647
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:25,769
上升，您将有一个带节点的引导的所有条件分布
distribution of leading with a node having this theta T so you can put a

648
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:27,529
有了这个theta T，所以你可以放一个先验但像这样的循环然后
distribution of leading with a node having this theta T so you can put a

649
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,810
有了这个theta T，所以你可以放一个先验但像这样的循环然后
having this theta T so you can put a prior but loops like that and then the

650
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:29,820
有了这个theta T，所以你可以放一个先验但像这样的循环然后
prior but loops like that and then the posterior

651
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,349
后部狐狸也出现在音符上，所以
prior but loops like that and then the posterior

652
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:34,519
后部狐狸也出现在音符上，所以
posterior Fox arises over notes as well right so

653
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:34,529
后部狐狸也出现在音符上，所以
Fox arises over notes as well right so if you can do Bayesian inference to

654
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:37,039
如果可以进行贝叶斯推断以计算theta T RT，请单独注意
Fox arises over notes as well right so if you can do Bayesian inference to

compute theta T RT to note separately I'm going to give you a very specific

657
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,460
我很快会给你一个非常具体的例子，但这有点

658
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,810
我很快会给你一个非常具体的例子，但这有点

659
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:46,820
我很快会给你一个非常具体的例子，但这有点

660
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:51,280
方程在这里非常重要
example soon okay but this to sort of equations are extremely important here

661
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,390
轻描淡写，只有当您有完整的数据描述时，

00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,730
轻描淡写，只有当您有完整的数据描述时，
make any bit of tact this is only when you have complete data describe if there

664
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:57,740
轻描淡写，只有当您有完整的数据描述时，
you have complete data describe if there are missing data this is not the case

665
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,440
缺少数据，情况并非如此，所以您知道他们说这是一个
you have complete data describe if there are missing data this is not the case

666
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,010
缺少数据，情况并非如此，所以您知道他们说这是一个

667
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:03,020
缺少数据，情况并非如此，所以您知道他们说这是一个
all right so you know they said it's a different story that we will see later

668
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,350
不同的故事，我们将在稍后看到，但这有点琐碎
all right so you know they said it's a different story that we will see later

669
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,240
不同的故事，我们将在稍后看到，但这有点琐碎

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,090
概率以表格的形式给出，所以我们在谈论
tables all right so we're talking about discrete variables practically valuable

689

responding to the values of their parents okay and then what you do is you

709
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:33,340
父母好吧，然后您要做的是，您符合分类分布，所以
responding to the values of their parents okay and then what you do is you

710
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,580
父母好吧，然后您要做的是，您符合分类分布，所以

父母好吧，然后您要做的是，您符合分类分布，所以
fit a categorical distribution okay so the probability of T given its balance

712
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,129
考虑到T处于状态C的T的概率是分类的

00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:00,049
这个Thetas在那里有一些RT可以参加，就像你基本上
participate as you basically the probability of being theta T C 1 is the

724
00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:02,529
成为TC 1的概率是处于状态1的概率
participate as you basically the probability of being theta T C 1 is the

725
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:04,289
成为TC 1的概率是处于状态1的概率
probability of being theta T C 1 is the probability of being in state 1

726
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:04,299
成为TC 1的概率是处于状态1的概率
probability of being in state 1 disappears the probability of being in

727
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:06,490
消失了处于状态T的可能性，因此，如果将所有这些总和相加，
probability of being in state 1 disappears the probability of being in

728
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,590
消失了处于状态T的可能性，因此，如果将所有这些总和相加，
disappears the probability of being in state T so if you sum all of this you

729
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:08,600
消失了处于状态T的可能性，因此，如果将所有这些总和相加，
state T so if you sum all of this you get 1 but remember it appreciates the

730
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,279
等于1，但请记住，它赞赏在节点3处成为状态K的可能性
state T so if you sum all of this you get 1 but remember it appreciates the

731
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,700
等于1，但请记住，它赞赏在节点3处成为状态K的可能性
get 1 but remember it appreciates the probability of being state K at node 3

732
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:15,710
等于1，但请记住，它赞赏在节点3处成为状态K的可能性
probability of being state K at node 3 given that the parents are in state C

733
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,220
鉴于父母都处于C状态，所以基本上你不能说我的意思
probability of being state K at node 3 given that the parents are in state C

734
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,070
鉴于父母都处于C状态，所以基本上你不能说我的意思
given that the parents are in state C right so basically you cannot say I mean

735
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,080
鉴于父母都处于C状态，所以基本上你不能说我的意思
right so basically you cannot say I mean you can't do the modular calculation if

736
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,019
如果需要，您不能进行模块化计算，但是在这里
right so basically you cannot say I mean you can't do the modular calculation if

737
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:29,169
如果需要，您不能进行模块化计算，但是在这里
you can't do the modular calculation if you want to but here too

738
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:29,179
如果需要，您不能进行模块化计算，但是在这里
you want to but here too we're going to the table tell us the

739
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:33,369
我们将在表中告诉我们在给定状态下3的概率
you want to but here too we're going to the table tell us the

740
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:35,740
我们将在表中告诉我们在给定状态下3的概率
we're going to the table tell us the probability of 3 given the state of the

741
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:35,750
我们将在表中告诉我们在给定状态下3的概率
probability of 3 given the state of the parents all right and we pick this with

742
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,560
家长，好的，我们选择该类别并对其进行分类
probability of 3 given the state of the parents all right and we pick this with

743
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,029
家长，好的，我们选择该类别并对其进行分类
parents all right and we pick this with a categorical distribution of this

744
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:40,039
家长，好的，我们选择该类别并对其进行分类
a categorical distribution of this parameters with this normalization so

745
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:43,749
归一化的参数，所以让我们显式地写出theta D CK
a categorical distribution of this parameters with this normalization so

746
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:48,580
归一化的参数，所以让我们显式地写出theta D CK
parameters with this normalization so let's write this explicitly theta D CK

747
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:48,590
归一化的参数，所以让我们显式地写出theta D CK
let's write this explicitly theta D CK is the probability P means again 90 okay

748
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:53,440
是P再次表示90的概率好吗，我们在90
let's write this explicitly theta D CK is the probability P means again 90 okay

749
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,909
是P再次表示90的概率好吗，我们在90
is the probability P means again 90 okay we're working at 90

750
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:54,919
是P再次表示90的概率好吗，我们在90
we're working at 90 so it's no it has its own conditional

751
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:56,889
所以不是，它有自己的条件概率，所以p ck是概率
we're working at 90 so it's no it has its own conditional

752
00:26:56,889 --> 00:27:00,850
所以不是，它有自己的条件概率，所以p ck是概率
so it's no it has its own conditional probability so p ck is the probability

753
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:00,860
所以不是，它有自己的条件概率，所以p ck是概率
probability so p ck is the probability that X days it takes the value K when

754
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,820
在X天里，当植物可以接受修道院的时候，其价值为K。

759
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:10,309
此处的行业顺序是任意权利，您可以将其反转
arbitrary right you could have reverse it so this is the notation used here

760
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:12,669
所以这是这里使用的符号，节点K是
arbitrary right you could have reverse it so this is the notation used here

761
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:16,149
所以这是这里使用的符号，节点K是
it so this is the notation used here there is the node K is the value that

762
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:16,159
所以这是这里使用的符号，节点K是
there is the node K is the value that the XT will take given that the parents

00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:01,630
伯爵我的意思是，这有点像，如果你看这是兄弟，实际上
watch this is brother actually there's no algebraic just like you know you know

844
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:06,240
就像您知道的一样，没有代数，所以这足够了
watch this is brother actually there's no algebraic just like you know you know

845
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,649
就像您知道的一样，没有代数，所以这足够了
no algebraic just like you know you know so this is sort of the sufficient

846
00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:07,659
就像您知道的一样，没有代数，所以这足够了
so this is sort of the sufficient statistics for this problem so it's a

847
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:10,919
此问题的统计数据，因此它是数据科学家指标的国家
so this is sort of the sufficient statistics for this problem so it's a

848
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,440
此问题的统计数据，因此它是数据科学家指标的国家
statistics for this problem so it's a nation of the data scientists indicator

849
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:13,450
此问题的统计数据，因此它是数据科学家指标的国家
nation of the data scientists indicator function and counts the time senior data

850
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,560
函数并计算时间T的高级数据集，其中没有T处于状态k

set that no T is in state k given that it's parents are in state C so the the

853
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,919
它的父母处于C状态，因此每日平均分配
set that no T is in state k given that it's parents are in state C so the the

854
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,340
它的父母处于C状态，因此每日平均分配
it's parents are in state C so the the mean of the distribution the daily

855
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:29,350
它的父母处于C状态，因此每日平均分配
mean of the distribution the daily distribution basically there has if you

856
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,899
分布基本上有，如果您在Wikipedia上查看，将会看到
mean of the distribution the daily distribution basically there has if you

857
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:36,149
分布基本上有，如果您在Wikipedia上查看，将会看到
distribution basically there has if you check on Wikipedia will see what the

858
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:36,159
分布基本上有，如果您在Wikipedia上查看，将会看到
check on Wikipedia will see what the meanest is for example for this

859
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,730
例如，平均而言，此分布为50 GK除以
check on Wikipedia will see what the meanest is for example for this

860
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:44,190
例如，平均而言，此分布为50 GK除以
meanest is for example for this distribution is 50 G K divided by the

861
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:44,200
例如，平均而言，此分布为50 GK除以
distribution is 50 G K divided by the summation of alpha T C K prime for all

862
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,619
所有磁带行的alpha TCK素数的总和，因此
distribution is 50 G K divided by the summation of alpha T C K prime for all

863
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:48,389
所有磁带行的alpha TCK素数的总和，因此
summation of alpha T C K prime for all tape lines so the mean of the

864
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:48,399
所有磁带行的alpha TCK素数的总和，因此
tape lines so the mean of the distribution of the posterior comes to

865
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,850
后验分布就是这个关键计数加上alpha D CK
tape lines so the mean of the distribution of the posterior comes to

866
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,499
后验分布就是这个关键计数加上alpha D CK
distribution of the posterior comes to be this critical count plus alpha D CK

867
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:55,509
后验分布就是这个关键计数加上alpha D CK
be this critical count plus alpha D CK from the prior and then in the numerator

868
00:30:55,509 --> 00:30:59,190
从先验，然后在分子分母中，您实际上有
be this critical count plus alpha D CK from the prior and then in the numerator

869
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,680
从先验，然后在分子分母中，您实际上有
from the prior and then in the numerator denominator you have this actually

870
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:01,690
从先验，然后在分子分母中，您实际上有
denominator you have this actually should be inside parentheses you know

871
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,690
应该在您知道的括号内，即使在这里很明显，所以这
denominator you have this actually should be inside parentheses you know

872
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,850
应该在您知道的括号内，即使在这里很明显，所以这
should be inside parentheses you know even though it's obvious here so this

873
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:05,860
应该在您知道的括号内，即使在这里很明显，所以这
even though it's obvious here so this whole automation here count over K prime

874
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,549
这里的整个自动化超过K素数，所以如果您说您使用了非预期的
even though it's obvious here so this whole automation here count over K prime

875
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:16,649
这里的整个自动化超过K素数，所以如果您说您使用了非预期的
whole automation here count over K prime so if let's say you use an unintended

876
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:16,659
这里的整个自动化超过K素数，所以如果您说您使用了非预期的
so if let's say you use an unintended clip I or where all the surface are

877
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:19,710
夹住I或所有表面都等于1的情况
so if let's say you use an unintended clip I or where all the surface are

878
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,519
夹住I或所有表面都等于1的情况
clip I or where all the surface are equal to one so actively this is sort of

879
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:23,529
夹住I或所有表面都等于1的情况
equal to one so actively this is sort of regularization so you just add one in

880
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:26,970
正则化，所以您只需在所有经验值中加一个
equal to one so actively this is sort of regularization so you just add one in

881
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,430
正则化，所以您只需在所有经验值中加一个
regularization so you just add one in all the empirical counts so if let's say

882
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:29,440
正则化，所以您只需在所有经验值中加一个
all the empirical counts so if let's say foreign state

883
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,690
外国你没有测量宇宙说
all the empirical counts so if let's say foreign state

884
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,180
外国你没有测量宇宙说
foreign state you have no measurements universe say

885
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,190
外国你没有测量宇宙说
you have no measurements universe say that they would never happen

886
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,710
他们永远不会发生天鹅你使它成为可能，那是
you have no measurements universe say that they would never happen

887
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,200
他们永远不会发生天鹅你使它成为可能，那是
that they would never happen Swan you make it possible and that's

888
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,210
他们永远不会发生天鹅你使它成为可能，那是
Swan you make it possible and that's what this thing does it sort of the

889
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,779
这个东西对直方图有什么作用是这种类型的问题
Swan you make it possible and that's what this thing does it sort of the

890
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:42,669
这个东西对直方图有什么作用是这种类型的问题
what this thing does it sort of the histogram is this problem for this type

891
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:42,679
这个东西对直方图有什么作用是这种类型的问题
histogram is this problem for this type of prevents well let's see an example so

892
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:50,230
的预防措施很好，让我们来看一个例子，所以我们有一个直接阻止
histogram is this problem for this type of prevents well let's see an example so

893
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,799
的预防措施很好，让我们来看一个例子，所以我们有一个直接阻止
of prevents well let's see an example so this is so we have a direct block with

894
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:53,809
的预防措施很好，让我们来看一个例子，所以我们有一个直接阻止
this is so we have a direct block with five nodes and let's say we get some

895
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:58,299
五个节点，假设我们得到了一些数据
this is so we have a direct block with five nodes and let's say we get some

00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:40,779
我想我想很明显，在这种情况下，二元体运动
the realizations of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 and we have I am going to I think

901
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:46,360
我想我想很明显，在这种情况下，二元体运动
and we have I am going to I think obviously the binary body motion in this

902
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:46,370
我想我想很明显，在这种情况下，二元体运动
obviously the binary body motion in this problem of forgot to mention obviously

903
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,730
问题显然忘记了提及，所以过程是0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1和
obviously the binary body motion in this problem of forgot to mention obviously

904
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:52,870
问题显然忘记了提及，所以过程是0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1和
problem of forgot to mention obviously so the process is 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 and

905
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:52,880
问题显然忘记了提及，所以过程是0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1和
so the process is 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 and Here I am

906
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,230
这是我在数据集中所占的比重，这不是
so the process is 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 and Here I am

907
00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:02,320
这是我在数据集中所占的比重，这不是

假设零件处于状态C，这是阶段1或阶段0的结果
0 given that the parts are in state C which is defined on the rolls on the

912
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:10,330
它在左侧的卷上定义，您会看到确定，所以让我们
0 given that the parts are in state C which is defined on the rolls on the

913
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:18,340
它在左侧的卷上定义，您会看到确定，所以让我们
which is defined on the rolls on the left hand side you see that ok so let's

914
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:18,350
它在左侧的卷上定义，您会看到确定，所以让我们
left hand side you see that ok so let's look at the case when the parents are at

915
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,620
看父母在1 1的情况下多少次看数据集
left hand side you see that ok so let's look at the case when the parents are at

916
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:25,149
看父母在1 1的情况下多少次看数据集
look at the case when the parents are at 1 1 how many times look at the data set

917
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:25,159
看父母在1 1的情况下多少次看数据集
1 1 how many times look at the data set when X 2 next year of at 1 how many

918
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:28,539
当下一年的X 2等于K的多少倍K知道第一个节点位于
1 1 how many times look at the data set when X 2 next year of at 1 how many

919
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:33,610
当下一年的X 2等于K的多少倍K知道第一个节点位于
when X 2 next year of at 1 how many times K the know T the first node is at

920
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:33,620
当下一年的X 2等于K的多少倍K知道第一个节点位于
times K the know T the first node is at 1 so I see one case here and I see two

921
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,230
1所以我在这里看到一种情况，而我们看到了两种
times K the know T the first node is at 1 so I see one case here and I see two

922
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,480
1所以我在这里看到一种情况，而我们看到了两种
1 so I see one case here and I see two we do

923
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:40,590
同样地，让我们看看音符有多少次
1 so I see one case here and I see two we do

924
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:40,600
同样地，让我们看看音符有多少次


925
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,580
同样地，让我们看看音符有多少次
similarly let's see how many times the note

926
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:43,590
同样地，让我们看看音符有多少次
note is a k equal to 0 when this is 1 and 1

927
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:47,040
等于1和1时ak等于0 2 1 1 0 1好的
note is a k equal to 0 when this is 1 and 1

928
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,270
等于1和1时ak等于0 2 1 1 0 1好的
is a k equal to 0 when this is 1 and 1 the 2 1 1 0 1 okay

929
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:50,280
等于1和1时ak等于0 2 1 1 0 1好的
the 2 1 1 0 1 okay 21 and so we can either they say the

930
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,540
21，所以我们可以说如果您不这样做，则概率为a
the 2 1 1 0 1 okay 21 and so we can either they say the

931
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,050
21，所以我们可以说如果您不这样做，则概率为a
21 and so we can either they say the probability if you don't do this a

932
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:58,060
21，所以我们可以说如果您不这样做，则概率为a
probability if you don't do this a priori and you use the MLE estimate the

933
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,900
先验，然后您使用MLE估计概率，或者说v pc k等于
probability if you don't do this a priori and you use the MLE estimate the

934
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,450
先验，然后您使用MLE估计概率，或者说v pc k等于
priori and you use the MLE estimate the probability let's say or v pc k equal to

935
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:03,460
先验，然后您使用MLE估计概率，或者说v pc k等于
probability let's say or v pc k equal to 1 I mean I should actually I hope I

936
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,470
1我的意思是我实际上应该希望我不要混淆您的意思我的意思350
probability let's say or v pc k equal to 1 I mean I should actually I hope I

937
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,240
1我的意思是我实际上应该希望我不要混淆您的意思我的意思350
1 I mean I should actually I hope I don't confuse you care what I mean 350

938
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:09,250
1我的意思是我实际上应该希望我不要混淆您的意思我的意思350
don't confuse you care what I mean 350 see k equal to 1 I mean pick up this G 1

939
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:13,190
看到k等于1我的意思是捡起这个G 1就是我的意思，所以
don't confuse you care what I mean 350 see k equal to 1 I mean pick up this G 1

940
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,900
看到k等于1我的意思是捡起这个G 1就是我的意思，所以
see k equal to 1 I mean pick up this G 1 that's what I mean okay so the

941
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:15,910
看到k等于1我的意思是捡起这个G 1就是我的意思，所以
that's what I mean okay so the probability of P that is T 1 the mean

942
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:19,020
P的概率为T 1如果不做，则不做平均值
that's what I mean okay so the probability of P that is T 1 the mean

943
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,169
P的概率为T 1如果不做，则不做平均值
probability of P that is T 1 the mean value if you don't do if you don't put

944
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:22,179
P的概率为T 1如果不做，则不做平均值
value if you don't do if you don't put any prior will be let's say 2 divided by

945
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:24,870
之前的任何事都可以用2除以3来表示，但请记住，我们必须添加
value if you don't do if you don't put any prior will be let's say 2 divided by

946
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,780
之前的任何事都可以用2除以3来表示，但请记住，我们必须添加
any prior will be let's say 2 divided by 3 but remember we have to add on the

947
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:27,790
之前的任何事都可以用2除以3来表示，但请记住，我们必须添加
3 but remember we have to add on the previous diagram if we use the clave

948
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:31,940
上图，如果我们使用系数为1的先验分布
3 but remember we have to add on the previous diagram if we use the clave

949
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,350
上图，如果我们使用系数为1的先验分布
previous diagram if we use the clave distributions prior with coefficient 1

950
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:34,360
上图，如果我们使用系数为1的先验分布
distributions prior with coefficient 1 we have to add 1 to the counts so it

951
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,380
我们必须将1加到计数上，所以它将被3除以5，这将是
distributions prior with coefficient 1 we have to add 1 to the counts so it

952
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,890
我们必须将1加到计数上，所以它将被3除以5，这将是
we have to add 1 to the counts so it will be 3 divided by 5 and here will be

953
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:40,900
我们必须将1加到计数上，所以它将被3除以5，这将是
will be 3 divided by 5 and here will be 1 plus 1 2 divided by 5

954
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,150
1加1 2除以5好
will be 3 divided by 5 and here will be 1 plus 1 2 divided by 5

955
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,160
1加1 2除以5好
1 plus 1 2 divided by 5 alright

956
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,869
显然，变量是离散的，所以您知道这么复杂，但是
1 plus 1 2 divided by 5 alright

957
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:48,879
显然，变量是离散的，所以您知道这么复杂，但是


958
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:58,500
显然，变量是离散的，所以您知道这么复杂，但是
obviously the variables are discrete you know so such a complicated but in

959
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:58,510
显然，变量是离散的，所以您知道这么复杂，但是
know so such a complicated but in essence you know even if the

960
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,210
本质上，即使分布是高斯分布或存在
know so such a complicated but in essence you know even if the

973
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:27,150
个人数据，所以您知道一些事情，而您却不知道所有事情，所以这
personal data so you know some things you don't know all the things so this

974
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:27,160
个人数据，所以您知道一些事情，而您却不知道所有事情，所以这
you don't know all the things so this could be the real problem we have to

975
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,500
可能是真正的问题，我们必须在此类中处理，但是如果您完成
you don't know all the things so this could be the real problem we have to

976
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,410
可能是真正的问题，我们必须在此类中处理，但是如果您完成
could be the real problem we have to deal in this class but if your complete

977
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:31,420
可能是真正的问题，我们必须在此类中处理，但是如果您完成
deal in this class but if your complete data it's an easy problem and actually

982
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,240
模拟以生成大量数据，然后将它们拟合为这两个模型
simulation to generate a lots of data and then they fit these two models you

983
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,250
模拟以生成大量数据，然后将它们拟合为这两个模型
and then they fit these two models you know you may have the case indeed what

984
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,579
知道您可能确实遇到了您在图中描述的情况
and then they fit these two models you know you may have the case indeed what

985
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:48,960

resistance so you can use this type of organization so let me drink some coffee

990
00:35:54,299 --> 00:35:58,859
组织，所以让我喝点咖啡，然后我们改变主题
resistance so you can use this type of organization so let me drink some coffee

991
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:02,549
组织，所以让我喝点咖啡，然后我们改变主题
organization so let me drink some coffee and then we change subject

992
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:05,200
今天我给星巴克装了咖啡，因为他们告诉我咖啡加起来
organization so let me drink some coffee and then we change subject

today I fitted up the Starbucks because they told me that coffee went up to

995
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:10,099
今天我给星巴克装了咖啡，因为他们告诉我咖啡加起来
they told me that coffee went up to three or five and I said since when

996
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:13,150
三五点，我说，因为昨天我在那儿的时候，他们
they told me that coffee went up to three or five and I said since when

997
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,309
三五点，我说，因为昨天我在那儿的时候，他们
three or five and I said since when because I was there yesterday then they

998
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:15,319
三五点，我说，因为昨天我在那儿的时候，他们
because I was there yesterday then they said to me are you kiddin and I said of

999
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:17,589
对我说你是孩子吗？我当然对95说
because I was there yesterday then they said to me are you kiddin and I said of

1000
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:21,309
对我说你是孩子吗？我当然对95说
said to me are you kiddin and I said of course then to 95

1001
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:25,820
所以你知道也许明天你们伙计给我四处走走学生证，这样我就可以
said to me are you kiddin and I said of course then to 95

1002
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:25,830
所以你知道也许明天你们伙计给我四处走走学生证，这样我就可以


1003
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:31,220
所以你知道也许明天你们伙计给我四处走走学生证，这样我就可以
so you know maybe tomorrow you guys give me go around your student card so I can

1004
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,230
所以你知道也许明天你们伙计给我四处走走学生证，这样我就可以
me go around your student card so I can hit it you know and get my discount what

1005
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,670
打它，你知道并得到我的折扣，这就像歧视是什么
me go around your student card so I can hit it you know and get my discount what

1006
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,600
打它，你知道并得到我的折扣，这就像歧视是什么
hit it you know and get my discount what is that it's like discrimination is it

1007
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,340
我会再次见到我，他们基本上是在踏板车上问您三件事
hit it you know and get my discount what is that it's like discrimination is it

1008
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:39,350
我会再次见到我，他们基本上是在踏板车上问您三件事


1009
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:55,820
我会再次见到我，他们基本上是在踏板车上问您三件事
I'm going to see me again they asked you on the scooter basically three things we

1010
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:55,830
我会再次见到我，他们基本上是在踏板车上问您三件事
on the scooter basically three things we already have seen and then try to

1011
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,500
已经看过，然后尝试介绍一些概念，但是我们使
on the scooter basically three things we already have seen and then try to

1012
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:04,310
已经看过，然后尝试介绍一些概念，但是我们使
already have seen and then try to introduce some concepts but we make the

1013
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:04,320
已经看过，然后尝试介绍一些概念，但是我们使
introduce some concepts but we make the elimination over basically easily to

1014
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,670
基本上可以轻松消除编程问题，我将要做一些
introduce some concepts but we make the elimination over basically easily to

1015
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:16,160
基本上可以轻松消除编程问题，我将要做一些
elimination over basically easily to program I'm gonna do something sort of a

1016
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,170
基本上可以轻松消除编程问题，我将要做一些
program I'm gonna do something sort of a little bit stupid but you know we're all

1017
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,830
有点愚蠢，但你知道我们都已经成熟，所以你知道我要带
program I'm gonna do something sort of a little bit stupid but you know we're all

1018
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,820
有点愚蠢，但你知道我们都已经成熟，所以你知道我要带
little bit stupid but you know we're all mature so you know I'm gonna bring maybe

1019
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:22,830
有点愚蠢，但你知道我们都已经成熟，所以你知道我要带
mature so you know I'm gonna bring maybe if not today

00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,160
真的在讨论一些细节，因为我不想将本次演讲分为
don't want to split this lecture on directed graphs and then three weeks

1026
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,220
有向图，然后三个星期后，您会从中得到相同的结果
don't want to split this lecture on directed graphs and then three weeks

有向图，然后三个星期后，您会从中得到相同的结果
directed graphs and then three weeks later tell you the same things from

1028
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:35,640
有向图，然后三个星期后，您会从中得到相同的结果
later tell you the same things from directed ok so I'm gonna sit in some

1029
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,360
指示确定，所以我将坐在一些您需要了解的信息中
later tell you the same things from directed ok so I'm gonna sit in some

directed ok so I'm gonna sit in some information that you need to know about

1031
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:39,720
指示确定，所以我将坐在一些您需要了解的信息中
information that you need to know about undirected graphs and discuss this

1032
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,500
无向图，并讨论这个消除算法，您可以
information that you need to know about undirected graphs and discuss this

1033
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:54,890
无向图，并讨论这个消除算法，您可以
undirected graphs and discuss this elimination algorithm you can he'll

1034
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:54,900
无向图，并讨论这个消除算法，您可以
elimination algorithm you can he'll think of some notes that would describe

1035
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,130
想到一些描述它们的音符，所以这是加粗的Aryan，这些是
elimination algorithm you can he'll think of some notes that would describe

1036
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,310
想到一些描述它们的音符，所以这是加粗的Aryan，这些是
think of some notes that would describe them so this is bolded Aryan these are

1037
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:01,320
想到一些描述它们的音符，所以这是加粗的Aryan，这些是
them so this is bolded Aryan these are the evidence no notes these are the

1038
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,170
没有证据的证据这些是查询节点，这就是您想要的
them so this is bolded Aryan these are the evidence no notes these are the

1039
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,230
没有证据的证据这些是查询节点，这就是您想要的
the evidence no notes these are the query nodes right this is what you want

1040
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:09,240
没有证据的证据这些是查询节点，这就是您想要的
query nodes right this is what you want to compute and there are some hidden

1041
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,120
计算并有一些隐藏的注释，您知道是否要
query nodes right this is what you want to compute and there are some hidden

1042
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,650
计算并有一些隐藏的注释，您知道是否要
to compute and there are some hidden notes and you know if you want to

1043
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:12,660
计算并有一些隐藏的注释，您知道是否要
notes and you know if you want to complete them you can complete them but

1044
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,600
完成它们，您可以完成它们，但是在这里，我要做的就是
notes and you know if you want to complete them you can complete them but

1045
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,740
完成它们，您可以完成它们，但是在这里，我要做的就是
complete them you can complete them but here what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

1046
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:15,750
完成它们，您可以完成它们，但是在这里，我要做的就是
here what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna quite hidden noise because you don't

1047
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,750
相当隐蔽的噪音，因为您不在乎一切，所以积极地
here what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna quite hidden noise because you don't

1048
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:22,250
相当隐蔽的噪音，因为您不在乎一切，所以积极地
quite hidden noise because you don't care about all right so actively this is

1049
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:22,260
相当隐蔽的噪音，因为您不在乎一切，所以积极地
care about all right so actively this is your Q K X 1 given X ticks and you can

1050
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,910
您的QKX 1给定X滴答声，您可以全部知道自己不知道
care about all right so actively this is your Q K X 1 given X ticks and you can

1051
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:28,250
您的QKX 1给定X滴答声，您可以全部知道自己不知道
your Q K X 1 given X ticks and you can all of this knows that you don't know so

1052
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:28,260
您的QKX 1给定X滴答声，您可以全部知道自己不知道
all of this knows that you don't know so what you need to do is integrate them

1053
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,020
您需要做的就是将它们整合起来，我想我们已经拥有了
all of this knows that you don't know so what you need to do is integrate them

1054
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,569
您需要做的就是将它们整合起来，我想我们已经拥有了
what you need to do is integrate them out and I think we already have

1055
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:32,579
您需要做的就是将它们整合起来，我想我们已经拥有了
out and I think we already have discussed that the big picture basically

1056
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:34,670
讨论了大图基本上看起来像您在
out and I think we already have discussed that the big picture basically

1057
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,740
讨论了大图基本上看起来像您在
discussed that the big picture basically looks like the equation you see on the

1058
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:36,750
讨论了大图基本上看起来像您在
looks like the equation you see on the on the bottle alright so we want to

1059
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:40,160
好在瓶子上，所以我们要计算给定X的概率
looks like the equation you see on the on the bottle alright so we want to

1060
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,470
好在瓶子上，所以我们要计算给定X的概率
on the bottle alright so we want to compute the probability of X hath given

1061
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:42,480
好在瓶子上，所以我们要计算给定X的概率
compute the probability of X hath given the X the evidence and I write this as

1062
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,849
X是证据，我将其写为XF和XT的联合概率，
compute the probability of X hath given the X the evidence and I write this as

1063
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:50,109
X是证据，我将其写为XF和XT的联合概率，
the X the evidence and I write this as the joint probability of X F and X T and

1064
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:50,119
X是证据，我将其写为XF和XT的联合概率，
the joint probability of X F and X T and that probability can be written as all

1065
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,180
那个概率可以写成所有联合所有的所有概率
the joint probability of X F and X T and that probability can be written as all

1066
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,339
那个概率可以写成所有联合所有的所有概率
that probability can be written as all the probability of all the joint all the

1067
00:38:55,339 --> 00:38:55,349
那个概率可以写成所有联合所有的所有概率
the probability of all the joint all the body moves with the hidden variables

1068
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:57,260
阀体与隐藏变量集成的阀一起运动，然后在这里
the probability of all the joint all the body moves with the hidden variables

1069
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,870
阀体与隐藏变量集成的阀一起运动，然后在这里
body moves with the hidden variables integrated valve and then here you have

1070
00:38:59,870 --> 00:38:59,880
阀体与隐藏变量集成的阀一起运动，然后在这里
integrated valve and then here you have the probability of ecstasy which means

1071
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,210
摇头丸的可能性，这意味着它必须与excel联合
integrated valve and then here you have the probability of ecstasy which means

1072
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,130
摇头丸的可能性，这意味着它必须与excel联合
the probability of ecstasy which means it will have to the joint with excel

1073
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:04,140
摇头丸的可能性，这意味着它必须与excel联合
it will have to the joint with excel four exits integrated out remember that

1074
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,599
集成了四个出口，请记住，没有任何幻想可能是轮换
it will have to the joint with excel four exits integrated out remember that

1079
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:14,700
是稍微不同的权利，所以我们需要知道这是什么
need to know this is what the elimination algorithm is how can we use

1082
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:19,799
消除算法是如何利用乘积理论思想来做的
of the product theoretic ideas to do this effectively and and I think in some

1083
00:39:19,799 --> 00:39:22,549
这很有效，我认为在某些示例中我们强调了这一点
of the product theoretic ideas to do this effectively and and I think in some

1084
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:24,200
这很有效，我认为在某些示例中我们强调了这一点
this effectively and and I think in some of the examples we have highlighted this

1085
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:24,210
这很有效，我认为在某些示例中我们强调了这一点
of the examples we have highlighted this but hopefully today if we managed to

1086
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:27,230
但希望今天如果我们能够完成此任务，我们将看到一些想法
of the examples we have highlighted this but hopefully today if we managed to

1087
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,230
但希望今天如果我们能够完成此任务，我们将看到一些想法
but hopefully today if we managed to finish this we will see some ideas have

1088
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,240
但希望今天如果我们能够完成此任务，我们将看到一些想法
finish this we will see some ideas have some graphs don't need absolutist so me

1089
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,690
有些图不需要绝对主义者，所以我告诉你这里的主意是
finish this we will see some ideas have some graphs don't need absolutist so me

1090
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:37,039
有些图不需要绝对主义者，所以我告诉你这里的主意是
some graphs don't need absolutist so me tell you what the idea is here is we're

1091
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:37,049
有些图不需要绝对主义者，所以我告诉你这里的主意是
tell you what the idea is here is we're going to use the distribution law when

1092
00:39:37,049 --> 00:39:41,960
在进行这些求和时将使用分配定律，所以你知道我
tell you what the idea is here is we're going to use the distribution law when

1093
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,289
在进行这些求和时将使用分配定律，所以你知道我
going to use the distribution law when we do these summations and so you know I

1094
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:45,299
在进行这些求和时将使用分配定律，所以你知道我
we do these summations and so you know I give you here an example you have the

1095
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,819
这里给你一个例子，你有一些恒定时间XI的总和
we do these summations and so you know I give you here an example you have the

1096
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:50,289
这里给你一个例子，你有一些恒定时间XI的总和
give you here an example you have the summation of some constant times X I

1097
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:50,299
这里给你一个例子，你有一些恒定时间XI的总和
summation of some constant times X I obviously you can move that constant R

1098
00:39:50,299 --> 00:39:53,299
显然，您可以将常数R移开并说出alpha乘以Sigma XI，所以
summation of some constant times X I obviously you can move that constant R

1099
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:56,660
显然，您可以将常数R移开并说出alpha乘以Sigma XI，所以
obviously you can move that constant R far out and say alpha times Sigma X I so

1100
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:56,670
显然，您可以将常数R移开并说出alpha乘以Sigma XI，所以
far out and say alpha times Sigma X I so that's one of the compilations were

1101
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,390
这是将要使用的汇编之一，从更一般的意义上讲
far out and say alpha times Sigma X I so that's one of the compilations were

1102
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,420
这是将要使用的汇编之一，从更一般的意义上讲
that's one of the compilations were going to use and in a more general sense

1103
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:02,430
这是将要使用的汇编之一，从更一般的意义上讲
going to use and in a more general sense if we have summation on you know think

1104
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,650
如果我们有求和，就知道x1 xn上的这些离散变量
going to use and in a more general sense if we have summation on you know think

1105
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:09,620
如果我们有求和，就知道x1 xn上的这些离散变量
if we have summation on you know think of these discrete variables on the x1 xn

and inside we have alpha 1 X 1 over 2 X 2 etcetera

1109
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:18,780
在里面，我们有1 X 1 X 2 X 2等
2 etcetera look what I have done I took this

1110
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,870
看看我做了什么我服用了这款产品，然后将它们分成几部分，
2 etcetera look what I have done I took this

1111
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,539
看看我做了什么我服用了这款产品，然后将它们分成几部分，
look what I have done I took this product and I split them in pieces and

1112
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:23,549
看看我做了什么我服用了这款产品，然后将它们分成几部分，
product and I split them in pieces and then I pushed on with the summations so

1113
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:27,319
然后我继续进行求和，所以每个求和仅在右边进行
product and I split them in pieces and then I pushed on with the summations so

1114
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:29,150
然后我继续进行求和，所以每个求和仅在右边进行
then I pushed on with the summations so each of them operates only on the right

1115
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:29,160
然后我继续进行求和，所以每个求和仅在右边进行
each of them operates only on the right argument so if I want to start on extend

1116
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,270
参数，所以如果我想开始扩展
each of them operates only on the right argument so if I want to start on extend

1117
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:32,930
参数，所以如果我想开始扩展
argument so if I want to start on extend which

1118
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:32,940
参数，所以如果我想开始扩展
which the point of having the whole number can

1119
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,480
具有整数的观点可以节省产品扩展剂的吟时间
which the point of having the whole number can

1120
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,760
具有整数的观点可以节省产品扩展剂的吟时间
the point of having the whole number can save groans time on extender for product

1121
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:37,770
具有整数的观点可以节省产品扩展剂的吟时间
save groans time on extender for product where an X n it only appears from the

1122
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,400
X n只能从联邦时间xn出现，所以我有什么
save groans time on extender for product where an X n it only appears from the

1123
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,960
X n只能从联邦时间xn出现，所以我有什么
where an X n it only appears from the federal time xn all right so I have what

1124
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:44,970
X n只能从联邦时间xn出现，所以我有什么
federal time xn all right so I have what you do this if you push xn all the way

1125
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,290
如果您将xn完全推入，则可以执行此操作，这样您就可以使用它了
federal time xn all right so I have what you do this if you push xn all the way

1126
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,569
如果您将xn完全推入，则可以执行此操作，这样您就可以使用它了
you do this if you push xn all the way in so you could use this then you

1127
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:50,579
如果您将xn完全推入，则可以执行此操作，这样您就可以使用它了
in so you could use this then you compute the summation xn minus 1 and

1128
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:52,700
计算总和xn减去1，然后最终计算
in so you could use this then you compute the summation xn minus 1 and

1129
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,800
计算总和xn减去1，然后最终计算
compute the summation xn minus 1 and then eventually you compute the

1130
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:54,810
计算总和xn减去1，然后最终计算
then eventually you compute the sturbation on xn so the idea is what you

1131
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:57,980
在xn上进行扰动，因此您将在此处看到执行此求和的想法
then eventually you compute the sturbation on xn so the idea is what you

1132
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,230
在xn上进行扰动，因此您将在此处看到执行此求和的想法
sturbation on xn so the idea is what you see here for performing this summation

1142
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:19,020
累积振铃，但基本上与操作加号和
with the operations plus and multiplication so this is the

1143
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,079
乘法，所以这是有效的关联交换律
with the operations plus and multiplication so this is the

1144
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,980
乘法，所以这是有效的关联交换律
multiplication so this is the associative commutative law effectively

1145
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:23,990
乘法，所以这是有效的关联交换律

好吧，我们称它们为隐藏变量的总数是Billis all
of hidden variables is is Billis all right so obviously the summation of the

1175
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,800
对，因此很明显，隐藏变量的总和将导致
of hidden variables is is Billis all right so obviously the summation of the

1189
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:54,160
一个发球出去，他们是可能的，所以我们是力量
list of that so we are to the power rates and I'm not the kind of thing that

1190
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,980
率，我不是那种需要被边缘化的事情

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,090
大图这是一个很大的数字，我们不喜欢它不会
grantee body works okay but this is for the big graph this is a big number and

1197
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,270
大图这是一个很大的数字，我们不喜欢它不会
the big graph this is a big number and we don't like it it will not be

1198
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:08,280
大图这是一个很大的数字，我们不喜欢它不会
we don't like it it will not be efficient to do marginalization right so

1199
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,940
做边缘化的效率很高，所以让我们在星型算法中进行讨论
we don't like it it will not be efficient to do marginalization right so

1200
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:19,620
做边缘化的效率很高，所以让我们在星型算法中进行讨论
efficient to do marginalization right so let's discuss this in star algorithm

1201
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,070
所以我们有更好的选择，如果我们愿意的话，我们想做很多事情，
efficient to do marginalization right so let's discuss this in star algorithm

1202
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:22,080
所以我们有更好的选择，如果我们愿意的话，我们想做很多事情，


1203
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:32,630
所以我们有更好的选择，如果我们愿意的话，我们想做很多事情，
so we have a better to go and let's say if we want to we want to do much an

1204
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:32,640
所以我们有更好的选择，如果我们愿意的话，我们想做很多事情，
if we want to we want to do much an unsession or no deck 6

1205
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,040
没有会议，没有甲板6好的，所以我们想做的是，如果可以的话
if we want to we want to do much an unsession or no deck 6

1206
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:39,470
没有会议，没有甲板6好的，所以我们想做的是，如果可以的话
unsession or no deck 6 ok so what we want to do so if you can

1207
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:39,480
没有会议，没有甲板6好的，所以我们想做的是，如果可以的话
ok so what we want to do so if you can do this in an aviary right so this

1208
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,680
用鸟的权利来做这件事，所以这个总结将是六个操作
ok so what we want to do so if you can do this in an aviary right so this

1209
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,540
用鸟的权利来做这件事，所以这个总结将是六个操作
do this in an aviary right so this summation would be six operations well

1210
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:47,550
用鸟的权利来做这件事，所以这个总结将是六个操作
summation would be six operations well I'm sorry

1211
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,410
很抱歉，如果要进行六次操作，
summation would be six operations well I'm sorry

1212
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,840
很抱歉，如果要进行六次操作，
I'm sorry six operations if this takes on the

1213
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:50,850
很抱歉，如果要进行六次操作，
six operations if this takes on the values the summation onyx 6 will be our

1214
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:54,260
值onyx 6将是我们对其他每个值的运算
six operations if this takes on the values the summation onyx 6 will be our

1215
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,600
值onyx 6将是我们对其他每个值的运算
values the summation onyx 6 will be our operations for each of the other values

1216
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:56,610
值onyx 6将是我们对其他每个值的运算
operations for each of the other values of this and this and this and this will

1217
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,520
这个，这个，这个和这个中的一个，基本上是总共六个
operations for each of the other values of this and this and this and this will

1218
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,590
这个，这个，这个和这个中的一个，基本上是总共六个
of this and this and this and this will be a total basically for to the six

1219
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:00,600
这个，这个，这个和这个中的一个，基本上是总共六个
be a total basically for to the six operation ok so let's see a way that

1220
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,260
好的操作，让我们来看看这种白色拉链在执行此操作时的方法
be a total basically for to the six operation ok so let's see a way that

1221
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:06,230
好的操作，让我们来看看这种白色拉链在执行此操作时的方法
operation ok so let's see a way that this way white zipper in performing this

1222
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:06,240
好的操作，让我们来看看这种白色拉链在执行此操作时的方法
this way white zipper in performing this what we don't do up to the six

1223
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,240
在这六项操作中我们没有做的是什么，所以我在这里所做的是
this way white zipper in performing this what we don't do up to the six

1224
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,790
在这六项操作中我们没有做的是什么，所以我在这里所做的是
what we don't do up to the six operations so what I have done here is I

1225
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:10,800
在这六项操作中我们没有做的是什么，所以我在这里所做的是
operations so what I have done here is I wrote the factorization of the golf

1226
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,130
写了高尔夫的因式分解权，给定x1给定x1 x3给定效果
operations so what I have done here is I wrote the factorization of the golf

1227
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:17,120
写了高尔夫的因式分解权，给定x1给定x1 x3给定效果
wrote the factorization of the golf right the effects 1 x2 given x1 x3 given

1228
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:17,130
写了高尔夫的因式分解权，给定x1给定x1 x3给定效果
right the effects 1 x2 given x1 x3 given X 2 X 5 given the power that 3x tix

1229
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,630
X 2 X 5赋予了3x tix赋予其父母等的力量，然后当我
right the effects 1 x2 given x1 x3 given X 2 X 5 given the power that 3x tix

1230
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:24,320
X 2 X 5赋予了3x tix赋予其父母等的力量，然后当我
X 2 X 5 given the power that 3x tix given its parents etc and then when I

1231
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:24,330
X 2 X 5赋予了3x tix赋予其父母等的力量，然后当我
given its parents etc and then when I have done is like this the summation on

1232
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,030
这样就完成了对X的求和，一直到右边，因为
given its parents etc and then when I have done is like this the summation on

1233
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,120
这样就完成了对X的求和，一直到右边，因为
have done is like this the summation on X takes all the way to the right because

1234
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,130
这样就完成了对X的求和，一直到右边，因为
X takes all the way to the right because that's the only place 4 X 6 counts and

1235
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:31,810
那是4 X 6计数的唯一位置，此分布的总和为
X takes all the way to the right because that's the only place 4 X 6 counts and

1236
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:34,310
那是4 X 6计数的唯一位置，此分布的总和为
that's the only place 4 X 6 counts and the summation of this distribution is

1237
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:34,320
那是4 X 6计数的唯一位置，此分布的总和为
the summation of this distribution is actually equal to 1 because it's a body

1238
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,030
实际上等于1，因为它是身体的条件分布
the summation of this distribution is actually equal to 1 because it's a body

1239
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:39,410
实际上等于1，因为它是身体的条件分布
actually equal to 1 because it's a body conditional distribution that is

1240
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:39,420
实际上等于1，因为它是身体的条件分布
conditional distribution that is normalized so how much handsome I have

1241
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,450
归一化，所以有多少帅哥我必须什么都不做0，所以如果你实际上做
conditional distribution that is normalized so how much handsome I have

1242
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:45,290
归一化，所以有多少帅哥我必须什么都不做0，所以如果你实际上做
normalized so how much handsome I have to do 0 nothing so if you actually do

1243
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:45,300
归一化，所以有多少帅哥我必须什么都不做0，所以如果你实际上做
to do 0 nothing so if you actually do this you will find yourselves doing

1244
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,180
你会发现自己在第六次之后做的时候
to do 0 nothing so if you actually do this you will find yourselves doing

1245
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,580
你会发现自己在第六次之后做的时候
this you will find yourselves doing after the 6th when this actually

1246
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:49,590
你会发现自己在第六次之后做的时候
after the 6th when this actually requires ok it is shown right maybe this

1247
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:59,650
要求确定，它显示正确，也许这不是一个东西
after the 6th when this actually requires ok it is shown right maybe this

1248
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:02,960
要求确定，它显示正确，也许这不是一个东西
requires ok it is shown right maybe this it is it is not one which is something

1249
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:02,970
要求确定，它显示正确，也许这不是一个东西
it is it is not one which is something else here and if he has 3 arguments the

1250
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,890
否则在这里，如果他有3个参数，则求和将是
it is it is not one which is something else here and if he has 3 arguments the

1251
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:09,350
否则在这里，如果他有3个参数，则求和将是
else here and if he has 3 arguments the doing the summation will be out to a

1252
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:09,360
否则在这里，如果他有3个参数，则求和将是
doing the summation will be out to a power which is way better than out to

1253
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,130
胜过第六次幂的能力
doing the summation will be out to a power which is way better than out to

1254
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:13,850
胜过第六次幂的能力
power which is way better than out to the sixth power

1255
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:13,860
胜过第六次幂的能力
the sixth power ok so this is what we need to take

1256
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,950
好，这就是我们需要利用的地方
the sixth power ok so this is what we need to take

1257
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,070
好，这就是我们需要利用的地方
ok so this is what we need to take advantage

1258
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:18,080
好，这就是我们需要利用的地方
advantage like there's a lot of a sell-off and

1259
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,020
就像有很多抛售，实际上提醒我我要寄给你
advantage like there's a lot of a sell-off and

1260
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,510
就像有很多抛售，实际上提醒我我要寄给你
like there's a lot of a sell-off and actually remind me I'm going to send you

1261
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:22,520
就像有很多抛售，实际上提醒我我要寄给你
actually remind me I'm going to send you a copy of absorbance chapter to read

1262
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,480
吸光度章节的副本阅读这本书，我从中提取了这么大
actually remind me I'm going to send you a copy of absorbance chapter to read

1263
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,580
吸光度章节的副本阅读这本书，我从中提取了这么大
a copy of absorbance chapter to read this book where I extracted this big

1264
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:27,590
吸光度章节的副本阅读这本书，我从中提取了这么大
this book where I extracted this big sirs okay so if I forget to do that not

1265
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:30,490
先生，好吧，如果我忘了做那件事，不是我，因为今天我回家之前，
this book where I extracted this big sirs okay so if I forget to do that not

1266
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:34,950
先生，好吧，如果我忘了做那件事，不是我，因为今天我回家之前，
sirs okay so if I forget to do that not me because the before I go home today so

1267
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:34,960
先生，好吧，如果我忘了做那件事，不是我，因为今天我回家之前，
me because the before I go home today so so again the same problem we want to

1268
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,960
因此，同样的问题，我们要计算不，我们要计算
me because the before I go home today so so again the same problem we want to

1269
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,480
因此，同样的问题，我们要计算不，我们要计算
so again the same problem we want to compute no we want to compute a

1270
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:40,490
因此，同样的问题，我们要计算不，我们要计算
compute no we want to compute a summation with a spectrum of Pi it's

1271
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,790
用Pi谱进行求和比较有趣，所以我要做的是
compute no we want to compute a summation with a spectrum of Pi it's

1272
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:46,720
用Pi谱进行求和比较有趣，所以我要做的是
summation with a spectrum of Pi it's more interesting okay so what I do is I

1273
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:46,730
用Pi谱进行求和比较有趣，所以我要做的是
more interesting okay so what I do is I take the joint but it's factorize like

1274
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:49,900
采取联合，但它像这样分解，然后我推求和
more interesting okay so what I do is I take the joint but it's factorize like

1275
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,120
采取联合，但它像这样分解，然后我推求和
take the joint but it's factorize like this and then I am pushing the summation

1276
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,130
采取联合，但它像这样分解，然后我推求和
this and then I am pushing the summation or X 5 to the right to include only the

1277
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:56,380
或X 5右侧，仅包括取决于X 5的条款，您会注意到
this and then I am pushing the summation or X 5 to the right to include only the

1278
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,780
或X 5右侧，仅包括取决于X 5的条款，您会注意到
or X 5 to the right to include only the terms that depend on X 5 and you notice

1279
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:58,790
或X 5右侧，仅包括取决于X 5的条款，您会注意到
terms that depend on X 5 and you notice I have included X Y given X 3 all right

1280
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,720
我将XY赋予X 3包括在内，但x6也赋予了XY的一部分
terms that depend on X 5 and you notice I have included X Y given X 3 all right

1281
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,050
我将XY赋予X 3包括在内，但x6也赋予了XY的一部分
I have included X Y given X 3 all right but x6 given also it's part of the

1282
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:05,060
我将XY赋予X 3包括在内，但x6也赋予了XY的一部分
but x6 given also it's part of the experience part ok so I have to perform

1283
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,930
经验不错，所以我必须对这个学期做一个总结，我们要
but x6 given also it's part of the experience part ok so I have to perform

1284
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,720
经验不错，所以我必须对这个学期做一个总结，我们要
experience part ok so I have to perform a summation of this term and we're going

1285
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:10,730
经验不错，所以我必须对这个学期做一个总结，我们要
a summation of this term and we're going to call this a new potential we're going

1286
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:15,280
称它为新的潜力，我们将给它起一个名字，我将
a summation of this term and we're going to call this a new potential we're going

1287
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,200
称它为新的潜力，我们将给它起一个名字，我将
to call this a new potential we're going to give it some name and I'm going to

1288
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:17,210
称它为新的潜力，我们将给它起一个名字，我将
to give it some name and I'm going to call the potential P and I'm going to

1289
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,780
叫电位P，我要下标X 5，所以X 5会提醒我
to give it some name and I'm going to call the potential P and I'm going to

1290
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,920
叫电位P，我要下标X 5，所以X 5会提醒我
call the potential P and I'm going to put a subscript X 5 so X 5 reminds me

1291
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:23,930
叫电位P，我要下标X 5，所以X 5会提醒我
put a subscript X 5 so X 5 reminds me with snow that destination the tree

1292
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:28,570
带着雪，目的地是雄树将要被淘汰的树
put a subscript X 5 so X 5 reminds me with snow that destination the tree

1293
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:31,150
带着雪，目的地是雄树将要被淘汰的树
with snow that destination the tree which male is going to be eliminated

1294
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:31,160
带着雪，目的地是雄树将要被淘汰的树
which male is going to be eliminated okay expiry is to know that I'm doing

1295
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,430
好吧，到期是要知道我正在做加法运算以及您在X 5上卖出的时间
which male is going to be eliminated okay expiry is to know that I'm doing

1296
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,100
好吧，到期是要知道我正在做加法运算以及您在X 5上卖出的时间
okay expiry is to know that I'm doing the summation and when you sell on X 5

1297
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:36,110
好吧，到期是要知道我正在做加法运算以及您在X 5上卖出的时间
the summation and when you sell on X 5 what your master is the potential is

1298
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,350
您的主人所具有的潜力将是X 2或X 3的函数，并且
the summation and when you sell on X 5 what your master is the potential is

1299
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:41,140
您的主人所具有的潜力将是X 2或X 3的函数，并且
what your master is the potential is going to be a function of X 2 or X 3 and

00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:41,150
您的主人所具有的潜力将是X 2或X 3的函数，并且
going to be a function of X 2 or X 3 and X 6 so if you live there the arguments

1301
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:44,800
X 6所以如果你住在那儿，你还没有想到其余的人
going to be a function of X 2 or X 3 and X 6 so if you live there the arguments

1302
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,720
X 6所以如果你住在那儿，你还没有想到其余的人
X 6 so if you live there the arguments that you haven't thought the rest of you

1303
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:46,730
X 6所以如果你住在那儿，你还没有想到其余的人
that you haven't thought the rest of you saw basically whatever your Psalm is

1304
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:50,290
基本上看到了您的诗篇将作为此基础的内容
that you haven't thought the rest of you saw basically whatever your Psalm is

1305
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:51,730
基本上看到了您的诗篇将作为此基础的内容
saw basically whatever your Psalm is going to come as a substrate from this

1306
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:51,740
基本上看到了您的诗篇将作为此基础的内容
going to come as a substrate from this potential okay so let's I have say so

1307
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:57,970
潜在的好吧，让我们说一下原始图，它告诉我们
going to come as a substrate from this potential okay so let's I have say so

1308
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:01,120
潜在的好吧，让我们说一下原始图，它告诉我们

variables elimination are good so this types begin

1375
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,180
消除是很好的，所以这种类型完全是这里发生的事情，所以
variables elimination are good so this types begin

1376
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,390
消除是很好的，所以这种类型完全是这里发生的事情，所以
elimination are good so this types begin out exactly what's going on here so

1377
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:44,400
消除是很好的，所以这种类型完全是这里发生的事情，所以
out exactly what's going on here so let's do the marginalization for what

1378
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,559
我们只对theta X 1 X 2感兴趣的东西进行边缘化处理，所以我们
out exactly what's going on here so let's do the marginalization for what

1379
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,400
我们只对theta X 1 X 2感兴趣的东西进行边缘化处理，所以我们
let's do the marginalization for what interested in theta X 1 X 2 only so we

1380
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:52,410
我们只对theta X 1 X 2感兴趣的东西进行边缘化处理，所以我们
interested in theta X 1 X 2 only so we need to sum on X 3 X 4 X 5 at 6:00

1381
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:55,309
需要在6:00在X 3 X 4 X 5上求和，所以我将做一个求和
interested in theta X 1 X 2 only so we need to sum on X 3 X 4 X 5 at 6:00

1382
00:49:55,309 --> 00:49:58,730
需要在6:00在X 3 X 4 X 5上求和，所以我将做一个求和
need to sum on X 3 X 4 X 5 at 6:00 so I'm going to do the summations one

1383
00:49:58,730 --> 00:49:58,740
需要在6:00在X 3 X 4 X 5上求和，所以我将做一个求和
so I'm going to do the summations one term at the time

1384
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,630
从树叶开始一直到现在的学期
so I'm going to do the summations one term at the time

1385
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,390
从树叶开始一直到现在的学期
term at the time starting from the leaves all the way up

1386
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:02,400
从树叶开始一直到现在的学期
starting from the leaves all the way up to X 3 all right

1387
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,980
到X 3，然后我们将看到发生了什么
starting from the leaves all the way up to X 3 all right

1388
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,690
到X 3，然后我们将看到发生了什么
to X 3 all right and then we will see what happens to the

1389
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:05,700
到X 3，然后我们将看到发生了什么
and then we will see what happens to the down so I leave X 2 X 4 2 X 5 here and I

1390
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:11,480
向下，所以我在这里留下X 2 X 4 2 X 5，并且对X 6求和，所以当我站在
and then we will see what happens to the down so I leave X 2 X 4 2 X 5 here and I

1391
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,430
向下，所以我在这里留下X 2 X 4 2 X 5，并且对X 6求和，所以当我站在
down so I leave X 2 X 4 2 X 5 here and I do a summation on X 6 so when I stand on

1392
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:16,440
向下，所以我在这里留下X 2 X 4 2 X 5，并且对X 6求和，所以当我站在
do a summation on X 6 so when I stand on its sixth

1393
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,180
它的第六名显然是诺维克第六名
do a summation on X 6 so when I stand on its sixth

1394
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,299
它的第六名显然是诺维克第六名
its sixth alright obviously the Novik sixth will

1395
00:50:20,299 --> 00:50:20,309
它的第六名显然是诺维克第六名
alright obviously the Novik sixth will disappear now this is equal to 1 right

1396
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:24,470
现在消失，它等于1对，但让我们忘记它等于1
alright obviously the Novik sixth will disappear now this is equal to 1 right

1397
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:27,309
现在消失，它等于1对，但让我们忘记它等于1
disappear now this is equal to 1 right but let's forget that it is equal to 1

1398
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:27,319
现在消失，它等于1对，但让我们忘记它等于1
but let's forget that it is equal to 1 this will give me a potential that I do

1399
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:31,370
这将给我一个我不玩的潜力，因为我订阅了这6个，因为
but let's forget that it is equal to 1 this will give me a potential that I do

1400
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,559
这将给我一个我不玩的潜力，因为我订阅了这6个，因为
this will give me a potential that I do not play would subscribe that 6 because

1401
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:33,569
这将给我一个我不玩的潜力，因为我订阅了这6个，因为
not play would subscribe that 6 because this is the north of the song and the

1402
00:50:33,569 --> 00:50:36,200
这是歌曲的北部，可用的选择将过期，所以我是
not play would subscribe that 6 because this is the north of the song and the

1403
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,990
这是歌曲的北部，可用的选择将过期，所以我是
this is the north of the song and the available selects will expire so I am

1404
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:39,000
这是歌曲的北部，可用的选择将过期，所以我是
available selects will expire so I am giving you so I am going to eliminate

1405
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,559
给你，所以我现在要消除X 6并注意那里
available selects will expire so I am giving you so I am going to eliminate

1406
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,589
给你，所以我现在要消除X 6并注意那里
giving you so I am going to eliminate now that X 6 all right and notice there

1407
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:45,599
给你，所以我现在要消除X 6并注意那里
now that X 6 all right and notice there is a dotted line there what is the

1408
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,680
是一条虚线，这里的虚线是什么意思
now that X 6 all right and notice there is a dotted line there what is the

1409
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,390
是一条虚线，这里的虚线是什么意思
is a dotted line there what is the dotted line implies here

1410
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:53,560
所以在这里通过反向2和5显示了新的潜在线索，那就是
is a dotted line there what is the dotted line implies here

1411
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:53,570
所以在这里通过反向2和5显示了新的潜在线索，那就是


1412
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:58,540
所以在这里通过反向2和5显示了新的潜在线索，那就是
so here have displayed the new potential leads by reverse two and five and that's

1413
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:58,550
所以在这里通过反向2和5显示了新的潜在线索，那就是
leads by reverse two and five and that's what I do in the belly I basically say

1414
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:01,260
我基本上是说我在肚子里做的事35现在已经连接在一起了
leads by reverse two and five and that's what I do in the belly I basically say

1415
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:06,520
我基本上是说我在肚子里做的事35现在已经连接在一起了
what I do in the belly I basically say 35 are now linked together all right

1416
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,060
当时需要执行额外的步骤，所以这是一条虚线，但是您现在将看到
what I do in the belly I basically say 35 are now linked together all right

1417
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:07,070
当时需要执行额外的步骤，所以这是一条虚线，但是您现在将看到


1418
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:11,050
当时需要执行额外的步骤，所以这是一条虚线，但是您现在将看到
an additional step at the time so this is a dotted line but you would see now

1419
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:11,060
当时需要执行额外的步骤，所以这是一条虚线，但是您现在将看到
is a dotted line but you would see now in the next step I am going to make this

1420
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,480
在下一步中，我将使它也只是一个底线，所以它不会
is a dotted line but you would see now in the next step I am going to make this

1421
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,400
在下一步中，我将使它也只是一个底线，所以它不会
in the next step I am going to make this just a back line as well so it doesn't

1422
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:15,410
在下一步中，我将使它也只是一个底线，所以它不会
just a back line as well so it doesn't you know my first oh here it is this

1423
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:17,830
你知道我的第一个哦，这是这张照片，它将是总结
just a back line as well so it doesn't you know my first oh here it is this

1424
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:21,000
你知道我的第一个哦，这是这张照片，它将是总结
you know my first oh here it is this picture and it's gonna be summation on

1425
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,010
你知道我的第一个哦，这是这张照片，它将是总结
picture and it's gonna be summation on on the so become the destination xx6

1426
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:26,230
在因此成为目的地xx6时，我们得到的潜力取决于X 2
picture and it's gonna be summation on on the so become the destination xx6

1427
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,960
在因此成为目的地xx6时，我们得到的潜力取决于X 2
on the so become the destination xx6 we got the potential that depends on X 2

1428
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:28,970
在因此成为目的地xx6时，我们得到的潜力取决于X 2
we got the potential that depends on X 2 X 5 and I am going to try and X Prime

1429
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:31,540
X 5，我将尝试使用X Prime，X 5的总和将起作用
we got the potential that depends on X 2 X 5 and I am going to try and X Prime

1430
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:34,180
X 5，我将尝试使用X Prime，X 5的总和将起作用
X 5 and I am going to try and X Prime and the summation X 5 is gonna operate

1431
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:34,190
X 5，我将尝试使用X Prime，X 5的总和将起作用
and the summation X 5 is gonna operate on this x naught so on this x naught and

1432
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:40,320
在这x零上，在这x零上，新的潜力将有一个下标
and the summation X 5 is gonna operate on this x naught so on this x naught and

1433
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,210
在这x零上，在这x零上，新的潜力将有一个下标
on this x naught so on this x naught and the new potential will have a subscript

1434
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:43,220
在这x零上，在这x零上，新的潜力将有一个下标
the new potential will have a subscript X 5 because that's what I saw and what

1435
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,210
X 5，因为那是我所看到的，剩下的X 2和X 3以及我在做什么
the new potential will have a subscript X 5 because that's what I saw and what

1436
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:49,150
X 5，因为那是我所看到的，剩下的X 2和X 3以及我在做什么
X 5 because that's what I saw and what is left X 2 and X 3 and what am i doing

1437
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:49,160
X 5，因为那是我所看到的，剩下的X 2和X 3以及我在做什么
is left X 2 and X 3 and what am i doing that

1438
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:49,840
我正在连接X 2和X 3
is left X 2 and X 3 and what am i doing that

1439
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,170
我正在连接X 2和X 3
that I'm connecting X 2 and X 3 all right and

1440
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:53,180
我正在连接X 2和X 3
I'm connecting X 2 and X 3 all right and then I would get rid of note 5 leading

1441
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,110
那么我会摆脱注释5导致此正常，所以让我们继续
I'm connecting X 2 and X 3 all right and then I would get rid of note 5 leading

1442
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:02,910
那么我会摆脱注释5导致此正常，所以让我们继续
then I would get rid of note 5 leading to this ok all right so let's continue

1443
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:02,920
那么我会摆脱注释5导致此正常，所以让我们继续
to this ok all right so let's continue eliminate now if I eliminate there is no

1444
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:10,320
如果我消除了，现在就消除，没有我要担心的依赖项
to this ok all right so let's continue eliminate now if I eliminate there is no

1445
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,040
如果我消除了，现在就消除，没有我要担心的依赖项
eliminate now if I eliminate there is no dependencies that I have to worry

1446
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,050
如果我消除了，现在就消除，没有我要担心的依赖项
dependencies that I have to worry actually this summation comes here to be

1447
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:14,290
实际上，这个总和等于1，所以这个电位等于
dependencies that I have to worry actually this summation comes here to be

1448
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:17,140
实际上，这个总和等于1，所以这个电位等于
actually this summation comes here to be equal to 1 so this potential is equal to

1449
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:17,150
实际上，这个总和等于1，所以这个电位等于
equal to 1 so this potential is equal to 1 so this is eliminated I get a graph

1450
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:19,600
1，这样就消除了，我得到一个像这样的图，然后如果我摆脱了
equal to 1 so this potential is equal to 1 so this is eliminated I get a graph

1451
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,940
1，这样就消除了，我得到一个像这样的图，然后如果我摆脱了
1 so this is eliminated I get a graph like that and then if I get rid of for

1452
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:21,950
1，这样就消除了，我得到一个像这样的图，然后如果我摆脱了
like that and then if I get rid of for node 3 all right so now 3 there were

1453
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:30,610
节点3很好，所以现在3在
like that and then if I get rid of for node 3 all right so now 3 there were

1454
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:32,560
节点3很好，所以现在3在

to 1 but here we just keep it for decoration purposes why are we

1468
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:55,960
装饰目的我们为什么，所以我们基本上给了X罗恩
to 1 but here we just keep it for decoration purposes why are we

1469
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,130
装饰目的我们为什么，所以我们基本上给了X罗恩
decoration purposes why are we and and so we have basically given X Ron

1470
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:00,140
装饰目的我们为什么，所以我们基本上给了X罗恩
and and so we have basically given X Ron no actually I don't keep it the x 1 x 2

any sense all right okay so right but when you

1491
00:53:59,380 --> 00:53:59,390
任何感觉都好吧好吧，但是当你
all right okay so right but when you know whether we started this this dance

1492
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:02,320

00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,700
这个淘汰的过程还可以，所以我很快就可以开始了，但是我
this elimination process okay so I'm gonna start to get shortly okay but I

1521
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:11,710
这个淘汰的过程还可以，所以我很快就可以开始了，但是我
gonna start to get shortly okay but I just want you to appreciate that maybe

1522
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,430
只想让您欣赏，也许您听到的声音中包含三个变量

00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:20,829
并且您想要为该Revati的每个值听起来1 X 5，所以这
the values of this Revati much so this is for the highest fastest alright so

1528
00:55:20,829 --> 00:55:23,130
是为了最快的速度，所以这将定义输出的成本
the values of this Revati much so this is for the highest fastest alright so

this will define the cost of the output this is nice

1531
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,569
这很好
this will define the cost of the output this is nice

1532
00:55:30,569 --> 00:55:33,440
当您开始执行此消除权利时，您的开始方式有多重要
this will define the cost of the output this is nice

00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:41,670
当您开始执行此消除权利时，您的开始方式有多重要
how important is the way you start when you start doing this elimination right

1535
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:41,680
当您开始执行此消除权利时，您的开始方式有多重要
you start doing this elimination right you can stop how many know but if you do

1536
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,009
您可以停止了解多少信息，但是如果您只这样做，就可以解决这个小问题
you start doing this elimination right you can stop how many know but if you do

1537
00:55:44,009 --> 00:55:46,769
您可以停止了解多少信息，但是如果您只这样做，就可以解决这个小问题
you can stop how many know but if you do only you can take the trivial problem

1538
00:55:46,769 --> 00:55:46,779
您可以停止了解多少信息，但是如果您只这样做，就可以解决这个小问题
only you can take the trivial problem and make it very painful so here is a

1539
00:55:46,779 --> 00:55:49,680
并使其非常痛苦，所以这是一个问题，假设您拥有所有
only you can take the trivial problem and make it very painful so here is a

1540
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,390
并使其非常痛苦，所以这是一个问题，假设您拥有所有
and make it very painful so here is a problem let's say if you have all of

1541
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:51,400
并使其非常痛苦，所以这是一个问题，假设您拥有所有
problem let's say if you have all of these variables and somebody tells you

1542
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,519
这些变量，有人告诉您您要计算让我们看看
problem let's say if you have all of these variables and somebody tells you

1543
00:55:53,519 --> 00:56:02,069
这些变量，有人告诉您您要计算让我们看看
these variables and somebody tells you you want to compute let's see let's say

1544
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:02,079
这些变量，有人告诉您您要计算让我们看看
you want to compute let's see let's say you want to I don't know what you want

1545
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,499
你想我不知道你想对地球进行什么计算，但是让我们
you want to compute let's see let's say you want to I don't know what you want

1546
00:56:04,499 --> 00:56:05,880
你想我不知道你想对地球进行什么计算，但是让我们
you want to I don't know what you want to compute of the earth right but let's

1547
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:05,890
你想我不知道你想对地球进行什么计算，但是让我们
to compute of the earth right but let's say we want to eliminate X 1 ok first

1548
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:10,819
说我们想先消除X 1好的，也许您有一些证据，
to compute of the earth right but let's say we want to eliminate X 1 ok first

1549
00:56:10,819 --> 00:56:13,380
说我们想先消除X 1好的，也许您有一些证据，
say we want to eliminate X 1 ok first right maybe you have some evidence and

1550
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:13,390
说我们想先消除X 1好的，也许您有一些证据，
right maybe you have some evidence and you want to start doing elimination from

1551
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:15,599
您想从X 1开始进行消除，如果消除了试验，
right maybe you have some evidence and you want to start doing elimination from

1552
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,999
您想从X 1开始进行消除，如果消除了试验，
you want to start doing elimination from X 1 if you eliminate the trial what

1553
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:18,009
您想从X 1开始进行消除，如果消除了试验，
X 1 if you eliminate the trial what happens I mean I think actually the

1554
00:56:18,009 --> 00:56:23,339
发生我的意思是我认为实际上是英里的联合概率分布
X 1 if you eliminate the trial what happens I mean I think actually the

1555
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,140
发生我的意思是我认为实际上是英里的联合概率分布
happens I mean I think actually the joint probability distribution for miles

1556
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:25,150
发生我的意思是我认为实际上是英里的联合概率分布
joint probability distribution for miles on the graph right if you do militates

1557
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:27,329
在图表右侧，如果您确实先犯了什么，那是怎么回事
joint probability distribution for miles on the graph right if you do militates

1558
00:56:27,329 --> 00:56:31,170
在图表右侧，如果您确实先犯了什么，那是怎么回事
on the graph right if you do militates one first what's going on

1559
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:32,540
显示依赖关系现在将在依赖关系的所有各方之间
on the graph right if you do militates one first what's going on

1560
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:32,550
显示依赖关系现在将在依赖关系的所有各方之间


1561
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:39,470
显示依赖关系现在将在依赖关系的所有各方之间
show the dependencies now will be between party all while it was depend on

1562
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:39,480
显示依赖关系现在将在依赖关系的所有各方之间
between party all while it was depend on everything else good luck you took

1563
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,380
其他所有的好运，你采取了某种看起来没有
between party all while it was depend on everything else good luck you took

1564
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,450
其他所有的好运，你采取了某种看起来没有
everything else good luck you took something that sort of was not looking

1565
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:44,460
其他所有的好运，你采取了某种看起来没有
something that sort of was not looking bad and now we have a graph that it's

1566
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,910
不好，现在我们有一个图，它很好地连接了所有正确的数字，
something that sort of was not looking bad and now we have a graph that it's

1567
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:53,050
不好，现在我们有一个图，它很好地连接了所有正确的数字，
bad and now we have a graph that it's pretty connected all right number and

1568
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:53,060
不好，现在我们有一个图，它很好地连接了所有正确的数字，
pretty connected all right number and obviously you have to program this ideas

1569
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,370
显然，您必须正确地编写此想法，因为您无法阅读说
pretty connected all right number and obviously you have to program this ideas

1570
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,080
显然，您必须正确地编写此想法，因为您无法阅读说
obviously you have to program this ideas right so because you cannot read say

1571
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:57,090
显然，您必须正确地编写此想法，因为您无法阅读说
right so because you cannot read say what a nice do not move this and do that

1572
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,660
不错，不要移动它，而是这样做，因为您知道它只是视觉上的
right so because you cannot read say what a nice do not move this and do that

1573
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,940
不错，不要移动它，而是这样做，因为您知道它只是视觉上的
what a nice do not move this and do that because you know it's just visually you

1574
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:01,950
不错，不要移动它，而是这样做，因为您知道它只是视觉上的
because you know it's just visually you won't be able to see what's going on so

1575
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:04,130
将无法看到正在发生的事情，所以可以肯定这不是，而是
because you know it's just visually you won't be able to see what's going on so

1576
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,110
将无法看到正在发生的事情，所以可以肯定这不是，而是
won't be able to see what's going on so certainly this is really not but look

1577
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:06,120
将无法看到正在发生的事情，所以可以肯定这不是，而是
certainly this is really not but look what happens if I go eliminated sorry X

1578
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,630
如果我淘汰了，将会发生什么事抱歉X 3 X 3基本上不引入其他任何东西
certainly this is really not but look what happens if I go eliminated sorry X

1579
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:11,480
如果我淘汰了，将会发生什么事抱歉X 3 X 3基本上不引入其他任何东西
what happens if I go eliminated sorry X 3 X 3 basically introduces no additional

1580
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:11,490
如果我淘汰了，将会发生什么事抱歉X 3 X 3基本上不引入其他任何东西
3 X 3 basically introduces no additional dependencies because the X 3 comes only

1581
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:14,150
依赖关系，因为X 3仅在给定X 1的情况下出现X 3的概率
3 X 3 basically introduces no additional dependencies because the X 3 comes only

1582
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:15,950
依赖关系，因为X 3仅在给定X 1的情况下出现X 3的概率
dependencies because the X 3 comes only in the probability of X 3 given X 1

1583
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:15,960
依赖关系，因为X 3仅在给定X 1的情况下出现X 3的概率
in the probability of X 3 given X 1 which is equal to 1 so nothing right ok

1584
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,120
等于1，所以没事好不好
in the probability of X 3 given X 1 which is equal to 1 so nothing right ok

1585
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,760
等于1，所以没事好不好
which is equal to 1 so nothing right ok nice

1586
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,560
好的，所以请记住要对此消除算法进行正式声明
which is equal to 1 so nothing right ok nice

1587
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:23,570
好的，所以请记住要对此消除算法进行正式声明


1588
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:29,570
好的，所以请记住要对此消除算法进行正式声明
all right so remember to web to this elimination algorithm to formally stated

1589
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:29,580
好的，所以请记住要对此消除算法进行正式声明
elimination algorithm to formally stated so let me this is sort of actually for

1590
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,420
所以让我说这实际上是出于装饰原因
elimination algorithm to formally stated so let me this is sort of actually for

1591
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:35,060
所以让我说这实际上是出于装饰原因
so let me this is sort of actually for decoration reasons this evidence

1592
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:35,070
所以让我说这实际上是出于装饰原因
decoration reasons this evidence potentials but because it's in the books

1593
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:37,070
潜力，但是因为它在书中，让我们谈谈它，所以您需要说
decoration reasons this evidence potentials but because it's in the books

1594
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:42,440
潜力，但是因为它在书中，让我们谈谈它，所以您需要说
potentials but because it's in the books let's talk about it so you need to say

1595
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:42,450
潜力，但是因为它在书中，让我们谈谈它，所以您需要说
let's talk about it so you need to say at least mathematically how we write

1596
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:44,140
至少在数学上，当某些节点时，我们如何写这些总和
let's talk about it so you need to say at least mathematically how we write

1597
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,580
至少在数学上，当某些节点时，我们如何写这些总和
at least mathematically how we write this summations when some of the nodes

1598
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:46,590
至少在数学上，当某些节点时，我们如何写这些总和
this summations when some of the nodes are logged out some particular values

1599
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:49,220
被注销了一些特定的值，我们将其表示为X条，因此它是一个
this summations when some of the nodes are logged out some particular values

1600
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:52,400
被注销了一些特定的值，我们将其表示为X条，因此它是一个
are logged out some particular values and we denote this as X bar so it's an

1601
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:52,410
被注销了一些特定的值，我们将其表示为X条，因此它是一个
and we denote this as X bar so it's an old I as a specific value we you know

1602
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:56,660
我将其作为特定值，我们将其称为X条，所以这是
and we denote this as X bar so it's an old I as a specific value we you know

1603
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:59,060
我将其作为特定值，我们将其称为X条，所以这是
old I as a specific value we you know this as X bar I all right so that's

1604
00:57:59,060 --> 00:57:59,070
我将其作为特定值，我们将其称为X条，所以这是
this as X bar I all right so that's evidence we have so that now basically

1605
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:01,490
我们有证据表明，现在基本上是只能将价值乘以
this as X bar I all right so that's evidence we have so that now basically

1606
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:04,160
我们有证据表明，现在基本上是只能将价值乘以
evidence we have so that now basically is can only take the value by the

1607
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:04,170
我们有证据表明，现在基本上是只能将价值乘以
is can only take the value by the evidence and cannot change so

1608
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:10,460
证据，不能改变
is can only take the value by the evidence and cannot change so

1609
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,180
因此，让我们看看我们如何以各种方式来证明这一证据
is can only take the value by the evidence and cannot change so

1610
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:12,190
因此，让我们看看我们如何以各种方式来证明这一证据


1611
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:19,349
因此，让我们看看我们如何以各种方式来证明这一证据
so so let's see how are we this evidence is going to come on the in various ways

1612
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:19,359
因此，让我们看看我们如何以各种方式来证明这一证据
is going to come on the in various ways on these estimations so let's say with

1613
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:26,220
根据这些估算值，让我们来说一下我们要计算的内容
is going to come on the in various ways on these estimations so let's say with

1614
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,250
根据这些估算值，让我们来说一下我们要计算的内容
on these estimations so let's say with what does it say that we want to compute

1615
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:28,260
根据这些估算值，让我们来说一下我们要计算的内容
what does it say that we want to compute P of x1 given the evidence exists okay

1616
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:33,109
给定证据表明x1的P存在，所以您知道我们观察到了滴答声，我们
what does it say that we want to compute P of x1 given the evidence exists okay

1617
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:36,299
给定证据表明x1的P存在，所以您知道我们观察到了滴答声，我们
P of x1 given the evidence exists okay so you know we observe that ticks and we

1618
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:36,309
给定证据表明x1的P存在，所以您知道我们观察到了滴答声，我们
so you know we observe that ticks and we won't find what's the condition of x1

1619
00:58:36,309 --> 00:58:38,039
给定x2，将无法找到x1的条件，因此显然可以做到这一点
so you know we observe that ticks and we won't find what's the condition of x1

1620
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:41,430
给定x2，将无法找到x1的条件，因此显然可以做到这一点
won't find what's the condition of x1 given x2 so obviously to do this

1621
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:41,440
给定x2，将无法找到x1的条件，因此显然可以做到这一点
given x2 so obviously to do this calculation we have to find the joint of

1622
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,230
计算我们必须找到X 1和X 6的关节，我将其写为关节
given x2 so obviously to do this calculation we have to find the joint of

1623
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:47,760
计算我们必须找到X 1和X 6的关节，我将其写为关节
calculation we have to find the joint of X 1 and X 6 and I write this as a joint

1624
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:47,770
计算我们必须找到X 1和X 6的关节，我将其写为关节
X 1 and X 6 and I write this as a joint event or X 6 you know this is prescribed

1625
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:50,339
事件或X 6，您知道这是规定的，所以当我猜相同的盘子时，
X 1 and X 6 and I write this as a joint event or X 6 you know this is prescribed

1626
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:54,390
事件或X 6，您知道这是规定的，所以当我猜相同的盘子时，
event or X 6 you know this is prescribed okay so when I guess the same plate by

1627
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:54,400
事件或X 6，您知道这是规定的，所以当我猜相同的盘子时，
okay so when I guess the same plate by pushing the summation of seen words in

1628
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,339
推动变量2 3 4 5中的所见单词的总和，但请注意
okay so when I guess the same plate by pushing the summation of seen words in

1629
00:58:56,339 --> 00:59:01,230
推动变量2 3 4 5中的所见单词的总和，但请注意
pushing the summation of seen words in the in the variables 2 3 4 5 but notice

1630
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:01,240
推动变量2 3 4 5中的所见单词的总和，但请注意
the in the variables 2 3 4 5 but notice on this conditional of X 6 given X 2 and

1631
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,140
在给定X 2和X 5的X 6的条件下，如果您具有
the in the variables 2 3 4 5 but notice on this conditional of X 6 given X 2 and

1632
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:08,160
在给定X 2和X 5的X 6的条件下，如果您具有
on this conditional of X 6 given X 2 and X 5 if you have this probability that

1633
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:08,170
在给定X 2和X 5的X 6的条件下，如果您具有
X 5 if you have this probability that corresponds basically to accessorize or

1634
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,740
基本上对应于配件或三维表的规范
X 5 if you have this probability that corresponds basically to accessorize or

1635
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:15,420
基本上对应于配件或三维表的规范
corresponds basically to accessorize or the third dimensional table the precept

1636
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:15,430
基本上对应于配件或三维表的规范
the third dimensional table the precept the X 16 take various values that say 0

1637
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:18,210
X 16会接受各种数值，说0和1正确无误，所以如果我给你
the third dimensional table the precept the X 16 take various values that say 0

1638
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:20,339
X 16会接受各种数值，说0和1正确无误，所以如果我给你
the X 16 take various values that say 0 and 1 clear right so if I give you the

1639
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:20,349
X 16会接受各种数值，说0和1正确无误，所以如果我给你
and 1 clear right so if I give you the next year next 6 the bar is 1 you're

1640
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:23,700
明年明年6酒吧为1，您将选择其中一个
and 1 clear right so if I give you the next year next 6 the bar is 1 you're

1641
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,170
明年明年6酒吧为1，您将选择其中一个
next year next 6 the bar is 1 you're going to take one of this slice of this

1642
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:25,180
明年明年6酒吧为1，您将选择其中一个
going to take one of this slice of this table all right so this is what this

1643
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,930
桌子好吧，这就是这意味着的意思，所以当你说的意思是X 5
going to take one of this slice of this table all right so this is what this

1644
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:32,359
桌子好吧，这就是这意味着的意思，所以当你说的意思是X 5
table all right so this is what this will imply so when you say mean X 5

1645
00:59:32,359 --> 00:59:32,369
桌子好吧，这就是这意味着的意思，所以当你说的意思是X 5
will imply so when you say mean X 5 you're going to define a potential 3 X 5

1646
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:35,309
您将要定义一个3 X 5的电位，剩下的山谷将是X 2，
will imply so when you say mean X 5 you're going to define a potential 3 X 5

1647
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:37,470
您将要定义一个3 X 5的电位，剩下的山谷将是X 2，
you're going to define a potential 3 X 5 and the valley was left will be X 2 and

1648
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:37,480
您将要定义一个3 X 5的电位，剩下的山谷将是X 2，
and the valley was left will be X 2 and X 3 all right then you have to sum 1 X 4

1649
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,890
X 3好，那么您必须求和1 X 4，所以这些是唯一的变量
and the valley was left will be X 2 and X 3 all right then you have to sum 1 X 4

1650
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:43,019
X 3好，那么您必须求和1 X 4，所以这些是唯一的变量
X 3 all right then you have to sum 1 X 4 so these are the only variables that

1651
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:43,029
X 3好，那么您必须求和1 X 4，所以这些是唯一的变量
so these are the only variables that involve X fourth I'm sorry queries

1652
00:59:43,029 --> 00:59:45,510
涉及X第四，我很抱歉现在查询剧院，所以这种潜力
so these are the only variables that involve X fourth I'm sorry queries

1653
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:48,390
涉及X第四，我很抱歉现在查询剧院，所以这种潜力
involve X fourth I'm sorry queries theater now actually so this potential

1654
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:48,400
涉及X第四，我很抱歉现在查询剧院，所以这种潜力
theater now actually so this potential is outside the summation right I left it

1655
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,329
在求和权的右边，所以我把它留在右边，因为从特定的
theater now actually so this potential is outside the summation right I left it

1656
00:59:51,329 --> 00:59:54,660
在求和权的右边，所以我把它留在右边，因为从特定的
is outside the summation right I left it to the right because from the particular

1657
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:54,670
在求和权的右边，所以我把它留在右边，因为从特定的
to the right because from the particular reason so I saw an X for this equal to 1

1658
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:58,130
原因，所以我看到这个等于1的X，那么我必须召集极端
to the right because from the particular reason so I saw an X for this equal to 1

1659
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,559
原因，所以我看到这个等于1的X，那么我必须召集极端
reason so I saw an X for this equal to 1 then I have to summon extreme this

1660
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:01,569
原因，所以我看到这个等于1的X，那么我必须召集极端
then I have to summon extreme this potential depends on X 3 okay so I have

1661
01:00:01,569 --> 01:00:06,809
电位取决于X 3好的，所以我有最差的两个术语的意思，所以它
then I have to summon extreme this potential depends on X 3 okay so I have

1662
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:08,490
电位取决于X 3好的，所以我有最差的两个术语的意思，所以它
potential depends on X 3 okay so I have the point of the worst two terms so it

1663
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:08,500
电位取决于X 3好的，所以我有最差的两个术语的意思，所以它
the point of the worst two terms so it will be a new potential 3 X 3 of X 1 and

1664
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,500
将是X 1和X 2的新势3 X 3，然后我必须求和1 X 2和
the point of the worst two terms so it will be a new potential 3 X 3 of X 1 and

1665
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:15,180
将是X 1和X 2的新势3 X 3，然后我必须求和1 X 2和
will be a new potential 3 X 3 of X 1 and X 2 and and then I have to sum 1 X 2 and

1666
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:15,190
将是X 1和X 2的新势3 X 3，然后我必须求和1 X 2和
X 2 and and then I have to sum 1 X 2 and I have the product of two potentials and

1667
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:16,950
我有两个潜力的乘积，并且这是有条件的，我基本上得到
X 2 and and then I have to sum 1 X 2 and I have the product of two potentials and

1668
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:19,319
我有两个潜力的乘积，并且这是有条件的，我基本上得到
I have the product of two potentials and this conditional and I get basically a

1669
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:19,329
我有两个潜力的乘积，并且这是有条件的，我基本上得到
this conditional and I get basically a new potential which is V X 2 and the

1670
01:00:19,329 --> 01:00:21,839
新的潜力是VX 2，剩下的唯一变量是
this conditional and I get basically a new potential which is V X 2 and the

1671
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:22,779
新的潜力是VX 2，剩下的唯一变量是
new potential which is V X 2 and the only variable left is

1672
01:00:22,779 --> 01:00:22,789
新的潜力是VX 2，剩下的唯一变量是
only variable left is Swan and if you so this is the joint

1673
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:28,719
天鹅，如果您愿意，这是联合的权利，如果您需要有条件的话
only variable left is Swan and if you so this is the joint

1674
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:32,049
天鹅，如果您愿意，这是联合的权利，如果您需要有条件的话
Swan and if you so this is the joint alright and if you want the conditional

1675
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:32,059
天鹅，如果您愿意，这是联合的权利，如果您需要有条件的话
alright and if you want the conditional given the evidence x6 bar is basically

1676
01:00:32,059 --> 01:00:35,259
给定证据x6条基本上是最终结果
alright and if you want the conditional given the evidence x6 bar is basically

1677
01:00:35,259 --> 01:00:37,829
给定证据x6条基本上是最终结果
given the evidence x6 bar is basically this is the final result

1678
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:37,839
给定证据x6条基本上是最终结果
this is the final result okay so so this is sort of a way one of

1679
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:46,299
好的，所以这是一种通过以下方式计算证据的方式之一
this is the final result okay so so this is sort of a way one of

1680
01:00:46,299 --> 01:00:48,729
好的，所以这是一种通过以下方式计算证据的方式之一
okay so so this is sort of a way one of the ways to calculate the evidence by

1681
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:48,739
好的，所以这是一种通过以下方式计算证据的方式之一
the ways to calculate the evidence by taking slices of this table okay

1682
01:00:48,739 --> 01:00:54,009
把这张桌子切成薄片好吧，您不需要这个唯一的方法
the ways to calculate the evidence by taking slices of this table okay

1683
01:00:54,009 --> 01:00:57,699
把这张桌子切成薄片好吧，您不需要这个唯一的方法
taking slices of this table okay you don't need this the only way that

1684
01:00:57,699 --> 01:00:57,709
把这张桌子切成薄片好吧，您不需要这个唯一的方法
you don't need this the only way that you can account for evidence is using

1685
01:00:57,709 --> 01:01:00,699
您可以说明证据是使用圆圈Delta函数好吗，所以这句话
you don't need this the only way that you can account for evidence is using

1686
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:04,419
您可以说明证据是使用圆圈Delta函数好吗，所以这句话
you can account for evidence is using circle Delta function okay so the adage

1687
01:01:04,419 --> 01:01:04,429
您可以说明证据是使用圆圈Delta函数好吗，所以这句话
circle Delta function okay so the adage sort of power to reveal a good thing you

1688
01:01:04,429 --> 01:01:06,370
可以通过这种方式揭示您曾经编程过的美好事物的力量，但可以说
circle Delta function okay so the adage sort of power to reveal a good thing you

1689
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,620
可以通过这种方式揭示您曾经编程过的美好事物的力量，但可以说
sort of power to reveal a good thing you ever program it this way but let's say

1690
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:08,630
可以通过这种方式揭示您曾经编程过的美好事物的力量，但可以说
ever program it this way but let's say rather some node if you give it the

1691
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:12,370
而不是某个节点，如果您赋予它值，那么您正在尝试的是
ever program it this way but let's say rather some node if you give it the

1692
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:14,679
而不是某个节点，如果您赋予它值，那么您正在尝试的是
rather some node if you give it the value so what you do is you are trying

1693
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:14,689
而不是某个节点，如果您赋予它值，那么您正在尝试的是
value so what you do is you are trying to that node a potential that you can

1694
01:01:14,689 --> 01:01:17,650
到那个节点，您可以证明其潜力的潜力，并且该潜力是
value so what you do is you are trying to that node a potential that you can

1695
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:20,019
到那个节点，您可以证明其潜力的潜力，并且该潜力是
to that node a potential that you can evidence potential and that potential is

1696
01:01:20,019 --> 01:01:20,029
到那个节点，您可以证明其潜力的潜力，并且该潜力是
evidence potential and that potential is a function do the observable of a

1697
01:01:20,029 --> 01:01:35,499
一个功能可以观察到从中选择切片
evidence potential and that potential is a function do the observable of a

01:01:35,499 --> 01:01:36,999
一个功能可以观察到从中选择切片
a function do the observable of a selection of the slice from that

1699
01:01:36,999 --> 01:01:37,009
一个功能可以观察到从中选择切片
selection of the slice from that conditional distribution without doing

1700
01:01:37,009 --> 01:01:39,009
有条件的分布而没有进行显式显示

conditional distribution without doing it sort of explicit to show for example

1702
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:43,089
有条件的分布而没有进行显式显示
it sort of explicit to show for example if you want to write the probability

1703
01:01:43,089 --> 01:01:46,029
如果您想写下几率，可以说我们知道
it sort of explicit to show for example if you want to write the probability

1704
01:01:46,029 --> 01:01:51,269
如果您想写下几率，可以说我们知道
if you want to write the probability let's say of let's say we have you know

1705
01:01:51,269 --> 01:01:51,279
如果您想写下几率，可以说我们知道
let's say of let's say we have you know this probability of x given X 2 and X 5

1706
01:01:51,279 --> 01:01:55,449
给定X 2和X 5的x的概率，所以使用此证据
let's say of let's say we have you know this probability of x given X 2 and X 5

1707
01:01:55,449 --> 01:02:00,459
给定X 2和X 5的x的概率，所以使用此证据
this probability of x given X 2 and X 5 all right so using this evidence

1708
01:02:00,459 --> 01:02:00,469
给定X 2和X 5的x的概率，所以使用此证据
all right so using this evidence potential for now the 6 because the node

1709
01:02:00,469 --> 01:02:03,549
因为节点X 6紧贴此值，所以现在有6的潜力，您可以使用此值
all right so using this evidence potential for now the 6 because the node

1710
01:02:03,549 --> 01:02:06,669
因为节点X 6紧贴此值，所以现在有6的潜力，您可以使用此值
potential for now the 6 because the node X 6 is clung to this value you use this

1711
01:02:06,669 --> 01:02:06,679
因为节点X 6紧贴此值，所以现在有6的潜力，您可以使用此值
X 6 is clung to this value you use this potential and you say when someone at 6

1712
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:09,549
潜力，你说当某人在6时，显然4 X 6的总和
X 6 is clung to this value you use this potential and you say when someone at 6

1713
01:02:09,549 --> 01:02:12,309
潜力，你说当某人在6时，显然4 X 6的总和
potential and you say when someone at 6 and obviously this summation 4 X 6 will

1714
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:12,319
潜力，你说当某人在6时，显然4 X 6的总和
and obviously this summation 4 X 6 will give you an exit bar right because

1715
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:15,849
给您一个退出栏的权利，因为这是6可以取的唯一值
and obviously this summation 4 X 6 will give you an exit bar right because

1716
01:02:15,849 --> 01:02:18,449
给您一个退出栏的权利，因为这是6可以取的唯一值
give you an exit bar right because that's the only value of 6 can take

1717
01:02:18,449 --> 01:02:18,459
给您一个退出栏的权利，因为这是6可以取的唯一值
that's the only value of 6 can take usually programming like this but you

1718
01:02:18,459 --> 01:02:20,829
通常像这样编程，但是您知道有点想用它编写
that's the only value of 6 can take usually programming like this but you

1719
01:02:20,829 --> 01:02:25,100
通常像这样编程，但是您知道有点想用它编写
usually programming like this but you know sort of want to write it in in

1720
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:25,110
通常像这样编程，但是您知道有点想用它编写
know sort of want to write it in in in in a generic way mathematical you can

1721
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:28,100
用数学的通用方式，您可以说提供商已经给了
know sort of want to write it in in in in a generic way mathematical you can

1722
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,990
用数学的通用方式，您可以说提供商已经给了
in in a generic way mathematical you can say the providers have given have

1723
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:30,000
用数学的通用方式，您可以说提供商已经给了
say the providers have given have married assigning an evidence potential

1724
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,510
已婚人士除具备以下条件外，还分配了潜在的证据
say the providers have given have married assigning an evidence potential

1725
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:34,660
已婚人士除具备以下条件外，还分配了潜在的证据

1726
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:34,670
已婚人士除具备以下条件外，还分配了潜在的证据
in addition to the condition of distributions so when you write the

1727
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:36,980
分布，因此当您编写分布时，图形的焦点便是
in addition to the condition of distributions so when you write the

1728
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:40,100
分布，因此当您编写分布时，图形的焦点便是
distributions so when you write the distribution the focus of the graph you

1729
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:40,110
分布，因此当您编写分布时，图形的焦点便是
distribution the focus of the graph you also multiplied with the saboteurs

1730
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:41,780
也基本上从其他方面乘以破坏者的潜能
distribution the focus of the graph you also multiplied with the saboteurs

1731
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:44,120
也基本上从其他方面乘以破坏者的潜能
also multiplied with the saboteurs potentials from the rest basically in

1732
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:44,130

potentials from the rest basically in the elimination algorithm is exactly is

1733
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:45,950
消除算法恰好是以前的，它们基本上是我
potentials from the rest basically in the elimination algorithm is exactly is

1734
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:52,880
消除算法恰好是以前的，它们基本上是我
the elimination algorithm is exactly is before and they're basically I

1735
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:52,890
消除算法恰好是以前的，它们基本上是我
before and they're basically I generalized this with disturb this

1736
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:55,190
泛化了这一点，扰乱了这种保护
before and they're basically I generalized this with disturb this

1737
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:56,060
泛化了这一点，扰乱了这种保护
generalized this with disturb this protection

1738
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:56,070
泛化了这一点，扰乱了这种保护
protection all right so change the algorithm the

1739
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:00,080
好的，所以改变算法，消除算法，并指示
protection all right so change the algorithm the

1740
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,880
好的，所以改变算法，消除算法，并指示
all right so change the algorithm the elimination algorithm and directed

1741
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:01,890
好的，所以改变算法，消除算法，并指示
elimination algorithm and directed graphs so you have a graph G with

1742
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:04,600
图，所以你有一个图G，其中T确实存在，让我看看
elimination algorithm and directed graphs so you have a graph G with

1743
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:11,240
图，所以你有一个图G，其中T确实存在，让我看看
graphs so you have a graph G with evidence T actually exists let me see

1744
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:11,380
证据是证据节点也是计划节点的工作
graphs so you have a graph G with evidence T actually exists let me see

01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:11,390
证据是证据节点也是计划节点的工作


1746
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:17,290
证据是证据节点也是计划节点的工作
so is the evidence yes the evidence nodes an effort of the planning node

1747
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:17,300
证据是证据节点也是计划节点的工作
nodes an effort of the planning node okay so using Jordans notation here so

1748
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:22,540
好的，所以在这里使用Jordans表示法，所以您需要做的是
nodes an effort of the planning node okay so using Jordans notation here so

1749
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:25,060
好的，所以在这里使用Jordans表示法，所以您需要做的是
okay so using Jordans notation here so so what you need to do is you need to

1750
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:25,070
好的，所以在这里使用Jordans表示法，所以您需要做的是
so what you need to do is you need to initialize the graph okay basically yeah

1751
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:30,470
初始化图表好吧，基本上是好的，是要了解潜力
so what you need to do is you need to initialize the graph okay basically yeah

1752
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:33,320
初始化图表好吧，基本上是好的，是要了解潜力
initialize the graph okay basically yeah the good is to understand the potentials

1753
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:33,330
初始化图表好吧，基本上是好的，是要了解潜力
the good is to understand the potentials that you have if you need to introduce

1754
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:35,510
如果需要引入证据，则说明节点已规定
the good is to understand the potentials that you have if you need to introduce

1755
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:37,550
如果需要引入证据，则说明节点已规定
that you have if you need to introduce the evidence what nodes have prescribed

1756
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:37,560
如果需要引入证据，则说明节点已规定
the evidence what nodes have prescribed values and sort of you know the

1757
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,730
值和您了解我们讨论过的功能，如果
the evidence what nodes have prescribed values and sort of you know the

1758
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:47,480
值和您了解我们讨论过的功能，如果
values and sort of you know the functions that we discussed it then if

1759
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:47,490
值和您了解我们讨论过的功能，如果
functions that we discussed it then if you need to update the graph given the

1760
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,870
您需要根据证据来更新图表，因此基本上我会假设
functions that we discussed it then if you need to update the graph given the

1761
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:53,150
您需要根据证据来更新图表，因此基本上我会假设
you need to update the graph given the evidence so basically I will assume that

1762
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:53,160
您需要根据证据来更新图表，因此基本上我会假设
evidence so basically I will assume that see the next slide this is where this

with so this is the click the clickers is of size Q minus 1 the thing which we

1978
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:45,500
大小为Q减去1我们定义为等于1的事物
with so this is the click the clickers is of size Q minus 1 the thing which we

1979
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,590
大小为Q减去1我们定义为等于1的事物
is of size Q minus 1 the thing which we defined to be equal to 1

1980
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:49,240

know take something more complicated take something here you know you know

1989
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:04,110
知道做些更复杂的事在这里做些事你知道你知道
take something here you know you know how many you know how many things we

1990
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:07,430
有多少你知道我们需要消除多少东西，所以如果你尝试
take something here you know you know how many you know how many things we

将消除
something in sequence so let's see which will eliminate

1997
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:22,750
我的意思是认为这件事上下起伏不定，所以这是一个
something in sequence so let's see which will eliminate

1998
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:22,760
我的意思是认为这件事上下起伏不定，所以这是一个


1999
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,800

I mean consider that this thing goes up and downs right so it is a

2000
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:26,810
我的意思是认为这件事上下起伏不定，所以这是一个
and downs right so it is a two-dimensional graph looking like that

2001
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:29,260
看起来像这样的二维图，没关系，让我们集中精力
and downs right so it is a two-dimensional graph looking like that

2002
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,600
看起来像这样的二维图，没关系，让我们集中精力
two-dimensional graph looking like that so it doesn't matter let's concentrate

2003
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:31,610
看起来像这样的二维图，没关系，让我们集中精力
so it doesn't matter let's concentrate on this on this node and let's say we

2004
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:33,790
在这个节点上，假设我们已经消除了这个，那么多少
so it doesn't matter let's concentrate on this on this node and let's say we

2005
01:12:33,790 --> 01:12:37,660
在这个节点上，假设我们已经消除了这个，那么多少
on this on this node and let's say we have eliminated this so how many how

2006
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:37,670
在这个节点上，假设我们已经消除了这个，那么多少
have eliminated this so how many how many potentials how many vegetables

01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:39,990
有很多潜力，有多少蔬菜可以消灭，什么是消灭
have eliminated this so how many how many potentials how many vegetables

2008
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:42,310
有很多潜力，有多少蔬菜可以消灭，什么是消灭
many potentials how many vegetables where eliminate what is the elimination

2009
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:42,320
有很多潜力，有多少蔬菜可以消灭，什么是消灭
where eliminate what is the elimination click where the summation is going to

2010
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,860
单击求和将在何处进行操作将涉及多少个节点
where eliminate what is the elimination click where the summation is going to

2011
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:48,970
单击求和将在何处进行操作将涉及多少个节点
click where the summation is going to operate how many nodes will involve

2012
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:48,980
单击求和将在何处进行操作将涉及多少个节点
operate how many nodes will involve let's say this now we assume this

2013
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:51,640
假设现在假设我们已经将其消除了
operate how many nodes will involve let's say this now we assume this

2014
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:55,180
假设现在假设我们已经将其消除了
let's say this now we assume this already we eliminate it to the right how

2015
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:55,190
假设现在假设我们已经将其消除了
already we eliminate it to the right how many how many 3 so 3 minus 1 so the 3

2016
01:12:55,190 --> 01:13:04,690
3 3 3减1所以3的宽度是2
already we eliminate it to the right how many how many 3 so 3 minus 1 so the 3

2017
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:08,410
3 3 3减1所以3的宽度是2
many how many 3 so 3 minus 1 so the 3 width is 2 and the chatter a more

2018
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:08,420
3 3 3减1所以3的宽度是2
width is 2 and the chatter a more complicated case

2019
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:10,170
复杂的案件，所以很明显，如果每个人
width is 2 and the chatter a more complicated case

2020
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:18,160
复杂的案件，所以很明显，如果每个人
complicated case so obviously the nation's if everybody

2021
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:18,170
复杂的案件，所以很明显，如果每个人
so obviously the nation's if everybody both can take K values the cost of every

2022
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:21,700
两者都可以取K值，每个通知的成本k2 w加1不能使用3
so obviously the nation's if everybody both can take K values the cost of every

2023
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:24,610
两者都可以取K值，每个通知的成本k2 w加1不能使用3
both can take K values the cost of every notice k2 w plus 1 could not use the 3

2024
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:24,620
两者都可以取K值，每个通知的成本k2 w加1不能使用3
notice k2 w plus 1 could not use the 3 wait and then times V this gives you the

2025
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:27,670
等待，然后乘以V，如果没有，则为您提供计算顺序
notice k2 w plus 1 could not use the 3 wait and then times V this gives you the

2026
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:32,440
等待，然后乘以V，如果没有，则为您提供计算顺序
wait and then times V this gives you the order of the calculation if you didn't

2027
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:32,450
等待，然后乘以V，如果没有，则为您提供计算顺序
order of the calculation if you didn't give elimination I would basically the

2028
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:34,060
给消除，我基本上成本将是K等于D的幂
order of the calculation if you didn't give elimination I would basically the

2029
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:36,490
给消除，我基本上成本将是K等于D的幂
give elimination I would basically the cost would be K to the power D all right

2030
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:36,500
给消除，我基本上成本将是K等于D的幂
cost would be K to the power D all right D is the total number of nodes so

2031
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,590
D是节点的总数，因此很明显，它在V中是线性的，所以它是V
cost would be K to the power D all right D is the total number of nodes so

2032
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:41,140
D是节点的总数，因此很明显，它在V中是线性的，所以它是V
D is the total number of nodes so obviously this is linear in V so it's V

2033
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:41,150
D是节点的总数，因此很明显，它在V中是线性的，所以它是V
obviously this is linear in V so it's V times K 2w plus 1

2034
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,030
乘以K 2w加1等等很多东西
obviously this is linear in V so it's V times K 2w plus 1

2035
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:44,770
乘以K 2w加1等等很多东西
times K 2w plus 1 and lots of kinds of things so many

2036
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:44,780
乘以K 2w加1等等很多东西
and lots of kinds of things so many lectures we think with the plus 1

2037
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:46,360
我们认为加号1的讲座，因为您知道12岁大了1
and lots of kinds of things so many lectures we think with the plus 1

2038
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,480
我们认为加号1的讲座，因为您知道12岁大了1
lectures we think with the plus 1 because you know 12 years big the 1

2039
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:49,490
我们认为加号1的讲座，因为您知道12岁大了1
because you know 12 years big the 1 doesn't make much difference but this is

2040
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:52,090
并没有太大的区别，但这是正确的路线列表的一种
because you know 12 years big the 1 doesn't make much difference but this is

2041
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:56,860
并没有太大的区别，但这是正确的路线列表的一种
doesn't make much difference but this is the sort of the correct route list okay

2042
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:57,700
因此，最好的是在无向图的背景下，我提到了我们
doesn't make much difference but this is the sort of the correct route list okay

2044
01:13:57,710 --> 01:14:07,120
因此，最好的是在无向图的背景下，我提到了我们
so the best and in the context of undirected graphs okay I mentioned we

2045
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:07,130
因此，最好的是在无向图的背景下，我提到了我们

01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:59,049
发挥这种潜力，这就是您所相信的
get this potential this is what you believe this

2126
01:16:59,049 --> 01:16:59,059
发挥这种潜力，这就是您所相信的
believe this this conditional distribution and it is

2127
01:16:59,059 --> 01:17:02,379
这种有条件的分布，这就是我们要做的，这样橇就可以
believe this this conditional distribution and it is

2128
01:17:02,379 --> 01:17:04,930
这种有条件的分布，这就是我们要做的，这样橇就可以
this conditional distribution and it is what we're gonna do is so the skids can

2129
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:04,940
这种有条件的分布，这就是我们要做的，这样橇就可以
what we're gonna do is so the skids can invade the room where the stress in

2130
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:08,589
入侵压力在起作用的房间，然后我们将合并
what we're gonna do is so the skids can invade the room where the stress in

2131
01:17:08,589 --> 01:17:10,750
入侵压力在起作用的房间，然后我们将合并
invade the room where the stress in action and then we are going to merge

2132
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:10,760
入侵压力在起作用的房间，然后我们将合并
action and then we are going to merge the two algorithms and give you sort of

2133
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,850
两种算法，并为您提供了一种基于图论的方法
action and then we are going to merge the two algorithms and give you sort of

2134
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:15,069
两种算法，并为您提供了一种基于图论的方法
the two algorithms and give you sort of a graph theoretic approach with

2135
01:17:15,069 --> 01:17:15,079
两种算法，并为您提供了一种基于图论的方法
a graph theoretic approach with elimination of cliques but we'll do the

2136
01:17:15,079 --> 01:17:17,830
消除集团，但我们会消除它，所以您实际上并不会
a graph theoretic approach with elimination of cliques but we'll do the

2137
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:19,299
消除集团，但我们会消除它，所以您实际上并不会
elimination of cliques but we'll do the elimination of it so you don't really

2138
01:17:19,299 --> 01:17:19,309
消除集团，但我们会消除它，所以您实际上并不会
elimination of it so you don't really have to say division of variables but

2139
01:17:19,309 --> 01:17:22,180
不得不说变量的除法，但基本上你一直在消除
elimination of it so you don't really have to say division of variables but

2140
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:24,520
不得不说变量的除法，但基本上你一直在消除
have to say division of variables but basically you've been at eliminating

2141
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:24,530
不得不说变量的除法，但基本上你一直在消除
basically you've been at eliminating nodes one at the same time deprived of

2142
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:27,640
一个节点同时被剥夺了点击次数，并且也消除了
basically you've been at eliminating nodes one at the same time deprived of

2143
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,529
一个节点同时被剥夺了点击次数，并且也消除了
nodes one at the same time deprived of the clicks for this and also eliminated

2144
01:17:29,529 --> 01:17:29,539
一个节点同时被剥夺了点击次数，并且也消除了
the clicks for this and also eliminated there will be some marriage with some

2145
01:17:29,539 --> 01:17:33,100
将会发生一些婚姻，并在某些组织过程中发生
the clicks for this and also eliminated there will be some marriage with some

2146
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,720
将会发生一些婚姻，并在某些组织过程中发生
there will be some marriage with some organization process happening in the

2147
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:34,730
将会发生一些婚姻，并在某些组织过程中发生
organization process happening in the process and some other weird things but

2148
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:36,339
过程和其他一些奇怪的事情，但它们都是理论方法
organization process happening in the process and some other weird things but

2149
01:17:36,339 --> 01:17:38,529
过程和其他一些奇怪的事情，但它们都是理论方法
process and some other weird things but they will all be theoretical approaches

2150
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:38,539
过程和其他一些奇怪的事情，但它们都是理论方法
they will all be theoretical approaches so will be operations on the graph not

2151
01:17:38,539 --> 01:17:40,810
所以图表上的运算将不再存在于分布中了
they will all be theoretical approaches so will be operations on the graph not

2152
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:42,669
所以图表上的运算将不再存在于分布中了
so will be operations on the graph not in the distribution anymore okay

2153
01:17:42,669 --> 01:17:42,679
所以图表上的运算将不再存在于分布中了
in the distribution anymore okay so actually so you can do it you can be

2154
01:17:42,679 --> 01:17:45,549
所以实际上，所以你可以做到，你可以领先我，我会说记住你
in the distribution anymore okay so actually so you can do it you can be

2155
01:17:45,549 --> 01:17:51,750
所以实际上，所以你可以做到，你可以领先我，我会说记住你
so actually so you can do it you can be ahead of me and I will say remember you

2156
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:51,760
所以实际上，所以你可以做到，你可以领先我，我会说记住你
ahead of me and I will say remember you sometime in the very near future

2157
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,919
在不久的将来的某个时间还可以，所以对于前者的任何情况
ahead of me and I will say remember you sometime in the very near future

2158
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:56,339
在不久的将来的某个时间还可以，所以对于前者的任何情况
sometime in the very near future okay so for any conditions in the former

2159
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:56,349
在不久的将来的某个时间还可以，所以对于前者的任何情况
okay so for any conditions in the former Rubick

2160
01:17:56,349 --> 01:17:59,349
鲁比克
okay so for any conditions in the former Rubick
