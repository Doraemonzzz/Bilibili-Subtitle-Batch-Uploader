00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,230
第二步，当您召集证据时，您也将其放在活动列表中
second step when you call evidence you also put in the active list this

126
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
第二步，当您召集证据时，您也将其放在活动列表中
also put in the active list this evidence functions which were nothing

127
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,570
别无其他的证据功能代表了当然的功能
also put in the active list this evidence functions which were nothing

128
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,190
别无其他的证据功能代表了当然的功能
evidence functions which were nothing else present the functions of course

129
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,200
别无其他的证据功能代表了当然的功能
else present the functions of course this variable to take value five let's

130
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,010
这个变量取值为5，我们说对了，所以您实际上并不需要
else present the functions of course this variable to take value five let's

131
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,000
这个变量取值为5，我们说对了，所以您实际上并不需要
this variable to take value five let's say right so so you don't really need to

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,010
这个变量取值为5，我们说对了，所以您实际上并不需要
say right so so you don't really need to have it explicitly but conceptualize

133
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,830
有明确的说明，但将其概念化，这需要放在某个地方，因此，如果
say right so so you don't really need to have it explicitly but conceptualize

134
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,710
有明确的说明，但将其概念化，这需要放在某个地方，因此，如果
have it explicitly but conceptualize this this needs to come somewhere so if

135
00:05:59,710 --> 00:05:59,720
有明确的说明，但将其概念化，这需要放在某个地方，因此，如果
this this needs to come somewhere so if you want it just a formal presentation

136
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,650
您只需要一个正式的演示文稿，基本上就需要提供此证据
this this needs to come somewhere so if you want it just a formal presentation

137
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,510
您只需要一个正式的演示文稿，基本上就需要提供此证据
you want it just a formal presentation basically you need to put this evidence

138
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:06,520
您只需要一个正式的演示文稿，基本上就需要提供此证据
basically you need to put this evidence function right in the active list in

139
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,310
在此潜在条件版本中的活动列表中具有正确的功能
basically you need to put this evidence function right in the active list in

140
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,190
在此潜在条件版本中的活动列表中具有正确的功能
function right in the active list in editions of this condition of potential

141
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:11,200
在此潜在条件版本中的活动列表中具有正确的功能
editions of this condition of potential okay and then following your elimination

142
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,730
好，然后按照您的消除方法或您需要做的是
editions of this condition of potential okay and then following your elimination

143
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,580
好，然后按照您的消除方法或您需要做的是
okay and then following your elimination or the what you need to do is you have

144
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:18,590
好，然后按照您的消除方法或您需要做的是
or the what you need to do is you have to go to every node X I following hot or

145
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,360
转到热或干之后的每个节点XI，您必须找到所有
or the what you need to do is you have to go to every node X I following hot or

146
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,610
转到热或干之后的每个节点XI，您必须找到所有
to go to every node X I following hot or dry and you have to find all the

147
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:24,620
转到热或干之后的每个节点XI，您必须找到所有
dry and you have to find all the potentials the depend on X high alright

148
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,570
电位取决于X高，所以基本上这将是证据
dry and you have to find all the potentials the depend on X high alright

149
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,080
电位取决于X高，所以基本上这将是证据

159
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:50,870
选出我，然后形成一个新的潜力，我们称其为XI，然后放置
which we call it the X I and then place this potential in the activity and all

160
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,890
活动中的这种潜力以及所有其他潜在的潜力

introduced that involve its I will be removed from

165
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479
介绍涉及它我将被删除
that involve its I will be removed from the after this okay so you'll be sucked

166
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,540
好的之后，您将被效果I和最后的效果所吸引
that involve its I will be removed from the after this okay so you'll be sucked

you know let's see X 6 is fixed to this value

298
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,600
值还可以，但我相信您会在我注意到时
you know let's see X 6 is fixed to this value

299
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,340
值还可以，但我相信您会在我注意到时
value okay but I believe you notice when I

300
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:11,350
值还可以，但我相信您会在我注意到时
okay but I believe you notice when I guess this Lent the function the idea is

301
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,830
猜猜这借了功能的想法将要使用您的渲染功能
okay but I believe you notice when I guess this Lent the function the idea is

302
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,420
猜猜这借了功能的想法将要使用您的渲染功能
guess this Lent the function the idea is going to use the render function you

303
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:15,430
猜猜这借了功能的想法将要使用您的渲染功能
going to use the render function you will have to sound 1x6 right so when you

304
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,970
将必须正确听起来1x6，所以当您为X的所有可能值发出声音时，
going to use the render function you will have to sound 1x6 right so when you

305
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,800
将必须正确听起来1x6，所以当您为X的所有可能值发出声音时，
will have to sound 1x6 right so when you sound for all possible values of X takes

306
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:19,810
将必须正确听起来1x6，所以当您为X的所有可能值发出声音时，
sound for all possible values of X takes only when you hit this X bar six this

307
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,070
仅当您击中该X竖线6时，该值将为非零，因此其余值为非零
sound for all possible values of X takes only when you hit this X bar six this

308
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,170
仅当您击中该X竖线6时，该值将为非零，因此其余值为非零
only when you hit this X bar six this would be nonzero so the rest is non zero

309
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:25,180
仅当您击中该X竖线6时，该值将为非零，因此其余值为非零
would be nonzero so the rest is non zero so this summation sort of gets you only

310
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,080
因此，这种求和方式只能使您获得与此条形对应的一个值
would be nonzero so the rest is non zero so this summation sort of gets you only

311
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,850
因此，这种求和方式只能使您获得与此条形对应的一个值
so this summation sort of gets you only one value corresponding to this bar

312
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:29,860
因此，这种求和方式只能使您获得与此条形对应的一个值
one value corresponding to this bar value there okay so so the summation X 6

313
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,800
值在那里好，所以总和X 6不是我已经在第二行中输入的值
one value corresponding to this bar value there okay so so the summation X 6

314
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,960
值在那里好，所以总和X 6不是我已经在第二行中输入的值
value there okay so so the summation X 6 is not some of the second line I already

315
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:36,970
值在那里好，所以总和X 6不是我已经在第二行中输入的值
is not some of the second line I already put the evidence here and then I have to

Delta X 6 X has some specific body choice of no interest is X 2 X 3 all

333
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:12,820
Delta X 6 X有一些特定的身体选择，没有兴趣的是X 2 X 3全部
choice of no interest is X 2 X 3 all right so this doesn't involve any

334
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,090
对，所以当我进行求和时，这不涉及任何表达式
choice of no interest is X 2 X 3 all right so this doesn't involve any

335
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,650
对，所以当我进行求和时，这不涉及任何表达式
right so this doesn't involve any expression when I do the summation and

336
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:16,660
对，所以当我进行求和时，这不涉及任何表达式
expression when I do the summation and export is exactly this before I get

337
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,080
出口正是这种情况，之后我又有另一种潜在的恐惧去探索
expression when I do the summation and export is exactly this before I get

338
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,030
出口正是这种情况，之后我又有另一种潜在的恐惧去探索
export is exactly this before I get another potential fear of explore the

339
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
出口正是这种情况，之后我又有另一种潜在的恐惧去探索
another potential fear of explore the defense on your legs to then I have to

340
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,310
防守，然后我必须在X 3中解决该产品，然后我
another potential fear of explore the defense on your legs to then I have to

341
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,890
防守，然后我必须在X 3中解决该产品，然后我
defense on your legs to then I have to solve this product in X 3 and then I

342
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:25,900
防守，然后我必须在X 3中解决该产品，然后我
solve this product in X 3 and then I have to sum everything in X 2 this is

343
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,950
必须将X 2中的所有内容相加，这是归一化因子，所以当
solve this product in X 3 and then I have to sum everything in X 2 this is

344
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,080
必须将X 2中的所有内容相加，这是归一化因子，所以当
have to sum everything in X 2 this is the normalization factor right so when

345
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,090
必须将X 2中的所有内容相加，这是归一化因子，所以当
the normalization factor right so when we write it like that the distribution

346
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,030
我们这样写，即分布被归一化，所以我们必须放一些
the normalization factor right so when we write it like that the distribution

347
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,090
我们这样写，即分布被归一化，所以我们必须放一些
we write it like that the distribution is normalized so we have to put some

348
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:36,100
我们这样写，即分布被归一化，所以我们必须放一些
is normalized so we have to put some normalization factor and effectively if

349
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,780
归一化因子，如果要查找条件写则有效
is normalized so we have to put some normalization factor and effectively if

00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,940
归一化因子，如果要查找条件写则有效
normalization factor and effectively if you want to find the conditional write

351
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:41,950
归一化因子，如果要查找条件写则有效
you want to find the conditional write once you compute this in the condition

352
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,730
一旦您在条件中计算出此值，它就会与之成比例，因此您可以
you want to find the conditional write once you compute this in the condition

353
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,350
一旦您在条件中计算出此值，它就会与之成比例，因此您可以
once you compute this in the condition will be proportional to that so you can

354
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:46,360
一旦您在条件中计算出此值，它就会与之成比例，因此您可以
will be proportional to that so you can normalize by summing this potential

355
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,990
通过将所有潜在值的潜在期间视图相加来归一化
will be proportional to that so you can normalize by summing this potential

00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,390
通过将所有潜在值的潜在期间视图相加来归一化
normalize by summing this potential period view over all possible values of

357
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:51,400
通过将所有潜在值的潜在期间视图相加来归一化
period view over all possible values of x1 okay so the rest even under extra

358
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,710
x1好的，所以即使是额外的课，其余的也没有任何区别
period view over all possible values of x1 okay so the rest even under extra

359
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,300
x1好的，所以即使是额外的课，其余的也没有任何区别
x1 okay so the rest even under extra class don't really have any difference

360
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,310
x1好的，所以即使是额外的课，其余的也没有任何区别
class don't really have any difference when it comes to the implementation of

361
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,100
关于我们的标准消除算法的实现，但是
class don't really have any difference when it comes to the implementation of

362
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,920
关于我们的标准消除算法的实现，但是
when it comes to the implementation of our standard elimination algorithm but

363
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:01,930
关于我们的标准消除算法的实现，但是
our standard elimination algorithm but they will help us to do this sort of

364
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,870
他们将帮助我们以图形方式完成这种工作，
our standard elimination algorithm but they will help us to do this sort of

365
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,770
他们将帮助我们以图形方式完成这种工作，
they will help us to do this sort of graphically okay and and it would be

366
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:07,780
他们将帮助我们以图形方式完成这种工作，
graphically okay and and it would be easier way not only to conserve to get

367
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,930
更简便的方法，不仅可以保存正确的概念，还可以
graphically okay and and it would be easier way not only to conserve to get

368
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,010
更简便的方法，不仅可以保存正确的概念，还可以
easier way not only to conserve to get the concept here right but also to

369
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:13,020
更简便的方法，不仅可以保存正确的概念，还可以
the concept here right but also to Graham this and implemented let me see

370
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,790
格雷厄姆（Graham）这样执行，让我看看我在这里还有话要说吗
the concept here right but also to Graham this and implemented let me see

371
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:22,370
格雷厄姆（Graham）这样执行，让我看看我在这里还有话要说吗
Graham this and implemented let me see if I have anything else to say here okay

372
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:22,380
格雷厄姆（Graham）这样执行，让我看看我在这里还有话要说吗
if I have anything else to say here okay so again the only difference is not

373
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,950
因此，唯一的区别不是条件概率，而是潜力
if I have anything else to say here okay so again the only difference is not

374
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,160
因此，唯一的区别不是条件概率，而是潜力
so again the only difference is not conditional probabilities but potentials

375
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,170
因此，唯一的区别不是条件概率，而是潜力
conditional probabilities but potentials defined over maximal cliques and I told

376
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,980
定义了最大的集团，我告诉您您在这里获得了多少点击
conditional probabilities but potentials defined over maximal cliques and I told

377
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,810
定义了最大的集团，我告诉您您在这里获得了多少点击
defined over maximal cliques and I told you how many clicks you have here one

378
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:32,820
定义了最大的集团，我告诉您您在这里获得了多少点击
you how many clicks you have here one two three four and five clicks okay this

379
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,220
两三四和五次点击好，这是无向图，所以好
you how many clicks you have here one two three four and five clicks okay this

380
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,090
两三四和五次点击好，这是无向图，所以好
two three four and five clicks okay this is what undirected graphs it's okay so

381
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:41,100
两三四和五次点击好，这是无向图，所以好
is what undirected graphs it's okay so we need a graphical way that somehow

382
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,920
我们需要一种图形化的方式来以某种方式帮助我们控制复杂性
is what undirected graphs it's okay so we need a graphical way that somehow

383
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,470
我们需要一种图形化的方式来以某种方式帮助我们控制复杂性
we need a graphical way that somehow helps us to control the complexity of

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:45,480
我们需要一种图形化的方式来以某种方式帮助我们控制复杂性
helps us to control the complexity of the eliminate algorithm so we need to

385
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,240
消除算法，所以我们需要看看我们如何做到这一点，我
helps us to control the complexity of the eliminate algorithm so we need to

386
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,870
消除算法，所以我们需要看看我们如何做到这一点，我
the eliminate algorithm so we need to see how we're gonna do this and I'm

387
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
消除算法，所以我们需要看看我们如何做到这一点，我
see how we're gonna do this and I'm going to start with this I deal with a

388
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,990
从这个开始，我将讨论一个不属于控球后卫的问题
see how we're gonna do this and I'm going to start with this I deal with a

389
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,750
从这个开始，我将讨论一个不属于控球后卫的问题
going to start with this I deal with a point guard elimination which is not of

390
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:56,760
从这个开始，我将讨论一个不属于控球后卫的问题
point guard elimination which is not of the graph analog of the elimination

391
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,900
我们已经看到的消除算法的图形类似物，但我要
point guard elimination which is not of the graph analog of the elimination

392
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,450
我们已经看到的消除算法的图形类似物，但我要
the graph analog of the elimination algorithm we have seen but I am gonna

393
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:02,460
我们已经看到的消除算法的图形类似物，但我要
algorithm we have seen but I am gonna post this for undirected graphs for a

394
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,820
将其发布给无向图是有原因的，然后我将概括一下
algorithm we have seen but I am gonna post this for undirected graphs for a

395
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,100
将其发布给无向图是有原因的，然后我将概括一下
post this for undirected graphs for a reason and then I will generalize the

396
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,110
将其发布给无向图是有原因的，然后我将概括一下
reason and then I will generalize the directed graphs

397
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,120
有向图好吧，让我们看看这是否是一部分
reason and then I will generalize the directed graphs

398
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,020
有向图好吧，让我们看看这是否是一部分
directed graphs okay so let's see if this is part

399
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,300
理论上的，所以我们有图G的消除或驱使
directed graphs okay so let's see if this is part

400
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,310
理论上的，所以我们有图G的消除或驱使


401
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:19,610
理论上的，所以我们有图G的消除或驱使
theoretical so we have an elimination or drive for graph G and the elimination

402
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:19,620
理论上的，所以我们有图G的消除或驱使
drive for graph G and the elimination the gutter elimination algorithm white

403
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,050
排水沟消除算法白色统治
drive for graph G and the elimination the gutter elimination algorithm white

404
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,700
排水沟消除算法白色统治
the gutter elimination algorithm white domination does the trick

405
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:25,710
排水沟消除算法白色统治
domination does the trick it says probably no reasoning

406
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,650
它说可能没有推理消除规则可以连接所有
domination does the trick it says probably no reasoning

407
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,410
它说可能没有推理消除规则可以连接所有
it says probably no reasoning elimination rule is connect all if it's

408
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:30,420
它说可能没有推理消除规则可以连接所有
elimination rule is connect all if it's very boots and then let me move excite

409
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,900
非常长的靴子，然后让我从图中移开兴奋点，然后将它放成蓝色
elimination rule is connect all if it's very boots and then let me move excite

410
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:41,360
非常长的靴子，然后让我从图中移开兴奋点，然后将它放成蓝色
very boots and then let me move excite from the graph and I put this in blue

411
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:41,370
非常长的靴子，然后让我从图中移开兴奋点，然后将它放成蓝色
from the graph and I put this in blue for the purpose connect all the

412
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,190
为此，将XI的所有邻居和XI的邻居
from the graph and I put this in blue for the purpose connect all the

413
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,410
为此，将XI的所有邻居和XI的邻居
for the purpose connect all the neighbors of X I and the neighbors of

414
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:45,420
为此，将XI的所有邻居和XI的邻居
neighbors of X I and the neighbors of the graph is the DEF neighbors so that's

415
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,280
该图是DEF邻居，所以这是一个赠款概念，与您拥有的不一样
neighbors of X I and the neighbors of the graph is the DEF neighbors so that's

416
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,530
该图是DEF邻居，所以这是一个赠款概念，与您拥有的不一样
the graph is the DEF neighbors so that's a grant concept it's not like you have

417
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:51,540
该图是DEF邻居，所以这是一个赠款概念，与您拥有的不一样
a grant concept it's not like you have ever seen you say the patterns from the

418
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,300
没看过你说过孩子们的模式，你只知道图形损坏
a grant concept it's not like you have ever seen you say the patterns from the

419
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,400
没看过你说过孩子们的模式，你只知道图形损坏
ever seen you say the patterns from the kids and you know just the graph damage

420
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:55,410
没看过你说过孩子们的模式，你只知道图形损坏
kids and you know just the graph damage okay

421
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,060
好吧，所以您连接了所有邻居，
kids and you know just the graph damage okay

422
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,950
好吧，所以您连接了所有邻居，
okay so you connect all the neighbors and

423
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:57,960
好吧，所以您连接了所有邻居，
so you connect all the neighbors and then we move excite from the graph so

424
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,860
然后我们从图表中移动兴奋，让我们来看看这件事是如何工作的
so you connect all the neighbors and then we move excite from the graph so

425
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,260
然后我们从图表中移动兴奋，让我们来看看这件事是如何工作的
then we move excite from the graph so let's take how this thing works

426
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:02,270
然后我们从图表中移动兴奋，让我们来看看这件事是如何工作的
let's take how this thing works graphically so let's say we want this is

427
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,380
以图形方式表示，假设我们希望这是我们想要的消除顺序
let's take how this thing works graphically so let's say we want this is

428
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,970
以图形方式表示，假设我们希望这是我们想要的消除顺序
graphically so let's say we want this is the elimination order we want to

429
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:07,980
以图形方式表示，假设我们希望这是我们想要的消除顺序
the elimination order we want to eliminate first let's fix then X 5 X 4 X

430
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,610
首先消除，让我们修复，然后再消除X 5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1，以便消除X 6
the elimination order we want to eliminate first let's fix then X 5 X 4 X

431
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,830
首先消除，让我们修复，然后再消除X 5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1，以便消除X 6
eliminate first let's fix then X 5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1 so to eliminate X 6

432
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:15,840
首先消除，让我们修复，然后再消除X 5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1，以便消除X 6
3 X 2 X 1 so to eliminate X 6 what do we need to do

433
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,260
我们需要做些什么消除算法，看一下
3 X 2 X 1 so to eliminate X 6 what do we need to do

434
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,010
我们需要做些什么消除算法，看一下
what do we need to do elimination algorithm look at the

435
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,020
我们需要做些什么消除算法，看一下
elimination algorithm look at the neighbors the neighbors have two and

436
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,300
邻居邻居的水里有两个和五个
elimination algorithm look at the neighbors the neighbors have two and

437
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,030
邻居邻居的水里有两个和五个
neighbors the neighbors have two and five in the water the neighborhood's

438
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,040
邻居邻居的水里有两个和五个
five in the water the neighborhood's collective then we eliminated six we get

439
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,840
然后我们消除了六个，我们在下一个节点的地球中得到了这个
five in the water the neighborhood's collective then we eliminated six we get

440
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,380
然后我们消除了六个，我们在下一个节点的地球中得到了这个
collective then we eliminated six we get this then in our earth of the next node

441
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:32,390
然后我们消除了六个，我们在下一个节点的地球中得到了这个
this then in our earth of the next node is expired before we eliminate expired

442
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,530
在我们消除过期之前已过期，请查看名称与X 2和X的关系
this then in our earth of the next node is expired before we eliminate expired

443
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,360
在我们消除过期之前已过期，请查看名称与X 2和X的关系
is expired before we eliminate expired would look at the name versus X 2 and X

444
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,370
在我们消除过期之前已过期，请查看名称与X 2和X的关系
would look at the name versus X 2 and X 3 we connect them and then with what we

445
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,180
3我们将它们连接起来，然后对X 5进行操作，然后消除下一个节点
would look at the name versus X 2 and X 3 we connect them and then with what we

446
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,930
3我们将它们连接起来，然后对X 5进行操作，然后消除下一个节点
3 we connect them and then with what we do to X 5 eliminate then our next node

447
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:43,940
3我们将它们连接起来，然后对X 5进行操作，然后消除下一个节点
do to X 5 eliminate then our next node is explore the neighbor is X 2 there is

448
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,390
正在探索的邻居是X 2，没有必要建立链接，所以我们
do to X 5 eliminate then our next node is explore the neighbor is X 2 there is

449
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,610
正在探索的邻居是X 2，没有必要建立链接，所以我们
is explore the neighbor is X 2 there is nothing no need to put a link so we

450
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:48,620
正在探索的邻居是X 2，没有必要建立链接，所以我们
nothing no need to put a link so we eliminate X 4 which is list then the

451
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,710
消除列表中的X 4，然后像这样下一个固定的X 3，然后消除X 1
nothing no need to put a link so we eliminate X 4 which is list then the

452
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,420
消除列表中的X 4，然后像这样下一个固定的X 3，然后消除X 1
eliminate X 4 which is list then the next fixed X 3 like this and then X 1

453
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:54,430
消除列表中的X 4，然后像这样下一个固定的X 3，然后消除X 1
next fixed X 3 like this and then X 1 the key thing here is the following step

454
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:59,140
关键是接下来的步骤，我们以某种方式与
next fixed X 3 like this and then X 1 the key thing here is the following step

455
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,970
关键是接下来的步骤，我们以某种方式与
the key thing here is the following step that somehow we connect with the

456
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:00,980
关键是接下来的步骤，我们以某种方式与
that somehow we connect with the neighbors all right and who else did we

457
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,180
邻居很好，我们还和谁联系了，所以这是
that somehow we connect with the neighbors all right and who else did we

458
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,480
邻居很好，我们还和谁联系了，所以这是
neighbors all right and who else did we connect the neighbors so this was

459
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,490
邻居很好，我们还和谁联系了，所以这是
connect the neighbors so this was eliminated and then this thing here but

460
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:11,140
消除，然后在这里将其连接但将节点2和3连接起来
connect the neighbors so this was eliminated and then this thing here but

461
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,500
消除，然后在这里将其连接但将节点2和3连接起来
eliminated and then this thing here but connected nodes 2 &amp; 3

462
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:13,510
消除，然后在这里将其连接但将节点2和3连接起来
connected nodes 2 &amp; 3 okay and again the concept of the

463
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,840
好吧，邻国权利的概念是一个很好的政治
connected nodes 2 &amp; 3 okay and again the concept of the

464
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,920
好吧，邻国权利的概念是一个很好的政治
okay and again the concept of the neighbors right is is a good political

465
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:20,930
好吧，邻国权利的概念是一个很好的政治
neighbors right is is a good political concept in the context of undirected

466
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,190
在无向图的上下文中的概念现在您会注意到，每次
neighbors right is is a good political concept in the context of undirected

467
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,470
在无向图的上下文中的概念现在您会注意到，每次
concept in the context of undirected graphs now you notice that each time a

468
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
在无向图的上下文中的概念现在您会注意到，每次
graphs now you notice that each time a node is eliminated all of its neighbors

469
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,810
节点被消除，其所有邻居均正确连接，形成一个
graphs now you notice that each time a node is eliminated all of its neighbors

470
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,270
节点被消除，其所有邻居均正确连接，形成一个
node is eliminated all of its neighbors are correct are connected forming a

471
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:31,280
节点被消除，其所有邻居均正确连接，形成一个
are correct are connected forming a clique that's what we call the

472
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,490
派系，这就是我们所说的消除小河，例如这里
are correct are connected forming a clique that's what we call the

473
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,030
派系，这就是我们所说的消除小河，例如这里
clique that's what we call the elimination Creek so for example here

474
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
派系，这就是我们所说的消除小河，例如这里
elimination Creek so for example here when I connect now student 5 2 5 &amp; 6 is

475
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,630
当我现在连接时，学生5 2 5＆6是一个集团完全连接的节点集
elimination Creek so for example here when I connect now student 5 2 5 &amp; 6 is

476
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,380
当我现在连接时，学生5 2 5＆6是一个集团完全连接的节点集
when I connect now student 5 2 5 &amp; 6 is a clique fully connected set of nodes

477
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,390
当我现在连接时，学生5 2 5＆6是一个集团完全连接的节点集
a clique fully connected set of nodes ok when I go in and connect to a 3 2 or

478

522
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:15,930
消除基本上要与之相乘的音符，我将使用
multiply basically I'm gonna work with the potentials from districts so the

523
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,590
来自各地区的潜力，因此点击的规模越大，越多
multiply basically I'm gonna work with the potentials from districts so the

524
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,210
来自各地区的潜力，因此点击的规模越大，越多
the potentials from districts so the biggest the size of the click the more

525
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:20,220
来自各地区的潜力，因此点击的规模越大，越多
biggest the size of the click the more complex the algorithm will be and that's

526
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,460
算法将会很复杂，这就是为什么最大的集团，但是您
biggest the size of the click the more complex the algorithm will be and that's

527
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,400
算法将会很复杂，这就是为什么最大的集团，但是您
complex the algorithm will be and that's why the largest clique but that you

528
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:25,410
算法将会很复杂，这就是为什么最大的集团，但是您
why the largest clique but that you can't with defines the order of complex

529
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,640
无法定义算法的复杂字段的顺序
why the largest clique but that you can't with defines the order of complex

无法定义算法的复杂字段的顺序
fields the of the algorithm okay so nowadays basically the maximum

532
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,780
好吧，所以现在基本上希腊人的最大人数是3，所以
fields the of the algorithm okay so nowadays basically the maximum

533
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,210
好吧，所以现在基本上希腊人的最大人数是3，所以
okay so nowadays basically the maximum size of the Greeks is 3 so that will

534
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:35,220
好吧，所以现在基本上希腊人的最大人数是3，所以
size of the Greeks is 3 so that will define the complexity of the output so

535
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,000
定义输出的复杂度，所以让我们说它是否不包含K值
size of the Greeks is 3 so that will define the complexity of the output so

536
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,160
定义输出的复杂度，所以让我们说它是否不包含K值
define the complexity of the output so let's say if it's not takes K values

537
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,170
定义输出的复杂度，所以让我们说它是否不包含K值
let's say if it's not takes K values this could be gave the power 3 so case

538
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,330
这可以赋予3的幂，所以在前面的讲座中我们看到的是
let's say if it's not takes K values this could be gave the power 3 so case

539
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,460
这可以赋予3的幂，所以在前面的讲座中我们看到的是
this could be gave the power 3 so case what we saw in the earlier lecture is

540
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:46,470
这可以赋予3的幂，所以在前面的讲座中我们看到的是
what we saw in the earlier lecture is defined as the 3 width of the graph okay

541
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,320
定义为图的3个宽度
what we saw in the earlier lecture is defined as the 3 width of the graph okay

542
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,510
定义为图的3个宽度
defined as the 3 width of the graph okay okay so this is dependence masking even

543
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,520
定义为图的3个宽度
okay so this is dependence masking even a maximum size the size of the maximum

544
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,370
最大大小实现时获得的最大派系的大小
okay so this is dependence masking even a maximum size the size of the maximum

545
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,770
最大大小实现时获得的最大派系的大小
a maximum size the size of the maximum clique that you get when you implement

最大大小实现时获得的最大派系的大小
clique that you get when you implement this graph lumination output okay

547
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:06,050
这个图的发光输出还可以
clique that you get when you implement this graph lumination output okay

548
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:12,250

all right so so the I'm looking here on the front bullet right so it says the

551
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:21,140
好的，所以我在前面的子弹上看这里，它说
the front bullet right so it says the elimination of the node has the effect

graph elimination algorithm there is an intermediate step and in previous step

599
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:01,880
图消除算法有一个中间步骤，在上一步中
intermediate step and in previous step that's extremely important it says where

600
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,970
这是非常重要的，它说医生在哪里，然后将其转化为
intermediate step and in previous step that's extremely important it says where

601
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,789
这是非常重要的，它说医生在哪里，然后将其转化为
that's extremely important it says where is the doctor and then transform it to

602
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:06,799
这是非常重要的，它说医生在哪里，然后将其转化为
is the doctor and then transform it to an undirected graph about sort of a very

603
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,510
如果您错过了该步骤，则这将是一个关于非常棘手的概念的无向图
is the doctor and then transform it to an undirected graph about sort of a very

604
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,250
如果您错过了该步骤，则这将是一个关于非常棘手的概念的无向图
an undirected graph about sort of a very tricky concept if you miss the step

605
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:13,260
如果您错过了该步骤，则这将是一个关于非常棘手的概念的无向图
tricky concept if you miss the step basically this Albert do not work so the

606
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,820
基本上这个阿尔伯特不起作用，所以这里的想法不是简单地改变它
tricky concept if you miss the step basically this Albert do not work so the

607
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,669
基本上这个阿尔伯特不起作用，所以这里的想法不是简单地改变它
basically this Albert do not work so the idea here is not simply to transform it

608
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
基本上这个阿尔伯特不起作用，所以这里的想法不是简单地改变它
idea here is not simply to transform it an undirected graph but you have to

609
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,169
无向图，但您必须保湿并提醒我
idea here is not simply to transform it an undirected graph but you have to

610
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:22,970
无向图，但您必须保湿并提醒我
an undirected graph but you have to moisturize it and remind me which

611
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:22,980
无向图，但您必须保湿并提醒我
moisturize it and remind me which modernization here let's make the

612
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,740
在这里进行现代化改造，让父母基本可以，所以这里的想法
moisturize it and remind me which modernization here let's make the

613
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,169
在这里进行现代化改造，让父母基本可以，所以这里的想法
modernization here let's make the parents basically okay so the idea here

614
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:30,179
在这里进行现代化改造，让父母基本可以，所以这里的想法
parents basically okay so the idea here is for example we need to connect the

615
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:32,720
例如，我们需要连接父母，比如说6和2＆5
parents basically okay so the idea here is for example we need to connect the

616
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,590
例如，我们需要连接父母，比如说6和2＆5
is for example we need to connect the parents let's say of 6 which is 2 &amp; 5

617
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:35,600
例如，我们需要连接父母，比如说6和2＆5
parents let's say of 6 which is 2 &amp; 5 and then transform this to an undirected

618
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,730
然后将其转换为无向图，你知道下一个奎师那是
parents let's say of 6 which is 2 &amp; 5 and then transform this to an undirected

619
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,360
然后将其转换为无向图，你知道下一个奎师那是
and then transform this to an undirected graph can you know the next krishna is

620
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:44,370
然后将其转换为无向图，你知道下一个奎师那是
graph can you know the next krishna is basically the so pictorially why if you

621
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,090
基本上是这样，从图形上讲，如果不执行此步骤，为什么会一团糟
graph can you know the next krishna is basically the so pictorially why if you

622
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,250
基本上是这样，从图形上讲，如果不执行此步骤，为什么会一团糟
basically the so pictorially why if you don't do this step you would be messing

623
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:49,260
基本上是这样，从图形上讲，如果不执行此步骤，为什么会一团糟
don't do this step you would be messing things up but can anybody basically just

624
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,870
问题，但是任何人基本上都可以停止思考为什么要注意这一点吗？
don't do this step you would be messing things up but can anybody basically just

625
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:57,919
问题，但是任何人基本上都可以停止思考为什么要注意这一点吗？
things up but can anybody basically just stop thinking why that step is attention

626
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:07,740
不，但是我们记得在无向图中的，我们还连接了
things up but can anybody basically just stop thinking why that step is attention

627
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:07,750
不，但是我们记得在无向图中的，我们还连接了


628
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:14,190
不，但是我们记得在无向图中的，我们还连接了
no but we remembered in the in the in the undirected graph we also connect the

629
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,200
不，但是我们记得在无向图中的，我们还连接了
the undirected graph we also connect the neighbors right so somebody will say

630
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,090
邻居说得对，所以有人会说我限制X 6 2和5为
the undirected graph we also connect the neighbors right so somebody will say

631
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:21,930
邻居说得对，所以有人会说我限制X 6 2和5为
neighbors right so somebody will say when let's say I limit X 6 2 &amp; 5 will be

632
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:21,940
邻居说得对，所以有人会说我限制X 6 2和5为
when let's say I limit X 6 2 &amp; 5 will be neighbors I'm going to connect them so

633
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,340
邻居，我要联系他们，所以有了现代化，所以我采取了
when let's say I limit X 6 2 &amp; 5 will be neighbors I'm going to connect them so

634
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,740
邻居，我要联系他们，所以有了现代化，所以我采取了
neighbors I'm going to connect them so there is the modernization so I took

635
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:25,750
邻居，我要联系他们，所以有了现代化，所以我采取了
there is the modernization so I took care of it

636
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,020
关心它，为什么我需要道德化
there is the modernization so I took care of it

637
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,289
关心它，为什么我需要道德化
care of it so why do I need to moralize

638
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:41,910
我们说的是好像在第一个循环中，但是因为在这里我们收集了
care of it so why do I need to moralize

639
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:41,920
我们说的是好像在第一个循环中，但是因为在这里我们收集了


640
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:48,630
我们说的是好像在第一个循环中，但是因为在这里我们收集了
we're saying is it seems like in first loop but because here we collect the

641
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,640
我们说的是好像在第一个循环中，但是因为在这里我们收集了
loop but because here we collect the neighbors that maybe this does already

642
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,970
邻居，也许这确实已经妖魔化了
loop but because here we collect the neighbors that maybe this does already

643
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,990
邻居，也许这确实已经妖魔化了
neighbors that maybe this does already demonisation does it

644
00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:04,910
我的意思是让我们不要只是想像不到网络而已
neighbors that maybe this does already demonisation does it

645
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:04,920
我的意思是让我们不要只是想像不到网络而已


646
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:11,150
我的意思是让我们不要只是想像不到网络而已
I mean let's not go through that it to the net right that's not just imagining

647
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:11,160
我的意思是让我们不要只是想像不到网络而已
the net right that's not just imagining things so then we can bypass many of

648
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,090
因此我们可以绕过以下幻灯片中的许多内容，所以让我们
the net right that's not just imagining things so then we can bypass many of

649
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,130
因此我们可以绕过以下幻灯片中的许多内容，所以让我们
things so then we can bypass many of them of the following slides so let's

650
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:16,140
因此我们可以绕过以下幻灯片中的许多内容，所以让我们
them of the following slides so let's say we make this an undirected graph

651
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,100
说我们使它成为一个无向图好吧，所以我们连接了Rene，但我
them of the following slides so let's say we make this an undirected graph

652
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,580
说我们使它成为一个无向图好吧，所以我们连接了Rene，但我
say we make this an undirected graph alright okay so we connect Rene but I'm

653
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:25,590
说我们使它成为一个无向图好吧，所以我们连接了Rene，但我
alright okay so we connect Rene but I'm sorry this is okay so in this case this

654
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,280
抱歉，这还可以，所以在这种情况下，这是我的台词。
alright okay so we connect Rene but I'm sorry this is okay so in this case this

655
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,540
抱歉，这还可以，所以在这种情况下，这是我的台词。
sorry this is okay so in this case this is this distant my lines okay I this

656
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:32,550
抱歉，这还可以，所以在这种情况下，这是我的台词。
is this distant my lines okay I this will not work my god okay so let's see

657
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,210
我的天哪行不通，所以让我们看一下这个例子，如果有分钟x6
is this distant my lines okay I this will not work my god okay so let's see

658
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,160
我的天哪行不通，所以让我们看一下这个例子，如果有分钟x6
will not work my god okay so let's see here's the example if any minute x6

659
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,170
我的天哪行不通，所以让我们看一下这个例子，如果有分钟x6
here's the example if any minute x6 the way we did it before there's not

660
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,650
在没有任何问题之前我们做的方式，所以让我去做
here's the example if any minute x6 the way we did it before there's not

661
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:46,730
在没有任何问题之前我们做的方式，所以让我去做
the way we did it before there's not gonna be any issue right so let me do

662
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:46,740
在没有任何问题之前我们做的方式，所以让我去做
gonna be any issue right so let me do the following let me try one in

663
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,800
以下让我尝试终止x6，因为不会有
gonna be any issue right so let me do the following let me try one in

664
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,160
以下让我尝试终止x6，因为不会有
the following let me try one in terminating x6 because there will not be

665
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,170
以下让我尝试终止x6，因为不会有
terminating x6 because there will not be able to how we're different some

666
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,740
能够使我们与众不同一些组织确实说我们消除了
terminating x6 because there will not be able to how we're different some

667
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,050
能够使我们与众不同一些组织确实说我们消除了
able to how we're different some organization does let's say we eliminate

668
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,060
能够使我们与众不同一些组织确实说我们消除了
organization does let's say we eliminate X Pfeiffer was it you go back to this

669
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,260
X Pfeiffer是您回到这张幻灯片并消除X 5并说我们
organization does let's say we eliminate X Pfeiffer was it you go back to this

670
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,370
X Pfeiffer是您回到这张幻灯片并消除X 5并说我们
X Pfeiffer was it you go back to this slide and eliminate X 5 and let's say we

671
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:04,380
X Pfeiffer是您回到这张幻灯片并消除X 5并说我们
slide and eliminate X 5 and let's say we don't do any monetization so if you

672
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:10,070
不要做任何货币化，所以如果你不否认实现而转移
slide and eliminate X 5 and let's say we don't do any monetization so if you

673
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,750
不要做任何货币化，所以如果你不否认实现而转移
don't do any monetization so if you don't deny realization and you transfer

674
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760
不要做任何货币化，所以如果你不否认实现而转移
don't deny realization and you transfer this to you know to an undirected graph

675
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,030
据您所知，对于无向图，您要做的第一件事是什么
don't deny realization and you transfer this to you know to an undirected graph

676
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,650
据您所知，对于无向图，您要做的第一件事是什么
this to you know to an undirected graph what is the first thing you're going to

677
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:18,660
据您所知，对于无向图，您要做的第一件事是什么
what is the first thing you're going to do on this guy so there's no

678
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,730
对这个人做，所以这里没有现代化，所以如果我
what is the first thing you're going to do on this guy so there's no

679
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,830
对这个人做，所以这里没有现代化，所以如果我
do on this guy so there's no modernization here right so if I

680
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:24,840
对这个人做，所以这里没有现代化，所以如果我
modernization here right so if I eliminate X 5 what needs to happen in

681
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,210
消除X 5无向图算法中需要发生的事情
modernization here right so if I eliminate X 5 what needs to happen in

682
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,780
消除X 5无向图算法中需要发生的事情
eliminate X 5 what needs to happen in the undirected graph algorithm

00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,750
邻居是否还活着
eliminate X 5 what needs to happen in the undirected graph algorithm

684
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:36,760
邻居是否还活着


685
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,320
邻居是否还活着
whether the neighbor survived

686
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,320
所以让我向您展示计算权，这是无向图，所以如果
whether the neighbor survived

687
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,330
所以让我向您展示计算权，这是无向图，所以如果


688
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:52,110
所以让我向您展示计算权，这是无向图，所以如果
so we let me show you the calculation right this is the undirected graph so if

689
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:52,120
所以让我向您展示计算权，这是无向图，所以如果
right this is the undirected graph so if I'm going to eliminate X 5 what we need

690
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,810
我要消除X 5，我们需要做的是求和X 5
right this is the undirected graph so if I'm going to eliminate X 5 what we need

691
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,150
我要消除X 5，我们需要做的是求和X 5
I'm going to eliminate X 5 what we need to do is we need to sum or X 5 the

692
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:57,160
我要消除X 5，我们需要做的是求和X 5
to do is we need to sum or X 5 the following conditional distributions

693
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,520
给定X 3正确和X 6，以下条件分布已过期
to do is we need to sum or X 5 the following conditional distributions

给定X 3正确和X 6，以下条件分布已过期
expired given X 3 all right and X 6 given X 2 X 5 we read this from the

696
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,560
给定X 2 X 5，我们从有向图上读取它，所以基本上是一种方法或
expired given X 3 all right and X 6 given X 2 X 5 we read this from the

697
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,020
给定X 2 X 5，我们从有向图上读取它，所以基本上是一种方法或
given X 2 X 5 we read this from the directed graph so basically one way or

698
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,030
给定X 2 X 5，我们从有向图上读取它，所以基本上是一种方法或
directed graph so basically one way or another this is the calculation that we

699
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,450
另一个是我们需要做的计算，当您查看此内容时
directed graph so basically one way or another this is the calculation that we

700
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,850
另一个是我们需要做的计算，当您查看此内容时
another this is the calculation that we need to do and when you look at this

701
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:14,860
另一个是我们需要做的计算，当您查看此内容时
need to do and when you look at this calculation with X 5 integrated out who

702
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,690
使用X 5进行集成计算，现在谁获得了哪个节点之间的依赖关系
need to do and when you look at this calculation with X 5 integrated out who

703
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,440
使用X 5进行集成计算，现在谁获得了哪个节点之间的依赖关系
calculation with X 5 integrated out who now get dependencies between which node

704
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:21,450
使用X 5进行集成计算，现在谁获得了哪个节点之间的依赖关系
now get dependencies between which node X 2 X 3 and X 6 so let me see this X 2 X

705
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:27,210
X 2 X 3和X 6，所以让我看看X 2 X 3和XX 6是依赖关系
now get dependencies between which node X 2 X 3 and X 6 so let me see this X 2 X

706
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:32,520
X 2 X 3和X 6，所以让我看看X 2 X 3和XX 6是依赖关系
X 2 X 3 and X 6 so let me see this X 2 X 3 and X X 6 is that dependency going to

707
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:32,530
X 2 X 3和X 6，所以让我看看X 2 X 3和XX 6是依赖关系
3 and X X 6 is that dependency going to be there when we use just the undirected

708
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,040
当我们只使用无向图消除算法而没有
3 and X X 6 is that dependency going to be there when we use just the undirected

00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,830
当我们只使用无向图消除算法而没有
be there when we use just the undirected graph elimination algorithm without

710
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:37,840
当我们只使用无向图消除算法而没有
graph elimination algorithm without realization so again we have a

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,500
再次意识到X 2 X 3和X 6 X 2 X之间存在依赖关系
graph elimination algorithm without realization so again we have a

811
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:14,440
好吧，接下来的事情是，现在人们真的已经看到了，所以我
algorithm the other one comes from the undirected graph three minutes

812
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:14,450
好吧，接下来的事情是，现在人们真的已经看到了，所以我


813
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:21,520
好吧，接下来的事情是，现在人们真的已经看到了，所以我
all right the next thing is really now people really have seen it okay so I'm

814
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:21,530
好吧，接下来的事情是，现在人们真的已经看到了，所以我
people really have seen it okay so I'm going to stop there and then I'm going

815
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,680
要停在那里，然后我要换课，然后我要去
people really have seen it okay so I'm going to stop there and then I'm going

816
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:30,480
要停在那里，然后我要换课，然后我要去
going to stop there and then I'm going to switch lecture and I'm going to go to

817
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:30,490
要停在那里，然后我要换课，然后我要去
to switch lecture and I'm going to go to punish my computer do you see a mouse on

818
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,810
惩罚我的电脑，您是否在屏幕上看到鼠标
to switch lecture and I'm going to go to punish my computer do you see a mouse on

punish my computer do you see a mouse on the screen

821
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:42,760
所以我应该怎么做好，让我先把这东西拿出来


822
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,659
所以我应该怎么做好，让我先把这东西拿出来
so what do I supposed to do okay let me remove this thing out first

823
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:47,669
所以我应该怎么做好，让我先把这东西拿出来
remove this thing out first now people lost uh some of the computer

824
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:50,070
现在人们失去了一些计算机屏幕
remove this thing out first now people lost uh some of the computer

825
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,410
现在人们失去了一些计算机屏幕
now people lost uh some of the computer screen

826
00:29:52,410 --> 00:30:13,250
好的，所以我们基本上要看如何
now people lost uh some of the computer screen

827
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:13,260
好的，所以我们基本上要看如何


828
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:19,980
好的，所以我们基本上要看如何
all right okay so we're going to basically see how

829
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:19,990
好的，所以我们基本上要看如何
okay so we're going to basically see how slowly this positive factorization that

830
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,850
慢慢地，这种在无神的神中分布的积极因式分解
okay so we're going to basically see how slowly this positive factorization that

832
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:25,809
慢慢地，这种在无神的神中分布的积极因式分解
distributions in undirected God okay and actually I'm going to come back

833
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:28,169
好的，实际上我将更严格地回到这个主题
distributions in undirected God okay and actually I'm going to come back

834

877
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:57,370
这样的事情更多是在您具有因果关系时
you have causality relation okay we mentioned one example that would like to

878
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:01,799
提到了一个想回到现在的例子，基本上
you have causality relation okay we mentioned one example that would like to

879
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:07,970
提到了一个想回到现在的例子，基本上
mentioned one example that would like to come back now to it okay so basically

880
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:07,980
提到了一个想回到现在的例子，基本上
come back now to it okay so basically you know our model so we have nodes

881
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:11,070
您知道我们的模型，所以我们的节点与以前完全一样，但是随机
come back now to it okay so basically you know our model so we have nodes

882
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,289
您知道我们的模型，所以我们的节点与以前完全一样，但是随机
you know our model so we have nodes exactly as before but there are random

883
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:13,299
您知道我们的模型，所以我们的节点与以前完全一样，但是随机
exactly as before but there are random variables we have entities that describe

884
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:16,470
我们拥有描述基本独立关系的实体的变量，以及
exactly as before but there are random variables we have entities that describe

885
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:20,399
我们拥有描述基本独立关系的实体的变量，以及
variables we have entities that describe basically independent relations and

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:20,409
我们拥有描述基本独立关系的实体的变量，以及
basically independent relations and there is no

887
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:21,130

basically independent relations and there is no

888
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:24,010
没有对称性，但与方向性有关
there is no symmetry but has to do with directional

889
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:24,020
没有对称性，但与方向性有关
symmetry but has to do with directional arrows so there's a sense of think that

890
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,560
箭头，所以有一种感觉，你知道我是你的父母
symmetry but has to do with directional arrows so there's a sense of think that

891
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,680
箭头，所以有一种感觉，你知道我是你的父母
arrows so there's a sense of think that you know I'm your parent here everyone

892
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:29,690
箭头，所以有一种感觉，你知道我是你的父母
you know I'm your parent here everyone is the parent you know so the summation

893
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,660
是您知道的父代，所以a和C之间的总和就可以了
you know I'm your parent here everyone is the parent you know so the summation

894
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,450
是您知道的父代，所以a和C之间的总和就可以了
is the parent you know so the summation between a and C is equivalent okay there

895
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:34,460
是您知道的父代，所以a和C之间的总和就可以了
between a and C is equivalent okay there is no directionality here and it comes

896
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,770
在这里没有方向性，但它却出现了，但独立性意识到了这一点
between a and C is equivalent okay there is no directionality here and it comes

897
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,650
在这里没有方向性，但它却出现了，但独立性意识到了这一点
is no directionality here and it comes up but the independence realizes this

898
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:41,660
在这里没有方向性，但它却出现了，但独立性意识到了这一点
up but the independence realizes this very important one of the electric

899
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,510
非常重要的电动阀之一
up but the independence realizes this very important one of the electric

900
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,080
非常重要的电动阀之一
very important one of the electric valves

901
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,090
非常重要的电动阀之一
valves they're basically got separation you

902
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:49,060
他们基本上是分开的，你知道想法，所以这是我的一个关系
valves they're basically got separation you

903
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:54,490
他们基本上是分开的，你知道想法，所以这是我的一个关系
they're basically got separation you know ideas so here is a one relation I

904
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:54,500
他们基本上是分开的，你知道想法，所以这是我的一个关系
know ideas so here is a one relation I said that a and B are independent given

905
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,650
说a和B是独立的，给定两个T和D好的，那么发生的是
know ideas so here is a one relation I said that a and B are independent given

906
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,370
说a和B是独立的，给定两个T和D好的，那么发生的是
said that a and B are independent given two T and D okay so what happens is to

907
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:00,380
说a和B是独立的，给定两个T和D好的，那么发生的是
two T and D okay so what happens is to the conditioned on C and D and I claim

908
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,640
以C和D为条件，我声称a独立于B，因为每个
two T and D okay so what happens is to the conditioned on C and D and I claim

909
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,940
以C和D为条件，我声称a独立于B，因为每个
the conditioned on C and D and I claim that a is independent of B because every

910
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:06,950
以C和D为条件，我声称a独立于B，因为每个
that a is independent of B because every party from A to B has to pass through C

911
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,550
从A到B的一方必须经过C和D，所以如果我给C和D，则路径为
that a is independent of B because every party from A to B has to pass through C

912
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,670
从A到B的一方必须经过C和D，所以如果我给C和D，则路径为
party from A to B has to pass through C and D so if I given C and D the path is

913
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:12,680
从A到B的一方必须经过C和D，所以如果我给C和D，则路径为
and D so if I given C and D the path is blocked in a completely graph theoretic

914
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,490
被完全图论的理论浪费所阻塞，换句话说，没有路径
and D so if I given C and D the path is blocked in a completely graph theoretic

915
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,110
被完全图论的理论浪费所阻塞，换句话说，没有路径
blocked in a completely graph theoretic waste in other words there is no path

916
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,120
被完全图论的理论浪费所阻塞，换句话说，没有路径
waste in other words there is no path from A to B that doesn't pass through

917
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,150
从A到B不会通过C和D的并集
waste in other words there is no path from A to B that doesn't pass through

918
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:23,590
从A到B不会通过C和D的并集
from A to B that doesn't pass through see the union of C and D okay it's a

919
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:23,600
从A到B不会通过C和D的并集
see the union of C and D okay it's a critical Hritik graph theoretic

920
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,660
关键的Hritik图理论算法，所以我们确实有这个
see the union of C and D okay it's a critical Hritik graph theoretic

921
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,530
关键的Hritik图理论算法，所以我们确实有这个
critical Hritik graph theoretic algorithm right so we do have this

922
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:28,540
关键的Hritik图理论算法，所以我们确实有这个
algorithm right so we do have this explain a wasting we had with the torque

923
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,910
解释我们在定向中显示的扭矩独立性所造成的浪费
algorithm right so we do have this explain a wasting we had with the torque

924
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,160
解释我们在定向中显示的扭矩独立性所造成的浪费
explain a wasting we had with the torque independence that we show in directed

925
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,170

无向图的原因，因为在这里mmm的底部也是我对2的要求。
of undirected graphs because here mmm the bottom also my claim is 2 to the

957
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:44,769
无向图的原因，因为在这里mmm的底部也是我对2的要求。
the bottom also my claim is 2 to the power n n minus 1 over 2 the distance

958
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:47,609
如果我必须知道，我的意思是距离nn减去2的1倍
the bottom also my claim is 2 to the power n n minus 1 over 2 the distance

959
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:51,509

960
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:51,519
如果我必须知道，我的意思是距离nn减去2的1倍
for what I mean if I have to knowledge there's no self connect to go they are

961
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:53,399
没有自我联系去，他们没有联系
for what I mean if I have to knowledge there's no self connect to go they are

there's no self connect to go they are not connected

963
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:54,429
没有自我联系去，他们没有联系
not connected that's what are the two cups ok so the

964
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,789
那是两个杯子好吗，所以您可以获得的图形总数
not connected that's what are the two cups ok so the

00:34:56,789 --> 00:34:59,490
那是两个杯子好吗，所以您可以获得的图形总数
that's what are the two cups ok so the total number of graphs that you can get

966
00:34:59,490 --> 00:34:59,500
那是两个杯子好吗，所以您可以获得的图形总数
total number of graphs that you can get undirected graphs or the set of them

from the variables is 2 to the power M times n minus 1 over 2m is because you

970
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,700
n减去1超过2m是因为您有印象笔记
from the variables is 2 to the power M times n minus 1 over 2m is because you

971
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,420
n减去1超过2m是因为您有印象笔记
times n minus 1 over 2m is because you have evernotes

972
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:09,430
n减去1超过2m是因为您有印象笔记
have evernotes and every node can be connected with the

973
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,309

00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,089
需要记住您所知道的规则，我们必须共同分享这些知识
extremely simple there is no you don't need to remember the rules

995
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:50,430
需要记住您所知道的规则，我们必须共同分享这些知识
need to remember the rules you know we have to share them heads and

996
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:50,440
需要记住您所知道的规则，我们必须共同分享这些知识
you know we have to share them heads and tails or all of these things that we did

997
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,319
尾巴或我们所做的所有这些事情都可以直接将其绘制成图形
you know we have to share them heads and tails or all of these things that we did

998
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:54,539
尾巴或我们所做的所有这些事情都可以直接将其绘制成图形
tails or all of these things that we did could directly graphs this is

999
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:54,549
尾巴或我们所做的所有这些事情都可以直接将其绘制成图形
could directly graphs this is independent of not given X B when every

path from this set of notes the result of not just passed through the xB notes

1003
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:05,029
不仅可以通过xB注释传递，还可以，所以基本上
path from this set of notes the result of not just passed through the xB notes

1004
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,609
不仅可以通过xB注释传递，还可以，所以基本上
of not just passed through the xB notes okay so basically the concept of

1005
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:08,619
不仅可以通过xB注释传递，还可以，所以基本上
okay so basically the concept of conditional independence becomes a graph

1006
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:11,339
条件独立成为图论概念好
okay so basically the concept of conditional independence becomes a graph

1007
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:13,140
条件独立成为图论概念好
conditional independence becomes a graph theoretic concept okay

1008
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:13,150
条件独立成为图论概念好
theoretic concept okay it has nothing to do with any particular

1009
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,079
它与我们所见过的任何特定的三角洲无关
theoretic concept okay it has nothing to do with any particular

1010
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,059
它与我们所见过的任何特定的三角洲无关
it has nothing to do with any particular the Delta we have seen for directed

1011
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:18,069
它与我们所见过的任何特定的三角洲无关
the Delta we have seen for directed graphs

1012
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:20,099
图表
the Delta we have seen for directed graphs

1013
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:20,680
我想看看这个方程式并告诉我你知道的位置吗
the Delta we have seen for directed graphs

1014
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:20,690
我想看看这个方程式并告诉我你知道的位置吗


1015
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:27,400
我想看看这个方程式并告诉我你知道的位置吗
is this a position where I wants to look at this equation and telling me you know

1016
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:27,410
我想看看这个方程式并告诉我你知道的位置吗
at this equation and telling me you know so basically what I say here we have two

1017
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,350
所以基本上我在这里说的是，我们在图上有两个节点，我假设
at this equation and telling me you know so basically what I say here we have two

1018
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,110
所以基本上我在这里说的是，我们在图上有两个节点，我假设
so basically what I say here we have two nodes on the graph and I'm assuming that

1019
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,120
所以基本上我在这里说的是，我们在图上有两个节点，我假设
nodes on the graph and I'm assuming that they're not connected via net so another

1020
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,590
他们没有通过网络连接，所以另一个给一个没有连接的J是这个
nodes on the graph and I'm assuming that they're not connected via net so another

1021
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:39,850
他们没有通过网络连接，所以另一个给一个没有连接的J是这个
they're not connected via net so another going give a no J not connected is this

1022
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:39,860
他们没有通过网络连接，所以另一个给一个没有连接的J是这个
going give a no J not connected is this equation based on my graph support the

1023
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,090
基于我的图的方程式支持此条件独立性
going give a no J not connected is this equation based on my graph support the

1024
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,950
基于我的图的方程式支持此条件独立性
equation based on my graph support the got this condition independence

1025
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:44,960
基于我的图的方程式支持此条件独立性
got this condition independence condition is this correct if I and J are

1026
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,940
如果I和J没有正确连接，则条件是正确的。
got this condition independence condition is this correct if I and J are

1027
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,850
如果I和J没有正确连接，则条件是正确的。
condition is this correct if I and J are not connected right every part from I to

1028
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:54,860
如果I和J没有正确连接，则条件是正确的。
not connected right every part from I to J has to go through what I steer J is

1029
00:36:54,860 --> 00:37:01,660
J必须经历我的指导J在那里，它们不是唯一的连接方式
not connected right every part from I to J has to go through what I steer J is

1030
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,520
J必须经历我的指导J在那里，它们不是唯一的连接方式
J has to go through what I steer J is there they're not connected the only way

1031
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:03,530
J必须经历我的指导J在那里，它们不是唯一的连接方式
there they're not connected the only way to go is through the other node right

1032
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:08,410
要经过另一个节点，就必须经过任何
there they're not connected the only way to go is through the other node right

1033
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,940
要经过另一个节点，就必须经过任何
to go is through the other node right you have to go through whatever the

1034
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:09,950
要经过另一个节点，就必须经过任何
you have to go through whatever the other nodes and immediately we know if

1035
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,330
其他节点，我们立即知道其他节点是否像您一样给予我们
you have to go through whatever the other nodes and immediately we know if

1036
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,430
其他节点，我们立即知道其他节点是否像您一样给予我们
other nodes and immediately we know if the other nodes are given like you we

1037
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:15,440
其他节点，我们立即知道其他节点是否像您一样给予我们
the other nodes are given like you we condition they're then given various

1038
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,180
然后它们被赋予各种xixj必须独立的条件
the other nodes are given like you we condition they're then given various

1039
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:25,330
然后它们被赋予各种xixj必须独立的条件
condition they're then given various xixj have to be independent you see

1040
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,210
我是说我们说对的夫妇，但这是独立的，如果给定XP
condition they're then given various xixj have to be independent you see

1041
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:26,220
我是说我们说对的夫妇，但这是独立的，如果给定XP


1042
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:33,950
我是说我们说对的夫妇，但这是独立的，如果给定XP
I mean the couple we said right but this is independent that if a given XP if

1043
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:33,960
我是说我们说对的夫妇，但这是独立的，如果给定XP
is independent that if a given XP if every part from here to there has to

1044
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,630
从这里到那里的每个部分都必须经过它，因为XP
is independent that if a given XP if every part from here to there has to

1045
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,790
从这里到那里的每个部分都必须经过它，因为XP
every part from here to there has to pass through it to be because XP would

1046
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:37,800
从这里到那里的每个部分都必须经过它，因为XP
pass through it to be because XP would block it so he heard if I and J don't

1047
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,420
阻止它，所以他听说如果我和J不占优势，我可以声称他们
pass through it to be because XP would block it so he heard if I and J don't

1048
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,600
阻止它，所以他听说如果我和J不占优势，我可以声称他们
block it so he heard if I and J don't hold an edge I can claim that their

1049
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:44,610
阻止它，所以他听说如果我和J不占优势，我可以声称他们
hold an edge I can claim that their condition independent given the rest of

1050
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,280
给定其余节点，则条件独立，因为我唯一的方法是
hold an edge I can claim that their condition independent given the rest of

1051
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,500
给定其余节点，则条件独立，因为我唯一的方法是
condition independent given the rest of the nodes because the only way I can

1052
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:48,510
给定其余节点，则条件独立，因为我唯一的方法是
the nodes because the only way I can work for my DJ is through the rest of

1053
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,480
我的DJ的工作是通过弹出的其余节点进行的，因此
the nodes because the only way I can work for my DJ is through the rest of

1054
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,070
我的DJ的工作是通过弹出的其余节点进行的，因此
work for my DJ is through the rest of the nodes which that pop okay so the

1055
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,080
我的DJ的工作是通过弹出的其余节点进行的，因此
the nodes which that pop okay so the addition is I am writing this as a

1056
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,980
另外，我正在将其写为经过认证的通用药物
the nodes which that pop okay so the addition is I am writing this as a

1057
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,280
另外，我正在将其写为经过认证的通用药物
addition is I am writing this as a certified generic

1058
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:01,290
如果您喜欢这是一个有条件的条件独立关系，但我不会
certified generic

1059
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:06,410
如果您喜欢这是一个有条件的条件独立关系，但我不会
if you like it's an eric conditional independence relation but I won't desk a

1060
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:06,420
如果您喜欢这是一个有条件的条件独立关系，但我不会
independence relation but I won't desk a to motivate the concept that the joint

1061
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,870
激发可以写出联合概率分布的概念
independence relation but I won't desk a to motivate the concept that the joint

1062
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,880
激发可以写出联合概率分布的概念
to motivate the concept that the joint probability distribution can be written

1063
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:10,890
激发可以写出联合概率分布的概念
probability distribution can be written as a product or potential but each of

1064
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:13,400
作为一种产品或潜力，但他们各自拒绝更好地单击“确定”，
probability distribution can be written as a product or potential but each of

1065
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,860
作为一种产品或潜力，但他们各自拒绝更好地单击“确定”，
as a product or potential but each of them is declined to better click OK and

1066
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:17,870
作为一种产品或潜力，但他们各自拒绝更好地单击“确定”，
them is declined to better click OK and so this relation or pretentious defined

1067
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,110
因此，集团之间的这种关系或自命不凡的定义是一种
them is declined to better click OK and so this relation or pretentious defined

1068
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:24,320
因此，集团之间的这种关系或自命不凡的定义是一种
so this relation or pretentious defined over the clique is sort of a way to

1069
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,330
因此，集团之间的这种关系或自命不凡的定义是一种
over the clique is sort of a way to implicitly enforce the independence

1070
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,050
隐式地执行您在那里看到的独立关系，所以
over the clique is sort of a way to implicitly enforce the independence

1071
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:33,710
隐式地执行您在那里看到的独立关系，所以
implicitly enforce the independence relation that you see up there okay so

1072
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:33,720
隐式地执行您在那里看到的独立关系，所以
relation that you see up there okay so let's see what I don't know when I go on

1073
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,550
让我们看看我什么时候不知道，因为我们已经下巴了
relation that you see up there okay so let's see what I don't know when I go on

1074
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,990
让我们看看我什么时候不知道，因为我们已经下巴了
let's see what I don't know when I go on this thing because we already have chin

1075
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,000
让我们看看我什么时候不知道，因为我们已经下巴了
this thing because we already have chin it okay so an example with some notes

1076
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,520
没关系，所以有一些注释的例子，看看我们在这里有多少点击，所以
this thing because we already have chin it okay so an example with some notes

1077
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,460
没关系，所以有一些注释的例子，看看我们在这里有多少点击，所以
it okay so an example with some notes and see what clicks we have here so the

1078
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:48,470
没关系，所以有一些注释的例子，看看我们在这里有多少点击，所以
and see what clicks we have here so the this of the edges of the graph so the

1079
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:51,350
图的边缘，所以头部的唯一连接是
and see what clicks we have here so the this of the edges of the graph so the

1080
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,670
图的边缘，所以头部的唯一连接是
this of the edges of the graph so the only connection of the head is between

1081
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:52,680
图的边缘，所以头部的唯一连接是
only connection of the head is between x1 and x4 okay

1082
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,650
x1和x4好的，所以这里有一个单击
only connection of the head is between x1 and x4 okay

1083
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:59,210
x1和x4好的，所以这里有一个单击
x1 and x4 okay so there are this is a click alright one

1084
00:38:59,210 --> 00:38:59,220
x1和x4好的，所以这里有一个单击
so there are this is a click alright one click X 1 X 2 X 3 is another click

1085
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:05,320
click X 1 X 2 X 3是另一个click expiry export是另一个希腊权利，
so there are this is a click alright one click X 1 X 2 X 3 is another click

1086
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,910
click X 1 X 2 X 3是另一个click expiry export是另一个希腊权利，
click X 1 X 2 X 3 is another click expiry export is another Greek right and

1087
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:07,920
click X 1 X 2 X 3是另一个click expiry export是另一个希腊权利，
expiry export is another Greek right and so the maximal cliques place take care

1088
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,500
所以最大派系的地方要照顾3号的大小，所以我会写成
expiry export is another Greek right and so the maximal cliques place take care

1089
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:14,960
所以最大派系的地方要照顾3号的大小，所以我会写成
so the maximal cliques place take care of size of size 3 so I will write the

1090
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:14,970
所以最大派系的地方要照顾3号的大小，所以我会写成
of size of size 3 so I will write the Joint Distribution we write it as

1091
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,490
联合分布我们将其写为在其上定义的势的乘积
of size of size 3 so I will write the Joint Distribution we write it as

there okay Austin all right this is the composition that we see

1150
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:04,940
奥斯汀，好吧，这就是我们所看到的组成
this is the composition that we see there is not unique all right so

1151
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,319
没有唯一的权利，所以有时候你知道你知道你可以
this is the composition that we see there is not unique all right so

1152
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,650
没有唯一的权利，所以有时候你知道你知道你可以
there is not unique all right so sometimes you know you you know you can

1153
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:11,660

with some all the ways to express this discrete potential so this decomposition

1157
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:20,319
离散电位，因此此分解不必是唯一的，但现在

1160
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:24,700
这不是问题，因为在一天结束时，您对

that's not an issue because at the end of the day you're interested on

1162
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:26,799
这不是问题，因为在一天结束时，您对
of the day you're interested on joint distribution so let's try and do

1163
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:30,870
联合分布，所以让我们尝试做一个简单的三个节点的例子
of the day you're interested on joint distribution so let's try and do

1164
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:34,160
联合分布，所以让我们尝试做一个简单的三个节点的例子
joint distribution so let's try and do one example of simple three nodes okay

1165
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,170
联合分布，所以让我们尝试做一个简单的三个节点的例子
one example of simple three nodes okay and stick this what we can represent

1166
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:38,519
并坚持下去，我们可以用自己可以表示的方式来代表这一点，所以
one example of simple three nodes okay and stick this what we can represent

1167
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,919
并坚持下去，我们可以用自己可以表示的方式来代表这一点，所以
and stick this what we can represent this in terms of put themselves okay so

1168
00:41:40,919 --> 00:41:40,929
并坚持下去，我们可以用自己可以表示的方式来代表这一点，所以
this in terms of put themselves okay so one where it is I

1169
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:42,620
我要去的地方我猜只有一个
this in terms of put themselves okay so one where it is I

1170
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,269
我要去的地方我猜只有一个
one where it is I I'm gonna guess there is only enough

1171
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:45,279
我要去的地方我猜只有一个
I'm gonna guess there is only enough separation in conditional independence

1172
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:48,599
条件独立关系中的分离在这里给出了YX的踪迹
I'm gonna guess there is only enough separation in conditional independence

1173
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,299
条件独立关系中的分离在这里给出了YX的踪迹
separation in conditional independence relation here the trace that given Y X

1174
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:51,309
条件独立关系中的分离在这里给出了YX的踪迹
relation here the trace that given Y X and z are independent

1175
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:52,559
和z是独立的，所以当我尝试强制执行此操作时，
relation here the trace that given Y X and z are independent

1176
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,339
和z是独立的，所以当我尝试强制执行此操作时，
and z are independent okay so when I try to enforce this and

1177
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:56,349
和z是独立的，所以当我尝试强制执行此操作时，
okay so when I try to enforce this and see that this expression actually leads

1178
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:59,219
看到这个表达式实际上导致了带有泄漏的分解。
okay so when I try to enforce this and see that this expression actually leads

1179
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:01,859
看到这个表达式实际上导致了带有泄漏的分解。
see that this expression actually leads to decomposition of with leaks of the

1180
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:01,869
看到这个表达式实际上导致了带有泄漏的分解。
to decomposition of with leaks of the Joint Distribution so what you see here

1181
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:04,019
联合分布，所以您在此处看到的是x和y的P，而z等于
to decomposition of with leaks of the Joint Distribution so what you see here

1182
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:07,799
联合分布，所以您在此处看到的是x和y的P，而z等于
Joint Distribution so what you see here is P of x and y and z is equal to that

1183
00:42:07,799 --> 00:42:07,809
联合分布，所以您在此处看到的是x和y的P，而z等于
is P of x and y and z is equal to that so this equation that you see in the

1184
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:09,959
因此，您在中间看到的这个等式证明食物是没有道理的
is P of x and y and z is equal to that so this equation that you see in the

1185
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:12,179
因此，您在中间看到的这个等式证明食物是没有道理的
so this equation that you see in the middle you justify that food there's no

1186
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:12,189
因此，您在中间看到的这个等式证明食物是没有道理的
middle you justify that food there's no nothing assumption there but I simplify

1187
00:42:12,189 --> 00:42:15,660
那里没有任何假设，但我简化了，我说给定x和y的Z的P是P
middle you justify that food there's no nothing assumption there but I simplify

1188
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,620
那里没有任何假设，但我简化了，我说给定x和y的Z的P是P
nothing assumption there but I simplify and I say that P of Z given x and y is P

1189
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:19,630
那里没有任何假设，但我简化了，我说给定x和y的Z的P是P
and I say that P of Z given x and y is P of Z given Y what can I use to do this I

1190
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:24,769
给定Y的Z值，我该怎么做呢？我使用独立关系好吗
and I say that P of Z given x and y is P of Z given Y what can I use to do this I

1191
00:42:24,769 --> 00:42:28,679
给定Y的Z值，我该怎么做呢？我使用独立关系好吗
of Z given Y what can I use to do this I use the independence relation okay all

1192
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:28,689
给定Y的Z值，我该怎么做呢？我使用独立关系好吗
use the independence relation okay all right effectively what I can do is I can

1193
00:42:28,689 --> 00:42:32,640
我可以做的就是有效地将这些东西结合在一起
use the independence relation okay all right effectively what I can do is I can

1194
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,949
我可以做的就是有效地将这些东西结合在一起
right effectively what I can do is I can combine those things together and this

1195
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:34,959
我可以做的就是有效地将这些东西结合在一起
combine those things together and this becomes the joint affection of Y and

1196
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:36,749
成为Y的共同情感，这成为Z给定的条件
combine those things together and this becomes the joint affection of Y and

1197
00:42:36,749 --> 00:42:40,049
成为Y的共同情感，这成为Z给定的条件

it great it's - okay so it's do so well then I have to work here with potentials

1353
00:47:59,950 --> 00:47:59,960
很好-好的，所以做得很好，然后我必须在这里发挥潜力
then I have to work here with potentials but involve basically two tables that

defining the potential are unknown in general all right but I'm going to write

1363
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,430
一般没事，但是我将其写为潜力的产物，
defining the potential are unknown in general all right but I'm going to write

1364
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:24,540
一般没事，但是我将其写为潜力的产物，

1365
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:24,550
一般没事，但是我将其写为潜力的产物，
this as a product of potentials and remember the potentials need to be

1366
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:26,740
记住潜力需要是积极的，因为当你把它们
this as a product of potentials and remember the potentials need to be

1367
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,540
记住潜力需要是积极的，因为当你把它们
remember the potentials need to be positive because when you put them

1368
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:28,550
记住潜力需要是积极的，因为当你把它们
positive because when you put them together you need to give the

1369
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:30,040
您需要一起给出概率分布和简单的方法
positive because when you put them together you need to give the

1370
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,680
您需要一起给出概率分布和简单的方法
together you need to give the probability distribution and an easy way

1371
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:32,690
您需要一起给出概率分布和简单的方法
probability distribution and an easy way to make them positive is to write them

1372
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:35,560
使它们变得积极的是将它们写为e，具有某种能力，好吧，这是
probability distribution and an easy way to make them positive is to write them

1373
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:41,320
使它们变得积极的是将它们写为e，具有某种能力，好吧，这是
to make them positive is to write them as e to some power okay this is sort of

1374
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:41,330
使它们变得积极的是将它们写为e，具有某种能力，好吧，这是
as e to some power okay this is sort of a very typical of disposable type of

1375
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:44,530
这是非常典型的一次性分配类型，因此我在这里写
as e to some power okay this is sort of a very typical of disposable type of

1376
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:49,150
这是非常典型的一次性分配类型，因此我在这里写
a very typical of disposable type of distribution so here I am writing its

1377
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:49,160
这是非常典型的一次性分配类型，因此我在这里写
distribution so here I am writing its potential as e to the PI J that connects

1378
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,960
电位e到连接节点XI和XJ的PI J的电位，所以我的电位是
distribution so here I am writing its potential as e to the PI J that connects

1379
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,400
电位e到连接节点XI和XJ的PI J的电位，所以我的电位是
potential as e to the PI J that connects nodes X I and X J so my potential is

1380
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:57,410
电位e到连接节点XI和XJ的PI J的电位，所以我的电位是
nodes X I and X J so my potential is really not the price today is to e to

1381
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:00,310
今天的价格真的不是等于e等于PI J的某个函数
nodes X I and X J so my potential is really not the price today is to e to

1382
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:03,190

really not the price today is to e to the theta equal to PI J some function

1383
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:03,200
今天的价格真的不是等于e等于PI J的某个函数
the theta equal to PI J some function because that way the function can be

1384
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,290
因为那样函数可以是正的也可以是负的
the theta equal to PI J some function because that way the function can be

1385
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:08,140
因为那样函数可以是正的也可以是负的
because that way the function can be positive or negative but e to the T PI J

1386
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:08,150
因为那样函数可以是正的也可以是负的
positive or negative but e to the T PI J will always be positive

1387
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,340
永远是积极的，我基本上只是在制定公式，所以我
positive or negative but e to the T PI J will always be positive

1388
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,850
永远是积极的，我基本上只是在制定公式，所以我
will always be positive I'm just very formulating basically so I

1389
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:12,860
永远是积极的，我基本上只是在制定公式，所以我
I'm just very formulating basically so I don't have to worry about something

1390
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,110
不必担心负面的影响，好吧，另一个好处是
I'm just very formulating basically so I don't have to worry about something

00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:19,330
不必担心负面的影响，好吧，另一个好处是
don't have to worry about something being negative okay another advantage is

1392
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:19,340
不必担心负面的影响，好吧，另一个好处是
being negative okay another advantage is if you write this as product of this

1393
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,430
如果您将此代码编写为此指数函数的乘积
being negative okay another advantage is if you write this as product of this

1394
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,010
如果您将此代码编写为此指数函数的乘积
if you write this as product of this exponential function when you might have

so the this comes to be because because just to do with the independent

1473
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:05,089
所以这是因为因为与独立
just to do with the independent relations but I didn't have to tell you

好的
independence relation will not be born okay

1496
00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:53,720
所以这个预防台的名字是什么，所以你知道，因为我们有
independence relation will not be born okay

1497
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:53,730
所以这个预防台的名字是什么，所以你知道，因为我们有


1498
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:58,340
所以这个预防台的名字是什么，所以你知道，因为我们有
so what's the name of this prevention table plate so you know because we have

1499
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:58,350
所以这个预防台的名字是什么，所以你知道，因为我们有
table plate so you know because we have their condition distributions now you

1500
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:01,250
他们的条件分布现在你知道如果我写这是相同的例子
table plate so you know because we have their condition distributions now you

1501
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:05,060
他们的条件分布现在你知道如果我写这是相同的例子
their condition distributions now you know if I write this is the same example

1502
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:05,070
他们的条件分布现在你知道如果我写这是相同的例子
know if I write this is the same example that we had before if I write this in

1503
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:07,160
如果我用潜力来写这些，这些是我们以前所拥有的
know if I write this is the same example that we had before if I write this in

1504
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,320
如果我用潜力来写这些，这些是我们以前所拥有的
that we had before if I write this in terms of potentials these potentials of

1505
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:09,330
如果我用潜力来写这些，这些是我们以前所拥有的
terms of potentials these potentials of two nodes two variables two variables

1506
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,960
两个节点两个变量两个变量两个然后三个这不是
terms of potentials these potentials of two nodes two variables two variables

1507
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,090
两个节点两个变量两个变量两个然后三个这不是
two nodes two variables two variables two then three this are not

1508
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:14,100
两个节点两个变量两个变量两个然后三个这不是
two then three this are not probabilities okay and they express

1509
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:19,000
概率还可以，它们表示变量之间的相关性，因此
two then three this are not probabilities okay and they express

1510
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,020
概率还可以，它们表示变量之间的相关性，因此
probabilities okay and they express correlations between variables so

1511
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:21,030
概率还可以，它们表示变量之间的相关性，因此
correlations between variables so example you see the anthem let's like

1512
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:23,510
例如，您看到了国歌，就像这样，是离散变量，您可以看到吗
correlations between variables so example you see the anthem let's like

1513
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:26,060
例如，您看到了国歌，就像这样，是离散变量，您可以看到吗
example you see the anthem let's like this are discrete variables can you see

1514
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:26,070
例如，您看到了国歌，就像这样，是离散变量，您可以看到吗
this are discrete variables can you see an element there that is very small

1515
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,620
那里的一个很小的元素意味着特定的变量集
this are discrete variables can you see an element there that is very small

1516
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,600
那里的一个很小的元素意味着特定的变量集
an element there that is very small means the particular set of variables

1517
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:29,610
那里的一个很小的元素意味着特定的变量集
means the particular set of variables are not correlated with each other but

1518
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,640
彼此不相关，但是许多P可能是某种东西
means the particular set of variables are not correlated with each other but

1519
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,880
彼此不相关，但是许多P可能是某种东西
are not correlated with each other but many P potentially it's something

1520
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:34,890
彼此不相关，但是许多P可能是某种东西
many P potentially it's something computationally we need to worry because

1521
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:36,590
在计算上，我们需要担心，因为这些因素没有被归一化，您可能会
many P potentially it's something computationally we need to worry because

1522
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:40,670
在计算上，我们需要担心，因为这些因素没有被归一化，您可能会
computationally we need to worry because this factors are not normalized you may

1523
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:40,680
在计算上，我们需要担心，因为这些因素没有被归一化，您可能会
this factors are not normalized you may have a problem when you do computation

1524
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,710
在进行计算并影响共享参数时会遇到问题
this factors are not normalized you may have a problem when you do computation

1525
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:44,360
在进行计算并影响共享参数时会遇到问题
have a problem when you do computation and influence that share parameters

1526
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:44,370
在进行计算并影响共享参数时会遇到问题
and influence that share parameters because maybe this potential here is way

1527
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:50,510
因为也许这里的潜力远比那高得多
and influence that share parameters because maybe this potential here is way

1528
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:52,250
因为也许这里的潜力远比那高得多
because maybe this potential here is way at much higher values than that

1529
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:52,260
因为也许这里的潜力远比那高得多
at much higher values than that potential there that doesn't imply that

1530
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,950
潜力，但这并不意味着该值基本上是性X
at much higher values than that potential there that doesn't imply that

1531
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:57,200
潜力，但这并不意味着该值基本上是性X
potential there that doesn't imply that the value were sexual X still basically

1532
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:57,210
潜力，但这并不意味着该值基本上是性X
the value were sexual X still basically dominate the distribution simply this

1533
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:00,020
仅仅因为发生这种情况就可以控制分布，因为您已经对其进行了归一化
the value were sexual X still basically dominate the distribution simply this

1534
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,000
仅仅因为发生这种情况就可以控制分布，因为您已经对其进行了归一化
dominate the distribution simply this happens because you have a normalize it

1535
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,010
仅仅因为发生这种情况就可以控制分布，因为您已经对其进行了归一化
happens because you have a normalize it so you need to be careful when you do

1536
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,790
因此在进行推断时需要小心，因为这可能是
happens because you have a normalize it so you need to be careful when you do

1537
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:07,550
因此在进行推断时需要小心，因为这可能是
so you need to be careful when you do inference because this terms may be

1538
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:07,560
因此在进行推断时需要小心，因为这可能是
inference because this terms may be completely honest in the calculation

1539
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,790
在计算中完全诚实，因为它们不太可能
inference because this terms may be completely honest in the calculation

1540
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:13,250
在计算中完全诚实，因为它们不太可能
completely honest in the calculation because they are not probabilities okay

1541
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:13,260
在计算中完全诚实，因为它们不太可能
because they are not probabilities okay in some sense this can be a problem you

1542
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,470
从某种意义上说，这可能是一个问题，您要知道所有任务是什么
because they are not probabilities okay in some sense this can be a problem you

1543
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:18,770
从某种意义上说，这可能是一个问题，您要知道所有任务是什么
in some sense this can be a problem you know depending what the task is from all

1544
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:18,780
从某种意义上说，这可能是一个问题，您要知道所有任务是什么
know depending what the task is from all locations you may want to take advantage

1545
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,510
您可能想利用的位置
know depending what the task is from all locations you may want to take advantage

00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:42,810
捕获邻居之间的某种相关性，如果这是加一，
neighbors so if this is plus one you know in thesis you say spin up for

1587
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:45,170
在论文中知道你说例如在量子力学中自旋，所以如果这

example in quantum mechanics so if this is plus one then the neighbors tend to

1590
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,020
是加一，那么邻居往往是加一，所以相应的身体是

1591
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:54,320
是加一，那么邻居往往是加一，所以相应的身体是

1596
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,430
得到这个加一个更高的转移叫喊这个加一个和这张桌子
least plus one the sky of chance of getting this plus one in higher transfer

1597
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:03,230
得到这个加一个更高的转移叫喊这个加一个和这张桌子
getting this plus one in higher transfer yelling this plus one and this table

1598
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:03,240
得到这个加一个更高的转移叫喊这个加一个和这张桌子
yelling this plus one and this table step also look to represent that not in

1599
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,750
步骤还试图表示它不是在概率的上下文中，而是

you know the potential so you can see here for example if this is minus one

1607
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:21,220
你知道潜力，所以你可以在这里看到例如，如果这是负一
here for example if this is minus one the probability of xn minus 1 B minus 1

1608
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,780
xn减去1 B减去1的概率我是说，所以概率无除法
here for example if this is minus one the probability of xn minus 1 B minus 1

1609
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,180
xn减去1 B减去1的概率我是说，所以概率无除法

1610
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:27,190
xn减去1 B减去1的概率我是说，所以概率无除法
I mean so the probability is no divide of the prevention is much higher than

1611
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,490
预防的价值远高于完成价值的可能性
I mean so the probability is no divide of the prevention is much higher than

1612
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,560
预防的价值远高于完成价值的可能性
of the prevention is much higher than the probability of done the value of

预防的价值远高于完成价值的可能性
the probability of done the value of excitements ought to be point two okay

1614
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:33,720
激动应该是第二点好，我必须纠正自己，这是一个

1616
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:36,310
激动应该是第二点好，我必须纠正自己，这是一个
again I have to correct myself there's a lot probabilities then you notice they

1617
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,250
很多概率，那么您会发现它们基本上不会在任何方向上相加

1679
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:49,869
如果你给邻居，就别无选择，因为
way to go anywhere else because all paths will be blocked okay so the Markov

1680
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:52,589
路径将被阻止，所以无向图的马尔可夫毯是
way to go anywhere else because all paths will be blocked okay so the Markov

1681
00:58:52,589 --> 00:58:57,120

1682
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:57,130
路径将被阻止，所以无向图的马尔可夫毯是

01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:08,589
这样分配危机的唯一方法是
never be able to exactly model a distribution of a crisis this way the

1807
01:03:08,589 --> 01:03:10,900
这样分配危机的唯一方法是
distribution of a crisis this way the only way you can do this is by having a

1808
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:10,910
这样分配危机的唯一方法是
only way you can do this is by having a maximal clique that has all four nodes

1809
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:13,270
具有所有四个节点的最大集团，这个杂色只能是它们中的一个
only way you can do this is by having a maximal clique that has all four nodes

1810
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:15,760
具有所有四个节点的最大集团，这个杂色只能是它们中的一个
maximal clique that has all four nodes and this much motley can only be of they

1811
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:15,770
具有所有四个节点的最大集团，这个杂色只能是它们中的一个
and this much motley can only be of they if you moralized the dialectic block

1812
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:20,490
如果你把辩证法道德化，好吧，我想我会回到
and this much motley can only be of they if you moralized the dialectic block

1813
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:23,740
如果你把辩证法道德化，好吧，我想我会回到
if you moralized the dialectic block okay I think I'm going to go back to

1814
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:23,750
如果你把辩证法道德化，好吧，我想我会回到
okay I think I'm going to go back to show you some cases of directed graphs

1815
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:27,460
向您展示一些有向图的情况，但是您无法提出
okay I think I'm going to go back to show you some cases of directed graphs

1816
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,859
向您展示一些有向图的情况，但是您无法提出
show you some cases of directed graphs but there is no way you can come up with

1817
01:03:29,859 --> 01:03:29,869
向您展示一些有向图的情况，但是您无法提出
but there is no way you can come up with an equivalent undirected graph but right

1818
01:03:29,869 --> 01:03:33,190
一个等效的无向图，但是现在对于这个问题，您只是瘫痪了
but there is no way you can come up with an equivalent undirected graph but right

1819
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:35,500
一个等效的无向图，但是现在对于这个问题，您只是瘫痪了
an equivalent undirected graph but right now for this problem you just paralyze

1820
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:35,510
一个等效的无向图，但是现在对于这个问题，您只是瘫痪了
now for this problem you just paralyze the parent and Verity okay so so here's

1821
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:41,079
父母和Verity可以，所以如果有这个，这是另一个例子
now for this problem you just paralyze the parent and Verity okay so so here's

1822
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:44,079
父母和Verity可以，所以如果有这个，这是另一个例子
the parent and Verity okay so so here's another example if you have this

1823
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:44,089
父母和Verity可以，所以如果有这个，这是另一个例子
another example if you have this directed graph

1824
01:03:44,089 --> 01:03:46,660
有向图
another example if you have this directed graph

PF下一个具有平衡，即给定x1 x 4p f x3没有父级且
the given x1 x 4p f x3 has no parent and then explore given x2 and x3 okay so so

1829
01:03:53,039 --> 01:04:00,109
然后探索给定的x2和x3好，所以你在这里注意到你有我的数字2 3
the given x1 x 4p f x3 has no parent and then explore given x2 and x3 okay so so

1830
01:04:00,109 --> 01:04:02,719
然后探索给定的x2和x3好，所以你在这里注意到你有我的数字2 3
then explore given x2 and x3 okay so so you notice here you have my numbers 2 3

1831
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:02,729
然后探索给定的x2和x3好，所以你在这里注意到你有我的数字2 3
you notice here you have my numbers 2 3 &amp; 4

1832
01:04:02,729 --> 01:04:03,319
＆4好吧2 3＆4所以我还是
you notice here you have my numbers 2 3 &amp; 4

1833
01:04:03,319 --> 01:04:05,789
＆4好吧2 3＆4所以我还是
and obviously to get 2 3 &amp; 4 you have to moralize you have to marry the parents 2

1834
01:04:05,789 --> 01:04:11,489
有一个涉及2 3＆4的集团，显然要获得2 3＆4，您必须
and obviously to get 2 3 &amp; 4 you have to moralize you have to marry the parents 2

1835
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:13,370
道德化你必须嫁给父母2＆3，这是潜在的机会
and obviously to get 2 3 &amp; 4 you have to moralize you have to marry the parents 2

1836
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:16,459
道德化你必须嫁给父母2＆3，这是潜在的机会
moralize you have to marry the parents 2 &amp; 3 and this is the line here potential

1837
01:04:16,459 --> 01:04:16,469
道德化你必须嫁给父母2＆3，这是潜在的机会
&amp; 3 and this is the line here potential notice because if I say I'm going to

1838
01:04:16,469 --> 01:04:18,469
注意，因为如果我说我将有潜力2 3＆4
&amp; 3 and this is the line here potential notice because if I say I'm going to

1839
01:04:18,469 --> 01:04:19,909
注意，因为如果我说我将有潜力2 3＆4
notice because if I say I'm going to have a potential 2 3 &amp; 4

1840
01:04:19,909 --> 01:04:19,919
注意，因为如果我说我将有潜力2 3＆4
have a potential 2 3 &amp; 4 in that potential I can take actually

1841
01:04:19,919 --> 01:04:22,359
在这种潜力下，我可以实际利用Experion的这种可能性
have a potential 2 3 &amp; 4 in that potential I can take actually

1842
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,309
在这种潜力下，我可以实际利用Experion的这种可能性
in that potential I can take actually this probability of Experion make it

1843
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:25,319
在这种潜力下，我可以实际利用Experion的这种可能性
this probability of Experion make it popular prevent itself alright so if you

1844
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:28,879
流行防止自己好吧，所以如果你想从左到右我
this probability of Experion make it popular prevent itself alright so if you

1845
01:04:28,879 --> 01:04:30,889
流行防止自己好吧，所以如果你想从左到右我
popular prevent itself alright so if you want to go from the left to the right I

1846
01:04:30,889 --> 01:04:30,899
流行防止自己好吧，所以如果你想从左到右我
want to go from the left to the right I can combine P of X 3 with the

1847
01:04:30,899 --> 01:04:32,959
可以将X 3的P与X 4 X 2 8 3的概率结合起来并定义
want to go from the left to the right I can combine P of X 3 with the

1848
01:04:32,959 --> 01:04:35,899
可以将X 3的P与X 4 X 2 8 3的概率结合起来并定义
can combine P of X 3 with the probability of X 4 X 2 8 3 and define

1849
01:04:35,899 --> 01:04:35,909
可以将X 3的P与X 4 X 2 8 3的概率结合起来并定义
probability of X 4 X 2 8 3 and define this potential and again because X 1 and

1850
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:39,649
这种潜力又一次是因为X 1和X 2是我可以放入的两个节点的派系
probability of X 4 X 2 8 3 and define this potential and again because X 1 and

1851
01:04:39,649 --> 01:04:42,019
这种潜力又一次是因为X 1和X 2是我可以放入的两个节点的派系
this potential and again because X 1 and X 2 is a clique of two nodes I can put

1852
01:04:42,019 --> 01:04:42,029
这种潜力又一次是因为X 1和X 2是我可以放入的两个节点的派系
X 2 is a clique of two nodes I can put these things together as another

1853
01:04:42,029 --> 01:04:43,639
这些东西一起作为另一个潜力，所以我想X 1和X 2这样
X 2 is a clique of two nodes I can put these things together as another

1854
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:47,929
这些东西一起作为另一个潜力，所以我想X 1和X 2这样
these things together as another potential so I want to of X 1 and X 2 so

1855
01:04:47,929 --> 01:04:47,939
这些东西一起作为另一个潜力，所以我想X 1和X 2这样
potential so I want to of X 1 and X 2 so again you have potential to note and

1856
01:04:47,939 --> 01:04:51,379
再次，您有潜力要注意，另一个有三个节点的潜力，
potential so I want to of X 1 and X 2 so again you have potential to note and

1857
01:04:51,379 --> 01:04:54,819
再次，您有潜力要注意，另一个有三个节点的潜力，
again you have potential to note and another potential with three nodes and

1858
01:04:54,819 --> 01:04:54,829
再次，您有潜力要注意，另一个有三个节点的潜力，
another potential with three nodes and this problem before now belongs to non

1859
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:57,889
这个问题以前属于非潜在问题，另一个是任何问题
another potential with three nodes and this problem before now belongs to non

1860
01:04:57,889 --> 01:05:04,669
这个问题以前属于非潜在问题，另一个是任何问题
this problem before now belongs to non potential and another is that any issue

1861
01:05:04,669 --> 01:05:07,700
我的意思是显然，您期望的是，如果您认为此点击是否来自
this problem before now belongs to non potential and another is that any issue

我的意思是显然，您期望的是，如果您认为此点击是否来自


1863
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:14,390
我的意思是显然，您期望的是，如果您认为此点击是否来自
I mean obviously you expect I mean if you think if this clicks are coming from

1864
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:14,400
我的意思是显然，您期望的是，如果您认为此点击是否来自
you think if this clicks are coming from the wave behind were supported late and

1865
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,799
后面的浪潮支撑得很晚，我们在这里带了一堆，
you think if this clicks are coming from the wave behind were supported late and

1866
01:05:15,799 --> 01:05:17,780
后面的浪潮支撑得很晚，我们在这里带了一堆，
the wave behind were supported late and we take a bunch of them here and the

1867
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:17,790
后面的浪潮支撑得很晚，我们在这里带了一堆，
we take a bunch of them here and the boss of them

1868
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:18,859
他们的老板，邻居，显然他们将成为
we take a bunch of them here and the boss of them

1869
01:05:18,859 --> 01:05:20,809
他们的老板，邻居，显然他们将成为
boss of them neighbors obviously they're going to be

1870
01:05:20,809 --> 01:05:20,819
他们的老板，邻居，显然他们将成为
neighbors obviously they're going to be staring some know if they don't say

1871
01:05:20,819 --> 01:05:23,630
盯着一些人知道他们是否不说基本没有必要做
neighbors obviously they're going to be staring some know if they don't say

1872
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:27,500
盯着一些人知道他们是否不说基本没有必要做
staring some know if they don't say basically there is no point of doing a

1873
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:27,510
盯着一些人知道他们是否不说基本没有必要做
basically there is no point of doing a methodology because the problem becomes

1874
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:28,910
方法论，因为问题变得微不足道，所以事实是
basically there is no point of doing a methodology because the problem becomes

1875
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:31,069
方法论，因为问题变得微不足道，所以事实是
methodology because the problem becomes trivial so the fact that there is no

1876
01:05:31,069 --> 01:05:31,079
方法论，因为问题变得微不足道，所以事实是
trivial so the fact that there is no trick here is not an issue you know this

1877
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:33,799
这不是问题，您知道这是此类问题中的典型问题，因此
trivial so the fact that there is no trick here is not an issue you know this

1878
01:05:33,799 --> 01:05:40,099
这不是问题，您知道这是此类问题中的典型问题，因此
trick here is not an issue you know this is typical in this sort of problems so

1879
01:05:40,099 --> 01:05:40,109
这不是问题，您知道这是此类问题中的典型问题，因此
is typical in this sort of problems so let's look actually again for converting

1880
01:05:40,109 --> 01:05:45,380
让我们再来看一次将a直接转换为无向图的过程，
is typical in this sort of problems so let's look actually again for converting

1881
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:47,690
让我们再来看一次将a直接转换为无向图的过程，
let's look actually again for converting a directly to an undirected graph so

1882
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:47,700
让我们再来看一次将a直接转换为无向图的过程，
a directly to an undirected graph so what I have seven nodes this is the

1883
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:51,170
我有七个节点，这是有向图的因式分解，
a directly to an undirected graph so what I have seven nodes this is the

1884
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:53,240
我有七个节点，这是有向图的因式分解，
what I have seven nodes this is the factorization for the directed graph and

1885
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:53,250
我有七个节点，这是有向图的因式分解，
factorization for the directed graph and what I have done is this conditional

1886
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,819
我所做的是我写下的条件分布
factorization for the directed graph and what I have done is this conditional

1887
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:57,980
我所做的是我写下的条件分布
what I have done is this conditional distributions I have written down as a

1888
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:57,990
我所做的是我写下的条件分布
distributions I have written down as a product of joint distributions divided

1889
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:02,049
联合分布除以边际的乘积，如果仔细看
distributions I have written down as a product of joint distributions divided

1890
01:06:02,049 --> 01:06:07,880
联合分布除以边际的乘积，如果仔细看
product of joint distributions divided by marginals and if you look carefully

1891
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:07,890
联合分布除以边际的乘积，如果仔细看
by marginals and if you look carefully of this expressions you will see that on

1892
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:09,890
在这些表达式中，您将看到在分子上我拥有所有乘积
by marginals and if you look carefully of this expressions you will see that on

1893
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:14,960
在这些表达式中，您将看到在分子上我拥有所有乘积
of this expressions you will see that on the numerator I have products of all

1894
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:14,970
在这些表达式中，您将看到在分子上我拥有所有乘积
the numerator I have products of all right divide each of the progress of

1895
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:17,059
右划分您在此处看到的点击交叉路口的每个进度
the numerator I have products of all right divide each of the progress of

1896
01:06:17,059 --> 01:06:22,640
右划分您在此处看到的点击交叉路口的每个进度
right divide each of the progress of click intersections you see here there

1897
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:22,650
右划分您在此处看到的点击交叉路口的每个进度
click intersections you see here there is x1 x3 all right

1898
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:26,920
是x1 x3可以提取3，所以这个游戏基本上是
click intersections you see here there is x1 x3 all right

1899
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:33,349
是x1 x3可以提取3，所以这个游戏基本上是
is x1 x3 all right extract 3 so this play is basically the

1900
01:06:33,349 --> 01:06:33,359
是x1 x3可以提取3，所以这个游戏基本上是
extract 3 so this play is basically the intersection of the two clicks of course

1901
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:35,420
当然，两次点击的相交点最高的一棵树在另一个象限中
extract 3 so this play is basically the intersection of the two clicks of course

1902
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,370
当然，两次点击的相交点最高的一棵树在另一个象限中
intersection of the two clicks of course tallest tree in quadrants another

1903
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:37,380
当然，两次点击的相交点最高的一棵树在另一个象限中
tallest tree in quadrants another intersection there and similarly for the

1904
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:41,000
相交，点击次数也一样4 5 4 6 4 7
tallest tree in quadrants another intersection there and similarly for the

1905
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,280
相交，点击次数也一样4 5 4 6 4 7
intersection there and similarly for the clicks 4 5 4 6 4 7

01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:43,290
相交，点击次数也一样4 5 4 6 4 7
clicks 4 5 4 6 4 7 right you have these intersections later

1907
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:46,900
对，以后我们发展每个人的基本原理时，您会遇到这些交叉点
clicks 4 5 4 6 4 7 right you have these intersections later

1908
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:49,460
对，以后我们发展每个人的基本原理时，您会遇到这些交叉点
right you have these intersections later when we develop everybody's basically

1909
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:49,470
对，以后我们发展每个人的基本原理时，您会遇到这些交叉点
when we develop everybody's basically for influence on general graphs we will

1910
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:52,849
为了影响一般图表，我们将尝试利用这些图表的优势
when we develop everybody's basically for influence on general graphs we will

1911
01:06:52,849 --> 01:06:55,069
为了影响一般图表，我们将尝试利用这些图表的优势
for influence on general graphs we will try to take advantage on how these

1912
01:06:55,069 --> 01:06:55,079
为了影响一般图表，我们将尝试利用这些图表的优势
try to take advantage on how these cliques communicate with each other so

1913
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:57,620
集团之间相互交流，所以这种想法将是
try to take advantage on how these cliques communicate with each other so

1914
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:01,820
集团之间相互交流，所以这种想法将是
cliques communicate with each other so this is sort of this idea will be

1915
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:01,830
集团之间相互交流，所以这种想法将是
this is sort of this idea will be extended all right so this the trivial

1916
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:10,910
扩展了所有的权利，所以这个琐碎的例子我不认为这是一个马尔可夫
this is sort of this idea will be extended all right so this the trivial

1917
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:14,150
扩展了所有的权利，所以这个琐碎的例子我不认为这是一个马尔可夫
extended all right so this the trivial example I don't think it's a Markov

1918
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:14,160
扩展了所有的权利，所以这个琐碎的例子我不认为这是一个马尔可夫
example I don't think it's a Markov chain basically so you know again I

1919
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:19,190
基本上是连锁的，所以您再次知道，我将其结合到潜能上，每个
example I don't think it's a Markov chain basically so you know again I

1920
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:21,770
基本上是连锁的，所以您再次知道，我将其结合到潜能上，每个
chain basically so you know again I combine this to on potential and each of

1921
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:21,780
基本上是连锁的，所以您再次知道，我将其结合到潜能上，每个
combine this to on potential and each of the other conditional distributions two

1922
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:23,360
其他条件分布两种其他可能性偶尔什么也没有
combine this to on potential and each of the other conditional distributions two

1923
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,640
其他条件分布两种其他可能性偶尔什么也没有
the other conditional distributions two other potentials occasional nothing

1924
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:25,650
其他条件分布两种其他可能性偶尔什么也没有
other potentials occasional nothing fancy so here you can remove all the

1925
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:29,300
花式的，所以在这里您可以删除所有箭头，并基本上将此图制作为
other potentials occasional nothing fancy so here you can remove all the

1926
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:31,760
花式的，所以在这里您可以删除所有箭头，并基本上将此图制作为
fancy so here you can remove all the arrows and make basically this graph to

1927
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:31,770
花式的，所以在这里您可以删除所有箭头，并基本上将此图制作为
arrows and make basically this graph to have the same identical independence

1928
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:34,730
具有与直接图形相同的独立关系，即您
arrows and make basically this graph to have the same identical independence

1929
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:36,410
具有与直接图形相同的独立关系，即您
have the same identical independence relations as to direct graph that you

1930
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:36,420
具有与直接图形相同的独立关系，即您
relations as to direct graph that you see on the top so what I have here is I

1931
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:46,910
在顶部看到，所以我在这里有另一个直接III和直接III
relations as to direct graph that you see on the top so what I have here is I

1932
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:49,820
在顶部看到，所以我在这里有另一个直接III和直接III
see on the top so what I have here is I have another direct III and direct III

1933
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:49,830
在顶部看到，所以我在这里有另一个直接III和直接III
have another direct III and direct III and the pol III okay and so can you

1934
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:54,020
和POL III好，所以您能提醒我
have another direct III and direct III and the pol III okay and so can you

1935
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:55,370
和POL III好，所以您能提醒我
and the pol III okay and so can you remind me what's the definition of an

1936
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:55,380
和POL III好，所以您能提醒我
remind me what's the definition of an undirected three obviously some directed

1937
01:07:55,380 --> 01:08:01,280
无向三显然是有向的，使无向图为三
remind me what's the definition of an undirected three obviously some directed

1938
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,840
无向三显然是有向的，使无向图为三
undirected three obviously some directed what makes an undirected graph a three

1939
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,520
它表示从该路径到任意一对节点之间的平均单个路径
undirected three obviously some directed what makes an undirected graph a three

1940
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:06,530
它表示从该路径到任意一对节点之间的平均单个路径


1941
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:11,450
它表示从该路径到任意一对节点之间的平均单个路径
it says the average a single path between any pair of nodes the way from

1942
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:11,460
它表示从该路径到任意一对节点之间的平均单个路径
between any pair of nodes the way from here to there this is the only path to

1943
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,340
从这里到那里，这是从这里到那里的唯一路径
between any pair of nodes the way from here to there this is the only path to

1944
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,620
从这里到那里，这是从这里到那里的唯一路径
here to there this is the only path to go from here to there there's only one

1945
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:15,630
从这里到那里，这是从这里到那里的唯一路径
go from here to there there's only one path okay which is two three

1946
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:20,210
路径还可以，是两个三
go from here to there there's only one path okay which is two three

1947
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:22,390
所以在大胆的环境中，有一个红色的节点让我们在这里和其他每个地方都说这个旋钮
go from here to there there's only one path okay which is two three

1948
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:22,400
所以在大胆的环境中，有一个红色的节点让我们在这里和其他每个地方都说这个旋钮


1949
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:29,420
所以在大胆的环境中，有一个红色的节点让我们在这里和其他每个地方都说这个旋钮
so in audacity there is a red node let's say this knob here and every other

1950
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:29,430
所以在大胆的环境中，有一个红色的节点让我们在这里和其他每个地方都说这个旋钮
say this knob here and every other noxious how many parts only Ron

1951
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:32,960
有害的只有罗恩（Ron）有多少部分，那么导演的关系是什么
say this knob here and every other noxious how many parts only Ron

1952
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,930
有害的只有罗恩（Ron）有多少部分，那么导演的关系是什么
noxious how many parts only Ron so what's the relation of a directed

1953
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:35,940
有害的只有罗恩（Ron）有多少部分，那么导演的关系是什么
so what's the relation of a directed three you think around the elected three

1954
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:37,579
三选民，三思而后行，您还记得-因为居家权
so what's the relation of a directed three you think around the elected three

1955
01:08:37,579 --> 01:08:43,579
三选民，三思而后行，您还记得-因为居家权
three you think around the elected three you remember that - because home right a

1956
01:08:43,579 --> 01:08:43,589
三选民，三思而后行，您还记得-因为居家权
you remember that - because home right a directive 3 - on directory we have to do

1957
01:08:43,589 --> 01:08:47,059
指令3-在目录上，我们必须首先执行电离过程
you remember that - because home right a directive 3 - on directory we have to do

1958
01:08:47,059 --> 01:08:51,640
指令3-在目录上，我们必须首先执行电离过程
directive 3 - on directory we have to do first what process ionization so

1959
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:51,650
指令3-在目录上，我们必须首先执行电离过程
first what process ionization so intensified demonization in the

1960
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:53,750
目录中的强化妖魔化没有任何反应
first what process ionization so intensified demonization in the

1961
01:08:53,750 --> 01:09:02,660
目录中的强化妖魔化没有任何反应
intensified demonization in the directory nothing happened

1962
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:02,670
目录中的强化妖魔化没有任何反应
directory nothing happened ok so basically because there's no

1963
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:05,750
好的，基本上是因为没有动员发生，而是在3 a
directory nothing happened ok so basically because there's no

1964
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:09,970
好的，基本上是因为没有动员发生，而是在3 a
ok so basically because there's no mobilization has happened but in 3 a

1965
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:09,980
好的，基本上是因为没有动员发生，而是在3 a
mobilization has happened but in 3 a purity is like a directory but nodes can

1966
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:15,680
纯净性就像一个目录，但是节点可以具有多个功能，那么
mobilization has happened but in 3 a purity is like a directory but nodes can

1967
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,380
纯净性就像一个目录，但是节点可以具有多个功能，那么
purity is like a directory but nodes can have more than one power so what will

1968
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:18,390
纯净性就像一个目录，但是节点可以具有多个功能，那么
have more than one power so what will happen when I transform a 23 to an

1969
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:20,599
当我将23转换为无向3时发生
have more than one power so what will happen when I transform a 23 to an

1970
01:09:20,599 --> 01:09:23,420
当我将23转换为无向3时发生
happen when I transform a 23 to an undirected 3

1971
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:27,180
例如，要解决这个问题，如果我能做到这一点，我会把它留得很好
happen when I transform a 23 to an undirected 3

1972
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:27,190
例如，要解决这个问题，如果我能做到这一点，我会把它留得很好


1973
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:32,490
例如，要解决这个问题，如果我能做到这一点，我会把它留得很好
so for example to make this around I left it well if I can make it this

1974
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:32,500
例如，要解决这个问题，如果我能做到这一点，我会把它留得很好
left it well if I can make it this another mr. Pony three rights if I

1975
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,560
另一位先生如果我想使其成为无向图，则小马拥有三项权利
left it well if I can make it this another mr. Pony three rights if I

1976
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,860
另一位先生如果我想使其成为无向图，则小马拥有三项权利
another mr. Pony three rights if I wanted to make it an undirected graph

1977
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:36,870
另一位先生如果我想使其成为无向图，则小马拥有三项权利
wanted to make it an undirected graph what is gonna happen here you will

1978
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:41,910
这里会发生什么，您将与父母建立联系，如果您与父母建立联系，
wanted to make it an undirected graph what is gonna happen here you will

1979
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:43,740
这里会发生什么，您将与父母建立联系，如果您与父母建立联系，
what is gonna happen here you will connect the parents and if you connect

1980
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:43,750
这里会发生什么，您将与父母建立联系，如果您与父母建立联系，
connect the parents and if you connect the power is what is going to happen is

1981
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,720
力量将要发生的是，成为一个不是一棵树不，先生，你
connect the parents and if you connect the power is what is going to happen is

1982
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:50,910
力量将要发生的是，成为一个不是一棵树不，先生，你
the power is what is going to happen is that becoming a is not a tree no sir you

1983
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:50,920
力量将要发生的是，成为一个不是一棵树不，先生，你
that becoming a is not a tree no sir you know that to be public because

1984
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,480
知道要公开，因为我们会看到扭曲的影响非常
that becoming a is not a tree no sir you know that to be public because

1985
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,830
知道要公开，因为我们会看到扭曲的影响非常
know that to be public because influences we will see in twist is very

1986
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:55,840
知道要公开，因为我们会看到扭曲的影响非常
influences we will see in twist is very easy all right

1987
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,300
很简单，我们花在第二堂课上，所以如果您
influences we will see in twist is very easy all right

1988
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:00,690
很简单，我们花在第二堂课上，所以如果您
easy all right we spend on lecture two so if you if the

1989
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:00,700
很简单，我们花在第二堂课上，所以如果您
we spend on lecture two so if you if the problem is a directed three PC you can

1990
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:04,080
问题是定向三台PC，您可以将其转换为非定向树，并且
we spend on lecture two so if you if the problem is a directed three PC you can

1991
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,120
问题是定向三台PC，您可以将其转换为非定向树，并且
problem is a directed three PC you can transform it to a non directed tree and

1992
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:06,130
问题是定向三台PC，您可以将其转换为非定向树，并且
transform it to a non directed tree and do everything extremely particularly

1993
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:09,440
如果可以的话，请尽一切可能让您非常失望的树，因为您
transform it to a non directed tree and do everything extremely particularly

1994
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,680
如果可以的话，请尽一切可能让您非常失望的树，因为您
do everything extremely particularly disappointed tree if you can because you

1995
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:13,690
如果可以的话，请尽一切可能让您非常失望的树，因为您
disappointed tree if you can because you wanna lies you get loops a lot is a

1996
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:15,840
想要撒谎，你会经常循环，这是一个问题，有一种方法可以使
disappointed tree if you can because you wanna lies you get loops a lot is a

1997
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,150
想要撒谎，你会经常循环，这是一个问题，有一种方法可以使
wanna lies you get loops a lot is a problem and there is a way to get a

1998
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:18,160
想要撒谎，你会经常循环，这是一个问题，有一种方法可以使
problem and there is a way to get a harvest if you actually transform the

1999
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,580
如果您实际上将诗歌转变为无向图，而是收获
problem and there is a way to get a harvest if you actually transform the

2000
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:24,750
如果您实际上将诗歌转变为无向图，而是收获
harvest if you actually transform the poetry not to an undirected graph but

2001
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:24,760
如果您实际上将诗歌转变为无向图，而是收获
poetry not to an undirected graph but this dr. graph which is another type of

2002
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,180
这个博士图，这是另一种类型的图，如果我们有几个图
poetry not to an undirected graph but this dr. graph which is another type of

2003
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:30,840
这个博士图，这是另一种类型的图，如果我们有几个图
this dr. graph which is another type of graph that you know if we have a few

2004
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:30,850
这个博士图，这是另一种类型的图，如果我们有几个图
graph that you know if we have a few minutes I'm going to show you how it

2005
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:32,580
分钟，我将向您展示它看起来如何
graph that you know if we have a few minutes I'm going to show you how it

the reason you want to make direct loft you don't have to say okay let me select

2012
01:11:13,490 --> 01:11:13,500
你想直接放鸽的原因不必说得好，让我选择
you don't have to say okay let me select this to be there with no and start

2013
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,380
在那里没有，然后开始指向远离那里的箭头
you don't have to say okay let me select this to be there with no and start

2014
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:17,870
在那里没有，然后开始指向远离那里的箭头
this to be there with no and start pointing arrows away from there you know

2015
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:17,880
在那里没有，然后开始指向远离那里的箭头
pointing arrows away from there you know so we go this way and this this way and

2016
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,090
所以我们以这种方式，以这种方式，然后以这种方式，但是你可以
pointing arrows away from there you know so we go this way and this this way and

2017
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:22,850
所以我们以这种方式，以这种方式，然后以这种方式，但是你可以
so we go this way and this this way and then that way in that way but you can

2018
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:22,860
所以我们以这种方式，以这种方式，然后以这种方式，但是你可以
then that way in that way but you can start reading note so you can produce

2019
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:25,160
开始阅读笔记，以便您可以生成实际的有向图，但是它们是
then that way in that way but you can start reading note so you can produce

01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:28,740
开始阅读笔记，以便您可以生成实际的有向图，但是它们是
actually and directed graphs but they're not necessarily equivalent okay I do see

2022
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:32,780
不一定相等，好吧，我确实没有任何理由会引起任何人的兴趣
actually and directed graphs but they're not necessarily equivalent okay I do see

不一定相等，好吧，我确实没有任何理由会引起任何人的兴趣
no reason why anybody will be interested to transform an undirected graph to a

2025
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:38,030
除非当然可以将无向图转换为有向图
no reason why anybody will be interested to transform an undirected graph to a

2026

除非当然可以将无向图转换为有向图
to transform an undirected graph to a directed graph alright unless of course

2027
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:41,730
除非当然可以将无向图转换为有向图
directed graph alright unless of course you are trying to learn the causal

2028
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,460
您正在尝试学习因果关系模型并在那里提供数据
directed graph alright unless of course you are trying to learn the causal

您正在尝试学习因果关系模型并在那里提供数据
you are trying to learn the causal relationship model and given data there

2030
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:47,280
您正在尝试学习因果关系模型并在那里提供数据
relationship model and given data there I can see a region in that case the

2031
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,490
在那种情况下，我可以看到一个问题，这将成为高尔夫球选择
relationship model and given data there I can see a region in that case the

2032
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:51,080
在那种情况下，我可以看到一个问题，这将成为高尔夫球选择
I can see a region in that case the problem will become a golf selection

2033
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:51,090
在那种情况下，我可以看到一个问题，这将成为高尔夫球选择
problem will become a golf selection problem because you'll be asking which

2034
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:53,540
问题，因为您将要问这些图中哪个更好地代表了
problem will become a golf selection problem because you'll be asking which

2035
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:56,030
问题，因为您将要问这些图中哪个更好地代表了
problem because you'll be asking which of these graphs better represents the

2036
01:11:56,030 --> 01:11:56,040
问题，因为您将要问这些图中哪个更好地代表了
of these graphs better represents the data that I collected and that's an

2037
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,010
我收集的数据，这是一个有趣的问题
of these graphs better represents the data that I collected and that's an

2038
01:11:58,010 --> 01:12:03,350
我收集的数据，这是一个有趣的问题
data that I collected and that's an interesting problem all right

2039

2158
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,459
好的，这是原始图像，用户通知非常干净，
ok so here we are this is the original image and user notice is very clean and

2159
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:37,469
好的，这是原始图像，用户通知非常干净，
image and user notice is very clean and let's say you take the original image

2160
01:16:37,469 --> 01:16:41,209
假设您拍摄了原始图像，然后您从黑色干扰到了
image and user notice is very clean and let's say you take the original image

2161
01:16:41,209 --> 01:16:43,070
假设您拍摄了原始图像，然后您从黑色干扰到了
let's say you take the original image and you perturb you know from black to

2162
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:43,080
假设您拍摄了原始图像，然后您从黑色干扰到了
and you perturb you know from black to white white black 10% of the pixel

2163
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:46,220
白色白色黑色像素服务图像的10％，这就是您所需要的
and you perturb you know from black to white white black 10% of the pixel

2164
01:16:46,220 --> 01:17:19,010
白色白色黑色像素服务图像的10％，这就是您所需要的
white white black 10% of the pixel services image and so that's what you

2165
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:19,020
白色白色黑色像素服务图像的10％，这就是您所需要的
services image and so that's what you know so when you do this right you're

2166
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:21,770
知道所以当您正确执行此操作时，您会问您是否要完成
services image and so that's what you know so when you do this right you're

2167
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,390
知道所以当您正确执行此操作时，您会问您是否要完成
know so when you do this right you're asking you know if you want to complete

2168
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:23,400
知道所以当您正确执行此操作时，您会问您是否要完成
asking you know if you want to complete with save this you say so you have X

2169
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,780
与保存这个，你说，所以你给X给Y，你想找到那个
asking you know if you want to complete with save this you say so you have X

2170
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:28,940
与保存这个，你说，所以你给X给Y，你想找到那个
with save this you say so you have X given Y you want to find the x that

2171
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:28,950
与保存这个，你说，所以你给X给Y，你想找到那个
given Y you want to find the x that maximize is that posterior of X given Y

2172
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:31,850
最大化是给定Y的X的后验，因此您做的事情要小得多，因此
given Y you want to find the x that maximize is that posterior of X given Y

2173
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:34,580
最大化是给定Y的X的后验，因此您做的事情要小得多，因此
maximize is that posterior of X given Y so what you do is much smaller so the

2174
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:34,590
最大化是给定Y的X的后验，因此您做的事情要小得多，因此
so what you do is much smaller so the probability is the same has been amazing

2175
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:36,440
概率是相同的，这使系统的能量变得惊人，所以当您
so what you do is much smaller so the probability is the same has been amazing

2176
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,080
概率是相同的，这使系统的能量变得惊人，所以当您
probability is the same has been amazing the energy of the system so when you

2177
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:39,090
概率是相同的，这使系统的能量变得惊人，所以当您
the energy of the system so when you take a picture you can just back you

2178
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:42,590
拍摄一张照片，您就可以轻松完成分享K的能量，现在让
the energy of the system so when you take a picture you can just back you

2179
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:44,870
拍摄一张照片，您就可以轻松完成分享K的能量，现在让
take a picture you can just back you complete the energy you share K now let

2180
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:44,880
拍摄一张照片，您就可以轻松完成分享K的能量，现在让
complete the energy you share K now let me make it wide because the energy goes

2181
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,910
我把它扩大，因为如果能量下降，现在能量就会消失，那么你保持它
complete the energy you share K now let me make it wide because the energy goes

2182
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:48,860
我把它扩大，因为如果能量下降，现在能量就会消失，那么你保持它
me make it wide because the energy goes now if it goes down then you keep it

2183
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:48,870
我把它扩大，因为如果能量下降，现在能量就会消失，那么你保持它
now if it goes down then you keep it wide and the reversal loops through the

2184
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:51,440
宽，导演直接通过像素的反向循环将它们带到
now if it goes down then you keep it wide and the reversal loops through the

2185
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:55,010
宽，导演直接通过像素的反向循环将它们带到
wide and the reversal loops through the pixels right by the director bring them

2186
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:55,020
宽，导演直接通过像素的反向循环将它们带到
pixels right by the director bring them up and down alright until you reach the

2187
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,290
上下移动，直到达到最低能量，您就可以执行此操作
pixels right by the director bring them up and down alright until you reach the

2188
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:59,520
上下移动，直到达到最低能量，您就可以执行此操作
up and down alright until you reach the minimum energy you can do this

2189
01:17:59,520 --> 01:17:59,530
上下移动，直到达到最低能量，您就可以执行此操作
minimum energy you can do this no we

2190
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:02,309
不，我们
minimum energy you can do this no we
