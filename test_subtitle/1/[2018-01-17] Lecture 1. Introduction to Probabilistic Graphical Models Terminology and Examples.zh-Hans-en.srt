这是在特殊情况下或在时间情况下，但哥特可能是一个非常
time context but the goth can be a very abstract entity they have nothing to do

1105
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,440
抽象实体，它们与时间无关，好吗，不是吗
time context but the goth can be a very abstract entity they have nothing to do

1106
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,710
抽象实体，它们与时间无关，好吗，不是吗
abstract entity they have nothing to do with space of time okay so don't you

1107
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:30,720
抽象实体，它们与时间无关，好吗，不是吗
with space of time okay so don't you know again depending on the type of

1108
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,099
根据您感兴趣的事物的类型再次知道
with space of time okay so don't you know again depending on the type of

well so actually you know three lectures

1134
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:22,440
好吧，实际上你知道三堂课
so actually you know three lectures there's no point of discussion one type

1135
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,620
没有讨论的重点，我们将统一开发一种或另一种
so actually you know three lectures there's no point of discussion one type

1136
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,530
没有讨论的重点，我们将统一开发一种或另一种

1137
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:27,540
没有讨论的重点，我们将统一开发一种或另一种
or another we will unify development for all of this at the same time okay

1138
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,000
所有这些同时都可以，我们所代表的图中的节点是
or another we will unify development for all of this at the same time okay

1139
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,470
所有这些同时都可以，我们所代表的图中的节点是
all of this at the same time okay the nodes in the graph we represent are

1140
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:33,480
所有这些同时都可以，我们所代表的图中的节点是
the nodes in the graph we represent are the variables and this is very important

1141
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,200
变量，这非常重要，因为缺少过渡图
the nodes in the graph we represent are the variables and this is very important

00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,299
变量，这非常重要，因为缺少过渡图
the variables and this is very important the lack of transition the graph will

1143
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:38,309
变量，这非常重要，因为缺少过渡图
the lack of transition the graph will imply conditional independence

1144
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,190
如果我有其他方式暗示有条件独立性假设
the lack of transition the graph will imply conditional independence

1145

assumptions in other ways if I have nodes representing random variables and

1147
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:47,530
代表随机变量的节点，我必须取十个变量，而我

代表随机变量的节点，我必须取十个变量，而我
I have to take ten variables and I connected smart evil with every other

1150
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,549
将聪明的邪恶与其他身体世界联系起来，那么毫无意义
I have to take ten variables and I connected smart evil with every other

1151
00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:54,589
将聪明的邪恶与其他身体世界联系起来，那么毫无意义
connected smart evil with every other body world then there's no point of

1152
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:54,599
将聪明的邪恶与其他身体世界联系起来，那么毫无意义
body world then there's no point of doing graphs because that problem

1153
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,380
做图，因为问题的复杂性永远不会让你走
body world then there's no point of doing graphs because that problem

1154
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,089
做图，因为问题的复杂性永远不会让你走
doing graphs because that problem complexity will never allow you to go

1155
00:39:59,089 --> 00:39:59,099
做图，因为问题的复杂性永远不会让你走
complexity will never allow you to go anyway

1156
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:00,210
无论如何，有些地方缺少了一些优势
complexity will never allow you to go anyway

1157
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:04,540
无论如何，有些地方缺少了一些优势
anyway it's somehow some edges are missing that

00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:04,550
无论如何，有些地方缺少了一些优势
it's somehow some edges are missing that implies to military somebody who don't

1159
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:07,090
对军人意味着不依赖地段的全部数量的人

00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:08,600
对军人意味着不依赖地段的全部数量的人
depend on all the volume which the lots what we need to think about so the idea

1162
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,590
我们需要考虑的问题，这样的想法是我们对图形感兴趣，
depend on all the volume which the lots what we need to think about so the idea

1163
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,110
我们需要考虑的问题，这样的想法是我们对图形感兴趣，
what we need to think about so the idea is we are interested in graphs that they

1164
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,120
我们需要考虑的问题，这样的想法是我们对图形感兴趣，
is we are interested in graphs that they are not fully connected right they are

1165
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,550
没有完全连接正确，他们完全连接获得任何东西之一
is we are interested in graphs that they are not fully connected right they are

1167
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:17,750
没有完全连接正确，他们完全连接获得任何东西之一
fully connected one of gaining anything by learning this course right the idea

1168
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:22,090
通过正确学习这门课程，想法不是一切都取决于一切
fully connected one of gaining anything by learning this course right the idea

1169
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,340
通过正确学习这门课程，想法不是一切都取决于一切
by learning this course right the idea is not everything depends on everything

1170
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:24,350
通过正确学习这门课程，想法不是一切都取决于一切
is not everything depends on everything and we need to learn about part of the

1171
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:28,020
我们需要了解我们讨论过的结构问题的一部分
is not everything depends on everything and we need to learn about part of the

1172
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,660
我们需要了解我们讨论过的结构问题的一部分
and we need to learn about part of the structure problem that we discussed the

1173
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:31,670
我们需要了解我们讨论过的结构问题的一部分
structure problem that we discussed the second part of the course but again the

1174
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,420
课程的第二部分，但再次缺少线程是什么
structure problem that we discussed the second part of the course but again the

1175
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,550
课程的第二部分，但再次缺少线程是什么
second part of the course but again the lack of threads is what represents

1176
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:36,560
课程的第二部分，但再次缺少线程是什么
lack of threads is what represents conditional independence assumptions and

1177
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,470
有条件的独立性假设，我们花了两三堂课
lack of threads is what represents conditional independence assumptions and

1178
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,020
有条件的独立性假设，我们花了两三堂课
conditional independence assumptions and we spend two or three lectures to

1179
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,030
有条件的独立性假设，我们花了两三堂课
we spend two or three lectures to discuss that and I will give you a

1180
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,360
讨论这个问题，我会给您一些正式的项目，以解决所有问题
we spend two or three lectures to discuss that and I will give you a

1181
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,670
讨论这个问题，我会给您一些正式的项目，以解决所有问题
discuss that and I will give you a number of formal projects to work on all

1182
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:45,680
讨论这个问题，我会给您一些正式的项目，以解决所有问题
number of formal projects to work on all right so something just let's go from

1183
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,290
好的，所以让我们从右边开始，这是一个有向图
number of formal projects to work on all right so something just let's go from

1184
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:51,390
好的，所以让我们从右边开始，这是一个有向图
right so something just let's go from right in there this is a directed graph

1185
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:51,400
好的，所以让我们从右边开始，这是一个有向图
right in there this is a directed graph I'm gonna give you the terminology in of

1186
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,660
我将在后续幻灯片中为您提供术语，但只是
right in there this is a directed graph I'm gonna give you the terminology in of

1187
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,010
我将在后续幻灯片中为您提供术语，但只是
I'm gonna give you the terminology in of the you know in follow up slide but just

1188
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:00,020
我将在后续幻灯片中为您提供术语，但只是
the you know in follow up slide but just to get things going basically here you

1189
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,910
要使事情基本顺利进行，您可以使用常识解释
the you know in follow up slide but just to get things going basically here you

1190
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,400
要使事情基本顺利进行，您可以使用常识解释
to get things going basically here you can use common sense interpretation for

1191
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,410
要使事情基本顺利进行，您可以使用常识解释
can use common sense interpretation for now you know so all of this are other

1192
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,140
现在您知道了，所有这些都是我们拥有的abcde的其他变量在两个
can use common sense interpretation for now you know so all of this are other

1193
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,110
现在您知道了，所有这些都是我们拥有的abcde的其他变量在两个
now you know so all of this are other variables we have a b c d e are on two

1194
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:11,120
现在您知道了，所有这些都是我们拥有的abcde的其他变量在两个
variables we have a b c d e are on two variables can be continuous or discrete

1195
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,240
变量可以是连续的也可以是离散的，这并不重要，这里的想法
variables we have a b c d e are on two variables can be continuous or discrete

1196
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,240
变量可以是连续的也可以是离散的，这并不重要，这里的想法
variables can be continuous or discrete doesn't really matter and the idea here

1197
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:16,250
变量可以是连续的也可以是离散的，这并不重要，这里的想法
doesn't really matter and the idea here of the service means that C depends

1198
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,980
的服务意味着C依赖于今天，B依赖于C和D
doesn't really matter and the idea here of the service means that C depends

1199
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,600
的服务意味着C依赖于今天，B依赖于C和D
of the service means that C depends today and B it depends on C and D right

1200
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:21,610
的服务意味着C依赖于今天，B依赖于C和D
today and B it depends on C and D right and so this implies this direction of

1201
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,900
所以这意味着箭头的这个方向是因果关系
today and B it depends on C and D right and so this implies this direction of

1202
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,970
所以这意味着箭头的这个方向是因果关系
and so this implies this direction of the arrow the causal relationship

1203
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:27,980
所以这意味着箭头的这个方向是因果关系
the arrow the causal relationship alright so big doesn't depend on me it

1204
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,600
好吧，这么大不取决于我，取决于D，这是我从中了解到的
the arrow the causal relationship alright so big doesn't depend on me it

1205
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,820
好吧，这么大不取决于我，取决于D，这是我从中了解到的
alright so big doesn't depend on me it depends from D that's what I know from

1206
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:33,830
好吧，这么大不取决于我，取决于D，这是我从中了解到的
depends from D that's what I know from here okay

1207
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,050
好的，剩下的你需要从中得到
depends from D that's what I know from here okay

1208
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:38,610
好的，剩下的你需要从中得到
here okay the rest you will need to derive from

1209
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:38,620
好的，剩下的你需要从中得到
the rest you will need to derive from the factorization employed by this

1210
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,700
该指令模型采用的分解现在是这个方向
the rest you will need to derive from the factorization employed by this

1211
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,890
该指令模型采用的分解现在是这个方向
the factorization employed by this directive model now this one direction

1212
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:44,900
该指令模型采用的分解现在是这个方向
directive model now this one direction graph there is no error okay so

1213
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,860
图没有错误就可以了，所以很明显，如果没有箭头，而您
directive model now this one direction graph there is no error okay so

1214
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,540
图没有错误就可以了，所以很明显，如果没有箭头，而您
graph there is no error okay so obviously if there's no arrows and you

1215
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:49,550
图没有错误就可以了，所以很明显，如果没有箭头，而您
obviously if there's no arrows and you see this connections

1216
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,220
看到此连接显然C与aa和B有关
obviously if there's no arrows and you see this connections

1217
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,440
看到此连接显然C与aa和B有关
see this connections obviously C is related to a a and B

1218
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:53,450
看到此连接显然C与aa和B有关
obviously C is related to a a and B obviously she's related to you

1219
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:56,120
显然，她与您有关，并被羡慕，所以您的招数很严重
obviously C is related to a a and B obviously she's related to you

1220
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,500
显然，她与您有关，并被羡慕，所以您的招数很严重
obviously she's related to you and to be envied so you serious tricks

1221
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:00,510
显然，她与您有关，并被羡慕，所以您的招数很严重
and to be envied so you serious tricks there was this interconnected sets of

1222
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:04,520
有这一系列相互关联的音符，所以两者都暗示着真正的相关性
and to be envied so you serious tricks there was this interconnected sets of

1223
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,180
有这一系列相互关联的音符，所以两者都暗示着真正的相关性
there was this interconnected sets of notes so both imply really correlations

1224
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:08,190

1326
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:47,720
适当的授权，那么您就可以停止谈论推理了
you can stop talking about the inference so for example if you let's say measure

1327
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,640
因此，例如，假设您要测量变量X 1的值，
you can stop talking about the inference so for example if you let's say measure

1328
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,620
因此，例如，假设您要测量变量X 1的值，
so for example if you let's say measure the value of variable X 1 you have you

1329
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:53,630
因此，例如，假设您要测量变量X 1的值，
the value of variable X 1 you have you know what the value is then you can stay

1330
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,720

analyze them ok to get rid of them so obviously you appreciate that the sum

1336
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:08,740
所以很显然，您很欣赏总和和乘积法则对
analyze them ok to get rid of them so obviously you appreciate that the sum

to be the number of edges if we have a directed graph basically would be this

1467
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:59,530
有向图基本上是这对逗号T，否则
to be the number of edges if we have a directed graph basically would be this

1468
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:04,150
有向图基本上是这对逗号T，否则
directed graph basically would be this pair s comma T where the else goes from

1469
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:04,160
有向图基本上是这对逗号T，否则
pair s comma T where the else goes from the you know the arrow goes convexity

1470
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,980
你知道箭头现在变成凸面了，真的，你知道扩展这个
pair s comma T where the else goes from the you know the arrow goes convexity

1471
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:11,980
你知道箭头现在变成凸面了，真的，你知道扩展这个
the you know the arrow goes convexity okay now to really you know extend this

1472
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:11,990
你知道箭头现在变成凸面了，真的，你知道扩展这个
okay now to really you know extend this the bottom directed and directed graphs

1473
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:13,960
底部有向图和有向图必须使用所谓的
okay now to really you know extend this the bottom directed and directed graphs

1474
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,070
底部有向图和有向图必须使用所谓的
the bottom directed and directed graphs you have to use what's called an

1475
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:15,080
底部有向图和有向图必须使用所谓的
you have to use what's called an adjacency matrix so if you define the

1476
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,790
邻接矩阵，所以如果您定义邻接矩阵
you have to use what's called an adjacency matrix so if you define the

1477
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:21,760
邻接矩阵，所以如果您定义邻接矩阵
adjacency matrix so if you define the adjacency matrix

1478
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,000
如果广告的逗号T在此集合中，则GF标普小写注释等于1
adjacency matrix so if you define the adjacency matrix

1479
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,010
如果广告的逗号T在此集合中，则GF标普小写注释等于1


1480
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:32,380
如果广告的逗号T在此集合中，则GF标普小写注释等于1
GF S&amp;P little notes equals one if the ads s comma T is in this set all right

1481
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:32,390
如果广告的逗号T在此集合中，则GF标普小写注释等于1
ads s comma T is in this set all right and this allows you to extend this to

1482
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:35,380
这使您可以将其扩展到无向图，因为如果您有G
ads s comma T is in this set all right and this allows you to extend this to

1483
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:38,500
这使您可以将其扩展到无向图，因为如果您有G
and this allows you to extend this to undirected graphs because if you have G

1484
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:38,510
这使您可以将其扩展到无向图，因为如果您有G
undirected graphs because if you have G of s comma T equal 12 and simultaneous

1485
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:43,150
s的逗号T等于12，同时在T的X的G中等于1，然后
undirected graphs because if you have G of s comma T equal 12 and simultaneous

1486
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,580
s的逗号T等于12，同时在T的X的G中等于1，然后
of s comma T equal 12 and simultaneous in G of T comma X equal to 1 right then

1487
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:45,590
s的逗号T等于12，同时在T的X的G中等于1，然后
in G of T comma X equal to 1 right then this is an undirected graph there is no

1488
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:48,359
这是一个无向图，从s到T没有变化，T 2 s相同
in G of T comma X equal to 1 right then this is an undirected graph there is no

1489
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:51,099
这是一个无向图，从s到T没有变化，T 2 s相同
this is an undirected graph there is no going from s to T and T 2 s is the same

1490
00:51:51,099 --> 00:51:51,109
这是一个无向图，从s到T没有变化，T 2 s相同
going from s to T and T 2 s is the same okay so two examples and I threw a lot

1491
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:56,590
好的，所以有两个例子，到目前为止，我在这里投入了很多术语，
going from s to T and T 2 s is the same okay so two examples and I threw a lot

1492
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:59,230
好的，所以有两个例子，到目前为止，我在这里投入了很多术语，
okay so two examples and I threw a lot so far terminology here that's going to

1493
00:51:59,230 --> 00:51:59,240
好的，所以有两个例子，到目前为止，我在这里投入了很多术语，
so far terminology here that's going to come in the following slides but it

1494
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,030
进入以下幻灯片，但可以多次查看它们，因此您
so far terminology here that's going to come in the following slides but it

1495
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,400
进入以下幻灯片，但可以多次查看它们，因此您
come in the following slides but it helps to see them several times so you

1496
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:03,410
进入以下幻灯片，但可以多次查看它们，因此您
helps to see them several times so you have note one two three four five I am

1497
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:07,570
有注一二三四有五我要打注一路全
helps to see them several times so you have note one two three four five I am

1498
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:10,900
有注一二三四有五我要打注一路全
have note one two three four five I am going to call note one the road all

1499
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:10,910
有注一二三四有五我要打注一路全
going to call note one the road all right can you give me without rocks or

1500
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,720
是的，您能给我没有障碍的东西，甚至只是阅读拉动式滑梯吗？
going to call note one the road all right can you give me without rocks or

1501
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,270
是的，您能给我没有障碍的东西，甚至只是阅读拉动式滑梯吗？
right can you give me without rocks or even reading the pull up slides just

1502
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:16,280
是的，您能给我没有障碍的东西，甚至只是阅读拉动式滑梯吗？
even reading the pull up slides just look on the graph what do you think the

1503
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,150
在图表上看，您认为路线是什么，我的意思不是很好
even reading the pull up slides just look on the graph what do you think the

1504
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:20,800
在图表上看，您认为路线是什么，我的意思不是很好
look on the graph what do you think the route will be I mean wouldn't be a good

1505
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:20,810
在图表上看，您认为路线是什么，我的意思不是很好
route will be I mean wouldn't be a good this mixture

1506
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:21,700
这种混合物，我的意思是你注意到好吗？
route will be I mean wouldn't be a good this mixture

1507
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,390
这种混合物，我的意思是你注意到好吗？
this mixture I mean you notice okay there is from you

1508
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:25,400
这种混合物，我的意思是你注意到好吗？
I mean you notice okay there is from you know so so in other ways why you know

1509
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:33,430
以其他方式知道，为什么你知道这条路线是五条，这就是
I mean you notice okay there is from you know so so in other ways why you know

1510
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:37,420
以其他方式知道，为什么你知道这条路线是五条，这就是
know so so in other ways why you know the route is of five and it's one what

1511
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:37,430
以其他方式知道，为什么你知道这条路线是五条，这就是
the route is of five and it's one what will be a good definition

1512
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:40,090
将是一个很好的定义
the route is of five and it's one what will be a good definition

1513
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:44,579
对，所以在这种情况下，我在这里重复了一个答案
the route is of five and it's one what will be a good definition

1514
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:44,589
对，所以在这种情况下，我在这里重复了一个答案


1515
00:52:44,589 --> 00:52:53,160
对，所以在这种情况下，我在这里重复了一个答案
right so so so I am repeating the answer here in this case one has not lost

1516
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:53,170
对，所以在这种情况下，我在这里重复了一个答案
here in this case one has not lost coming to it okay and as we will see

1517
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,420
可以了，正如我们将看到的，这意味着下面的定义
here in this case one has not lost coming to it okay and as we will see

1518
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,339
可以了，正如我们将看到的，这意味着下面的定义
coming to it okay and as we will see this implies following in definitions

1519
00:52:59,339 --> 00:52:59,349
可以了，正如我们将看到的，这意味着下面的定义
this implies following in definitions when I come up with one has no father

1520
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:01,670
当我想出一个没有父亲好吗
this implies following in definitions when I come up with one has no father

1521
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:02,849
当我想出一个没有父亲好吗
when I come up with one has no father okay

1522
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:02,859
当我想出一个没有父亲好吗
okay and with a definition five them that is

1523
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:06,989
有五个定义，那就是图5的本质。
okay and with a definition five them that is

1524
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:11,689
有五个定义，那就是图5的本质。
and with a definition five them that is the nature of the graph five has no

1525
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:11,699
有五个定义，那就是图5的本质。
the nature of the graph five has no children

1526
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:12,929
孩子们好吗，所以五个并没有简单地发送一个是
the nature of the graph five has no children

1527
00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:19,679
孩子们好吗，所以五个并没有简单地发送一个是
children okay so five has not simply sent one is

1528
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:19,689
孩子们好吗，所以五个并没有简单地发送一个是
okay so five has not simply sent one is the ornament of - all right and three

1529
00:53:19,689 --> 00:53:25,249
装饰物-好吧，三个你知道，这里你知道40多岁-力量是
okay so five has not simply sent one is the ornament of - all right and three

1530
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:28,949
装饰物-好吧，三个你知道，这里你知道40多岁-力量是
the ornament of - all right and three you know here you know 40s - power is

1531
00:53:28,949 --> 00:53:28,959
装饰物-好吧，三个你知道，这里你知道40多岁-力量是
you know here you know 40s - power is two and three

1532
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,670
两个和三个还可以，并实现其他目标
you know here you know 40s - power is two and three

1533
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:34,499
两个和三个还可以，并实现其他目标
two and three okay etc and to achieve what else to

1534
00:53:34,499 --> 00:53:34,509
两个和三个还可以，并实现其他目标
okay etc and to achieve what else to come together is important and it phase

1535
00:53:34,509 --> 00:53:36,499
在一起很重要，它又会再次出现，但是我想
okay etc and to achieve what else to come together is important and it phase

1536
00:53:36,499 --> 00:53:39,599
在一起很重要，它又会再次出现，但是我想
come together is important and it phase again this is coming up later but I want

1537
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:39,609
在一起很重要，它又会再次出现，但是我想
again this is coming up later but I want you to see hundreds of times so we can

1538
00:53:39,609 --> 00:53:41,939
您看到了数百次，因此我们可以进行交流，这说明了
again this is coming up later but I want you to see hundreds of times so we can

1539
00:53:41,939 --> 00:53:47,689
您看到了数百次，因此我们可以进行交流，这说明了
you to see hundreds of times so we can communicate it says this directed a

1540
00:53:47,689 --> 00:53:47,699
您看到了数百次，因此我们可以进行交流，这说明了
communicate it says this directed a means it has no cycles of a cyclic graph

1541
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:52,439
表示它没有循环图的周期
communicate it says this directed a means it has no cycles of a cyclic graph

1542
00:53:52,439 --> 00:53:53,969
表示它没有循环图的周期
means it has no cycles of a cyclic graph all right

1543
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:53,979
表示它没有循环图的周期
all right you noticed has no better it has no

1544
00:53:53,979 --> 00:53:58,130
你注意到没有更好，没有周期有人会说这是周期
all right you noticed has no better it has no

1545
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:01,890
你注意到没有更好，没有周期有人会说这是周期
you noticed has no better it has no cycles someone would say this is a cycle

1546
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:01,900
你注意到没有更好，没有周期有人会说这是周期
cycles someone would say this is a cycle but actually because this is the

1547
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,719
但这实际上是因为这是您在我进去时注意到的电图
cycles someone would say this is a cycle but actually because this is the

1548
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:06,689
但这实际上是因为这是您在我进去时注意到的电图
but actually because this is the electric graph you notice when I go the

1549
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:06,699
但这实际上是因为这是您在我进去时注意到的电图
electric graph you notice when I go the direction of the arrows here I cannot go

1550
00:54:06,699 --> 00:54:09,329
箭头的方向在这里我不能从四个变到三个
electric graph you notice when I go the direction of the arrows here I cannot go

1551
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,229
箭头的方向在这里我不能从四个变到三个
direction of the arrows here I cannot go from four to three

1552
00:54:10,229 --> 00:54:10,239
箭头的方向在这里我不能从四个变到三个
from four to three so there are no cycles them okay

1553
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:14,549
所以没有周期，他们还好吧，所以我们讨论了这个，然后
from four to three so there are no cycles them okay

1554
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:16,859
所以没有周期，他们还好吧，所以我们讨论了这个，然后
so there are no cycles them okay alright so we discussed this and then it

1555
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:16,869
所以没有周期，他们还好吧，所以我们讨论了这个，然后
alright so we discussed this and then it says the notes are number in topological

1556
00:54:16,869 --> 00:54:18,390
说音符是按拓扑顺序编号的，所以这并不意味着看起来非常
alright so we discussed this and then it says the notes are number in topological

1557
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:21,870
说音符是按拓扑顺序编号的，所以这并不意味着看起来非常
says the notes are number in topological order so what does not mean looks very

1558
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:21,880
说音符是按拓扑顺序编号的，所以这并不意味着看起来非常
order so what does not mean looks very sensual for the left graph what do we

1559
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,630
左图是感性的，我们的意思是什么-政治秩序只是看
order so what does not mean looks very sensual for the left graph what do we

1560
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,029
左图是感性的，我们的意思是什么-政治秩序只是看
sensual for the left graph what do we mean - political order just looking at

1561
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:27,039
左图是感性的，我们的意思是什么-政治秩序只是看
mean - political order just looking at this graph basically what will be sort

1562
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:28,829
该图基本上将是您的想象力与我们分享的内容，因此
mean - political order just looking at this graph basically what will be sort

1563
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:34,229
该图基本上将是您的想象力与我们分享的内容，因此
this graph basically what will be sort of your imagination share with us so the

1564
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:34,239
该图基本上将是您的想象力与我们分享的内容，因此
of your imagination share with us so the numbering change in topological order so

1565
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,849
编号按拓扑顺序更改，因此
of your imagination share with us so the numbering change in topological order so

1566
00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:50,930
我的意思是抱怨我总是一二三四五
of your imagination share with us so the numbering change in topological order so

1567
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:50,940
我的意思是抱怨我总是一二三四五


1568
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:57,770
我的意思是抱怨我总是一二三四五
I mean complain I have always one two three four five

1569
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:09,680
好的，传统的听力有点好，因为我们定义了通往
I mean complain I have always one two three four five

1570
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:09,690
好的，传统的听力有点好，因为我们定义了通往


1571
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:15,410
好的，传统的听力有点好，因为我们定义了通往
all right the tradition hearing bit right which since we define the route to

1572
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:15,420
好的，传统的听力有点好，因为我们定义了通往
right which since we define the route to be the note that has no parents all

1573
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,690
是没有父母没事的音符，所以基本上我们必须开始
right which since we define the route to be the note that has no parents all

1574
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:22,370
是没有父母没事的音符，所以基本上我们必须开始
be the note that has no parents all right so basically we have to start

1575
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:22,380
是没有父母没事的音符，所以基本上我们必须开始
right so basically we have to start numbering from the root to the leaves

1576
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,779
从根到叶的编号基本上没问题，这是一种拓扑
right so basically we have to start numbering from the root to the leaves

1577
00:55:26,779 --> 00:55:30,289
从根到叶的编号基本上没问题，这是一种拓扑
numbering from the root to the leaves basically okay and that's a topological

1578
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:30,299
从根到叶的编号基本上没问题，这是一种拓扑
basically okay and that's a topological order not to more complicated God you

1579
00:55:30,299 --> 00:55:34,250
为了不更复杂的上帝，你知道这可能不是唯一的
basically okay and that's a topological order not to more complicated God you

1580
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:36,339
为了不更复杂的上帝，你知道这可能不是唯一的
order not to more complicated God you know this may not be a unique

1581
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:36,349
为了不更复杂的上帝，你知道这可能不是唯一的
know this may not be a unique topological order all right but you

1582
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:41,779
拓扑顺序还可以，但是您雄伟地开始了，您不会
know this may not be a unique topological order all right but you

1583
00:55:41,779 --> 00:55:45,200
拓扑顺序还可以，但是您雄伟地开始了，您不会
topological order all right but you start majestically you are not going to

1584
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:45,210
拓扑顺序还可以，但是您雄伟地开始了，您不会
start majestically you are not going to assign to the chain to the children

1585
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:48,770
分配给孩子链注意，他们按照以下顺序
start majestically you are not going to assign to the chain to the children

1586
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:53,539

正确编号的部分就是给父母和孩子编号
parents and the children that's the idea here

1591
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,150
好吧，所以2＆3是孩子，所以1会
parents and the children that's the idea here

1592
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:05,960
好吧，所以2＆3是孩子，所以1会

1613
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:46,279
所以从某种意义上讲，我声称您在这里看到的驰op非常
so in some sense I'm claiming that the gallop you see here it is very much the

1614
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:46,289
所以从某种意义上讲，我声称您在这里看到的驰op非常
gallop you see here it is very much the same as that job but they see there is

1615
00:56:46,289 --> 00:56:48,500
和那个工作一样，但是他们看到有些事情正在发生
gallop you see here it is very much the same as that job but they see there is

1617
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:50,160
和那个工作一样，但是他们看到有些事情正在发生
something going on that's a little bit different what's the difference between

1618
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,339
不同，当您看着它们时，两个块之间有什么区别
something going on that's a little bit different what's the difference between

00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:53,809
不同，当您看着它们时，两个块之间有什么区别
different what's the difference between the two block when you look at them okay

1620
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:53,819
不同，当您看着它们时，两个块之间有什么区别
the two block when you look at them okay there are no arrows but there is

1621
00:56:53,819 --> 00:56:56,000
没有箭头，但还有其他不同之处，那又是什么
the two block when you look at them okay there are no arrows but there is

1622
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,260
没有箭头，但还有其他不同之处，那又是什么
there are no arrows but there is something else that is different so what

1623
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:00,270
没有箭头，但还有其他不同之处，那又是什么
something else that is different so what is definitely when you visually look at

1624
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:02,660
绝对是当您直观地看到这两个和三个相互连接时
something else that is different so what is definitely when you visually look at

绝对是当您直观地看到这两个和三个相互连接时
this two and three are connected and that's an essential step when you go

1627
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,620
当您从直接草稿中撤出时，这是必不可少的步骤，因此
this two and three are connected and that's an essential step when you go

1628
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:13,430
当您从直接草稿中撤出时，这是必不可少的步骤，因此
and that's an essential step when you go from directly drafts from directed so

1629
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:13,440
当您从直接草稿中撤出时，这是必不可少的步骤，因此
from directly drafts from directed so what are the two and three note what is

1630
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,990
二和三是什么，请注意二和三之间有什么共同点
from directly drafts from directed so what are the two and three note what is

1631
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:21,780
二和三是什么，请注意二和三之间有什么共同点
what are the two and three note what is common between two and three their

1632
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:21,790
二和三是什么，请注意二和三之间有什么共同点
common between two and three their parent just know the

1633
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:29,880
父母只知道
common between two and three their parent just know the

1634
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:30,530
他们的力量点，那么当您从有向图转到UM时
common between two and three their parent just know the

1635
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:30,540
他们的力量点，那么当您从有向图转到UM时


1636
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:37,880
他们的力量点，那么当您从有向图转到UM时
their points of what of power so when you went from a directed graph to UM

1637
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:37,890
他们的力量点，那么当您从有向图转到UM时
you went from a directed graph to UM directive what you need to do is you

1638
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:40,280
指示您需要做的是确保父母已结婚
you went from a directed graph to UM directive what you need to do is you

1639
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,770
指示您需要做的是确保父母已结婚

need to be sure the parents are married because this is not today we don't allow

1641
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:46,330
因为今天不是今天，我们不允许Mary拥有权力，所以我们嫁给所有人
need to be sure the parents are married because this is not today we don't allow

1642
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:51,050
因为今天不是今天，我们不允许Mary拥有权力，所以我们嫁给所有人

1643
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:51,060
因为今天不是今天，我们不允许Mary拥有权力，所以我们嫁给所有人
Mary power okay so we marry them all right and this process methodical is

1644
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,420
正确的，这个过程有条不紊被称为现代化过程
Mary power okay so we marry them all right and this process methodical is

1645
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,900
正确的，这个过程有条不紊被称为现代化过程
right and this process methodical is called a modernization process okay

1646
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:56,910
正确的，这个过程有条不紊被称为现代化过程
called a modernization process okay people who think that I'm you know my

1647
00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:00,200
认为我是您的人知道我让您猜测宗教含义，但是
called a modernization process okay people who think that I'm you know my

1648
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,820
认为我是您的人知道我让您猜测宗教含义，但是
people who think that I'm you know my let you guess religious connotations but

1649
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:01,830
认为我是您的人知道我让您猜测宗教含义，但是
let you guess religious connotations but that's the terminology moralization

1650
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:03,820
那是术语道德化，所以您基本上必须嫁给
let you guess religious connotations but that's the terminology moralization

1651
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,650
那是术语道德化，所以您基本上必须嫁给
that's the terminology moralization okay so you basically have to marry the

1652
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:06,660
那是术语道德化，所以您基本上必须嫁给
okay so you basically have to marry the parents okay

1653
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,730
父母很好，实际上你马上就可以看到
okay so you basically have to marry the parents okay

1654
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:10,010
父母很好，实际上你马上就可以看到
parents okay and actually immediately you can see

1655
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:10,020
父母很好，实际上你马上就可以看到
and actually immediately you can see when you marry the parents you get moved

1656
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,840
当您嫁给父母时，您会在此图中移动
and actually immediately you can see when you marry the parents you get moved

1657
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,340
当您嫁给父母时，您会在此图中移动
when you marry the parents you get moved in this graph

1658
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:13,350
当您嫁给父母时，您会在此图中移动
in this graph okay so suddenly you went from no loops

1659
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:16,430
好吧，突然之间，您从无循环转到了正确且明显的两个循环
in this graph okay so suddenly you went from no loops

1660
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:20,510
好吧，突然之间，您从无循环转到了正确且明显的两个循环
okay so suddenly you went from no loops to two loops right and and obvious

1661
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:20,520
好吧，突然之间，您从无循环转到了正确且明显的两个循环
to two loops right and and obvious implications in the way we're going to

1662
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,520
现在我们将在图中处理这一过程的方式产生影响
to two loops right and and obvious implications in the way we're going to

1663
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:27,020
现在我们将在图中处理这一过程的方式产生影响
implications in the way we're going to treat this process now in the graphs

1664
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:27,030
现在我们将在图中处理这一过程的方式产生影响
treat this process now in the graphs once you moralize you marry the parts

1665
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:29,360
一旦道德化，就将第二部分和第三部分结合在一起，我们就定义了整个整体
treat this process now in the graphs once you moralize you marry the parts

1666
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,940
一旦道德化，就将第二部分和第三部分结合在一起，我们就定义了整个整体
once you moralize you marry the parts two and three we define what this whole

1667
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:31,950
一旦道德化，就将第二部分和第三部分结合在一起，我们就定义了整个整体
two and three we define what this whole page and if particularly of interest

1668
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:34,820
页面，如果特别感兴趣，这里就是所谓的最大集团
two and three we define what this whole page and if particularly of interest

1669
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,140
页面，如果特别感兴趣，这里就是所谓的最大集团
page and if particularly of interest here is what is called maximal cliques

1670
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,150
页面，如果特别感兴趣，这里就是所谓的最大集团
here is what is called maximal cliques okay so click is a set of interconnected

1671
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:44,210
好的，因此单击是一组相互关联的操作不好，例如，如果您是
here is what is called maximal cliques okay so click is a set of interconnected

1672
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:48,880
好的，因此单击是一组相互关联的操作不好，例如，如果您是
okay so click is a set of interconnected no okay so for example if you this is

1673
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:48,890
好的，因此单击是一组相互关联的操作不好，例如，如果您是
no okay so for example if you this is one two or three is a clique right

1674
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:52,550
一二或三是集团权利，因为一个连接到一个平方
no okay so for example if you this is one two or three is a clique right

1675
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:54,530
一二或三是集团权利，因为一个连接到一个平方
one two or three is a clique right because one is connected to one squared

1676
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:54,540
一二或三是集团权利，因为一个连接到一个平方
because one is connected to one squared - 3 + 2 is correct - 3 all the nodes are

1677
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,900
-3 + 2是正确的-3所有节点都已连接，现在您说是1 2 3和

1680
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:07,140
私下为什么没有一名员工没有关联权2 +
connected now you say is 1 2 3 and privately why not

00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:09,760
私下为什么没有一名员工没有关联权2 +
one employee without connected right 2 + 5 3 &amp; 5 are not correct ok so 1 2 &amp; 3 2

1683
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,870
5 3＆5是不正确的，所以他们称我们为1 2＆3 2 3＆4＆3＆5
one employee without connected right 2 + 5 3 &amp; 5 are not correct ok so 1 2 &amp; 3 2

1684

potential would be on automatically and that would be actually an amazing

1704
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,630
这实际上将是一个惊人的定理，我们将要证明
potential would be on automatically and that would be actually an amazing

1705
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,910
这实际上将是一个惊人的定理，我们将要证明
that would be actually an amazing theorem which we are going to prove

1706
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:53,920
这实际上将是一个惊人的定理，我们将要证明
theorem which we are going to prove right but somehow if you have a graph

1707
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,850
是的，但是如果您有这样的图和概率分布，
theorem which we are going to prove right but somehow if you have a graph

1708
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:58,250
是的，但是如果您有这样的图和概率分布，
right but somehow if you have a graph like that and a probability distribution

1709
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:58,260
是的，但是如果您有这样的图和概率分布，
like that and a probability distribution defined on this graph then that you can

1710
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,380
在此图上定义，然后您可以将其分解为
like that and a probability distribution defined on this graph then that you can

1711
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,510
在此图上定义，然后您可以将其分解为
defined on this graph then that you can decompose it on potentials defined over

1712
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:03,520
在此图上定义，然后您可以将其分解为
decompose it on potentials defined over this box conflicts okay

1713
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,220
这个盒子有冲突，好吧，再想一想这是从
decompose it on potentials defined over this box conflicts okay

1714
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:12,000
这个盒子有冲突，好吧，再想一想这是从
this box conflicts okay again think of this as start from the

1715
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:12,010
这个盒子有冲突，好吧，再想一想这是从
again think of this as start from the air ideas because we will discuss those

1716
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:14,700
提出想法，因为我们将在课程学习过程中讨论这些想法，所以
again think of this as start from the air ideas because we will discuss those

1717
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:20,400
提出想法，因为我们将在课程学习过程中讨论这些想法，所以
air ideas because we will discuss those as we go in underneath a course okay so

1718
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:20,410
提出想法，因为我们将在课程学习过程中讨论这些想法，所以
as we go in underneath a course okay so let's see the parents of a node all

1719
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:24,420
让我们看一下节点的父级，您还记得管道定义
as we go in underneath a course okay so let's see the parents of a node all

1720
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:28,620
让我们看一下节点的父级，您还记得管道定义
let's see the parents of a node all right you remember the conduit defining

1721
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:28,630
让我们看一下节点的父级，您还记得管道定义
right you remember the conduit defining what was the name of G this is the

1722
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:30,150
G的名字是什么，这是邻接矩阵，所以节点的父节点
right you remember the conduit defining what was the name of G this is the

1723
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:33,090
G的名字是什么，这是邻接矩阵，所以节点的父节点
what was the name of G this is the adjacency matrix so the parent of a node

1724
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:33,100
G的名字是什么，这是邻接矩阵，所以节点的父节点
adjacency matrix so the parent of a node s are all the node equal G of T comma s

1725
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:36,150
s是T逗号的所有等于G的节点s等于R，因此例如父级
adjacency matrix so the parent of a node s are all the node equal G of T comma s

1726
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:38,550
s是T逗号的所有等于G的节点s等于R，因此例如父级
s are all the node equal G of T comma s is equal to R so for example the parent

1727
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:38,560
s是T逗号的所有等于G的节点s等于R，因此例如父级
is equal to R so for example the parent of non-stick are two and five okay and

1728
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:43,370
不粘的数是2和5可以，您可以将其表示为5等于
is equal to R so for example the parent of non-stick are two and five okay and

1729
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:46,620
不粘的数是2和5可以，您可以将其表示为5等于
of non-stick are two and five okay and you can denote this as five six equal to

1730
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:46,630
不粘的数是2和5可以，您可以将其表示为5等于
you can denote this as five six equal to point 5 or X 5 6 you know different

1731
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:51,300
点5或X 5 6，您知道不同的符号，我认为这是参与的
you can denote this as five six equal to point 5 or X 5 6 you know different

1732
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:54,990
点5或X 5 6，您知道不同的符号，我认为这是参与的
point 5 or X 5 6 you know different notations I think this is participating

1733
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:55,000
点5或X 5 6，您知道不同的符号，我认为这是参与的
notations I think this is participating both notations are the ones used by

1734
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,560
这两种符号都是
notations I think this is participating both notations are the ones used by

1735
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,540
迈克尔·乔丹（Michael Jordan）的东西，两个没有背心的日期基本上都是笔记叶
notations I think this is participating both notations are the ones used by

1736
01:00:59,540 --> 01:00:59,550
迈克尔·乔丹（Michael Jordan）的东西，两个没有背心的日期基本上都是笔记叶


1737
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:10,190
迈克尔·乔丹（Michael Jordan）的东西，两个没有背心的日期基本上都是笔记叶
the Michael Jordan stuff the two dates of no vest are basically the notes leaf

1738
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:10,200
迈克尔·乔丹（Michael Jordan）的东西，两个没有背心的日期基本上都是笔记叶
of no vest are basically the notes leaf touch of Geo Testament equal to one the

1739
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,900
地缘约等于老爬的好是最好的，
of no vest are basically the notes leaf touch of Geo Testament equal to one the

1740
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:18,920
地缘约等于老爬的好是最好的，
touch of Geo Testament equal to one the climbing of an old alright is best and

1741
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:18,930
地缘约等于老爬的好是最好的，
climbing of an old alright is best and the pairing suppressed and so I actually

1742
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:21,500
配对被抑制了，所以我实际上一直在寻找，就像你知道为什么
climbing of an old alright is best and the pairing suppressed and so I actually

1743
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,860
配对被抑制了，所以我实际上一直在寻找，就像你知道为什么
the pairing suppressed and so I actually what I was looking is like you know why

1744
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:24,870
配对被抑制了，所以我实际上一直在寻找，就像你知道为什么
what I was looking is like you know why they don't like the children all right

1745
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:26,900
他们不喜欢孩子们，但是不知为何，所以也许我从不使用
what I was looking is like you know why they don't like the children all right

1746
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,150
他们不喜欢孩子们，但是不知为何，所以也许我从不使用
they don't like the children all right but somehow that's why maybe I never use

1747
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:29,160
他们不喜欢孩子们，但是不知为何，所以也许我从不使用
but somehow that's why maybe I never use the terminology commonly but until we

1748
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:33,230
通常使用该术语，但是直到我们发现这是不正确的
but somehow that's why maybe I never use the terminology commonly but until we

1749
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:34,910
通常使用该术语，但是直到我们发现这是不正确的
the terminology commonly but until we find that this is not right in

1750
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:34,920
通常使用该术语，但是直到我们发现这是不正确的
find that this is not right in definition this is what it is there so

1751
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,130
定义这就是那里的含义，所以家人被问及我们的各个部分
find that this is not right in definition this is what it is there so

1752
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:40,300
定义这就是那里的含义，所以家人被问及我们的各个部分
definition this is what it is there so the family is asked and the parts of us

1753
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:40,310
定义这就是那里的含义，所以家人被问及我们的各个部分
the family is asked and the parts of us we already discussed route least the

1754
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:42,950
我们已经讨论过最少的路线，不认识的父母不离开知识点
the family is asked and the parts of us we already discussed route least the

1755
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:45,260
我们已经讨论过最少的路线，不认识的父母不离开知识点
we already discussed route least the knows no parents to leave the know dot

1756
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:45,270
我们已经讨论过最少的路线，不认识的父母不离开知识点
knows no parents to leave the know dot children the ancestors of an LP are all

1757
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:51,920
孩子LP的祖先都是s的音符，而s的路径是

孩子LP的祖先都是s的音符，而s的路径是
the notes s where there is a path from s to T and equal to directed graph this

1760
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:58,400
到T并等于有向图，如果有的话，该路径必须是有向路径
the notes s where there is a path from s to T and equal to directed graph this

1761
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,790
到T并等于有向图，如果有的话，该路径必须是有向路径
to T and equal to directed graph this path has to be a directed path if some

1762
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:01,800
到T并等于有向图，如果有的话，该路径必须是有向路径
path has to be a directed path if some directed basically any path from s to T

1763
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:06,110
定向从s到T的任何路径都可以做到，
path has to be a directed path if some directed basically any path from s to T

1764
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:08,780
定向从s到T的任何路径都可以做到，
directed basically any path from s to T will do it and the descendants of an

1765
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:08,790
定向从s到T的任何路径都可以做到，
will do it and the descendants of an arrest are all the nodes right but you

1766
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:13,910
逮捕都是正确的节点，但是您可以找到从s到T的路径
will do it and the descendants of an arrest are all the nodes right but you

1767
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:18,080
逮捕都是正确的节点，但是您可以找到从s到T的路径
arrest are all the nodes right but you can find the trail from s to T and again

1768
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:18,090
逮捕都是正确的节点，但是您可以找到从s到T的路径
can find the trail from s to T and again in the ref graphs this trail we have to

1769
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:20,060
在参考图中，我们必须遵循箭头的方向，所以这些是
can find the trail from s to T and again in the ref graphs this trail we have to

1770
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:23,120
在参考图中，我们必须遵循箭头的方向，所以这些是
in the ref graphs this trail we have to follow the arrow so these are the

1771
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:23,130
在参考图中，我们必须遵循箭头的方向，所以这些是
follow the arrow so these are the ancestors and goes to the central the

1772
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:26,690
祖先到中央[掌声]
follow the arrow so these are the ancestors and goes to the central the

01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:29,020
祖先到中央[掌声]
ancestors and goes to the central the [Applause]

1774
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:29,030
祖先到中央[掌声]
[Applause] neighborhoods and it doesn't matter what

1775
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:31,370
街区，无论我要画什么，都可以立即得到
[Applause] neighborhoods and it doesn't matter what

1776
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:34,820
街区，无论我要画什么，都可以立即得到
neighborhoods and it doesn't matter what I will graph we have the immediately

1777
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:34,830
街区，无论我要画什么，都可以立即得到
I will graph we have the immediately corrected note so the neighbors of s all

1778
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:40,190
更正的音符，使s的所有邻居都提供了等于G之一的0％
I will graph we have the immediately corrected note so the neighbors of s all

1779
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:44,780
更正的音符，使s的所有邻居都提供了等于G之一的0％
corrected note so the neighbors of s all the taste provided 0% equal to one of G

1780
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:44,790
更正的音符，使s的所有邻居都提供了等于G之一的0％
the taste provided 0% equal to one of G of T of s equal to one

1781
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:46,880
的T of s等于1可以，因此在定义给定的邻居时
the taste provided 0% equal to one of G of T of s equal to one

1782
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,600
的T of s等于1可以，因此在定义给定的邻居时
of T of s equal to one okay so in defining the neighbors given

1783
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:50,610
的T of s等于1可以，因此在定义给定的邻居时
okay so in defining the neighbors given even if it's a directed graph the

1784
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:52,700
即使它是有向图的方向
okay so in defining the neighbors given even if it's a directed graph the

1785
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,230
即使它是有向图的方向
even if it's a directed graph the orientation

1786
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:54,240
即使它是有向图的方向
orientation it's not important so the degree of a

1787
01:02:54,240 --> 01:03:00,170
这并不重要，所以节点的度数是邻居数
orientation it's not important so the degree of a

1788
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:01,670
这并不重要，所以节点的度数是邻居数
it's not important so the degree of a node is the number of neighbors and in

1789
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:01,680
这并不重要，所以节点的度数是邻居数
node is the number of neighbors and in particular you would see this and lots

1790
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,079
特别是您会看到这一点，并且有很多穆斯林酵素的书在里里外外
node is the number of neighbors and in particular you would see this and lots

1791
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:05,240
特别是您会看到这一点，并且有很多穆斯林酵素的书在里里外外
particular you would see this and lots of Muslim leavening books the in-and-out

1792
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:05,250
特别是您会看到这一点，并且有很多穆斯林酵素的书在里里外外
of Muslim leavening books the in-and-out degrees basically count the number of

1793
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:07,849
学位基本上计算父母的数量和孩子的数量，因此
of Muslim leavening books the in-and-out degrees basically count the number of

1794
01:03:07,849 --> 01:03:10,789
学位基本上计算父母的数量和孩子的数量，因此
degrees basically count the number of parents and the number of children so

1795
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:10,799
学位基本上计算父母的数量和孩子的数量，因此
parents and the number of children so when they say the in degrees the number

1796
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:13,250
当他们说度数为父母数时，他们是度数为父母数
parents and the number of children so when they say the in degrees the number

1797
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:17,299
当他们说度数为父母数时，他们是度数为父母数
when they say the in degrees the number of parents they are degrees the number

1798
01:03:17,299 --> 01:03:17,309
当他们说度数为父母数时，他们是度数为父母数
of parents they are degrees the number of children and this is sort of an

1799
01:03:17,309 --> 01:03:19,789
的孩子，这是一个重要的概念，因为当我们写
of parents they are degrees the number of children and this is sort of an

1800
01:03:19,789 --> 01:03:23,390
的孩子，这是一个重要的概念，因为当我们写
of children and this is sort of an important concept because when we write

1801
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:23,400
的孩子，这是一个重要的概念，因为当我们写
important concept because when we write the joint probability distribution we

1802
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,190
联合概率分布，我们将看到因式分解仍将
important concept because when we write the joint probability distribution we

1803
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:28,279
联合概率分布，我们将看到因式分解仍将
the joint probability distribution we would see the factorization will still

1804
01:03:28,279 --> 01:03:28,289
联合概率分布，我们将看到因式分解仍将
would see the factorization will still basically with this in degrees with a

1805
01:03:28,289 --> 01:03:33,079
基本上，在一定程度上，我保留了许多父母
would see the factorization will still basically with this in degrees with a

1806
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:34,640
基本上，在一定程度上，我保留了许多父母
basically with this in degrees with a number of parents retaining I may

1807
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:34,650
基本上，在一定程度上，我保留了许多父母
number of parents retaining I may actually show you in the slide shortly

1808
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:39,609
实际上在幻灯片中向您展示了，我们已经讨论了
number of parents retaining I may actually show you in the slide shortly

1809
01:03:39,609 --> 01:03:42,200
实际上在幻灯片中向您展示了，我们已经讨论了
actually show you in the slide shortly we already discuss the concept of a

1810
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:42,210
实际上在幻灯片中向您展示了，我们已经讨论了
we already discuss the concept of a directed cycle alright so in this

1811
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:46,339
好吧，定向循环好，所以在此图中没有定向循环
we already discuss the concept of a directed cycle alright so in this

1812
01:03:46,339 --> 01:03:48,920
好吧，定向循环好，所以在此图中没有定向循环
directed cycle alright so in this diagram here there is no directed cycle

1813
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:48,930
好吧，定向循环好，所以在此图中没有定向循环
diagram here there is no directed cycle but you notice from this this one okay

1814
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:51,640
但是您从这一点注意到这一点，这没有一个定向周期
diagram here there is no directed cycle but you notice from this this one okay

1815
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:55,460
但是您从这一点注意到这一点，这没有一个定向周期
but you notice from this this one okay on this there is no directed cycle all

1816
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:55,470
但是您从这一点注意到这一点，这没有一个定向周期
on this there is no directed cycle all right so a directed Pacific Loft is a

1817
01:03:55,470 --> 01:04:00,140
对，所以有向太平洋阁楼是有向环的有向图
on this there is no directed cycle all right so a directed Pacific Loft is a

1818
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,450
对，所以有向太平洋阁楼是有向环的有向图
right so a directed Pacific Loft is a directed graph with non directed cycles

1819
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:02,460
对，所以有向太平洋阁楼是有向环的有向图
directed graph with non directed cycles okay

1820
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,900
好吧，我们将要使用的大多数图形
directed graph with non directed cycles okay

1821
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,790
好吧，我们将要使用的大多数图形
okay and most of the graphs we are going to

1822
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:06,800
好吧，我们将要使用的大多数图形
and most of the graphs we are going to use will be direct the strictly graphs

1823
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,220
使用将是严格的图的直接图，但是您知道我们将其概括时，我们将
and most of the graphs we are going to use will be direct the strictly graphs

1824
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,400
使用将是严格的图的直接图，但是您知道我们将其概括时，我们将
use will be direct the strictly graphs but you know when we generalized we will

01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:12,410
使用将是严格的图的直接图，但是您知道我们将其概括时，我们将
but you know when we generalized we will be able to go away without okay this

1826
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:19,540
能够绕开而走不走这个原则三和直接进入
but you know when we generalized we will be able to go away without okay this

1827
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,850

1828
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:21,860
能够绕开而走不走这个原则三和直接进入
principle the three and the direct entry is very essential because algorithms on

1829
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:24,730
是非常必要的，因为三个算法都可以实现
principle the three and the direct entry is very essential because algorithms on

1830
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:28,030
是非常必要的，因为三个算法都可以实现
is very essential because algorithms on three are they just implement all right

1831
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:28,040
是非常必要的，因为三个算法都可以实现
three are they just implement all right and you know we wish that every graph

1832
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:33,250
而且您知道我们希望每个图都是三个，因为如果是三个，我们
three are they just implement all right and you know we wish that every graph

1833
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:36,610
而且您知道我们希望每个图都是三个，因为如果是三个，我们
and you know we wish that every graph was a three because if it's a three we

1834
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:36,620
而且您知道我们希望每个图都是三个，因为如果是三个，我们
was a three because if it's a three we can do inference in second so this total

1835
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:40,840
可以在第二秒做推断，所以这个总数将是一个理想的情况，因此
was a three because if it's a three we can do inference in second so this total

1836
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:45,360
可以在第二秒做推断，所以这个总数将是一个理想的情况，因此

1837
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:45,370
可以在第二秒做推断，所以这个总数将是一个理想的情况，因此
would be an ideal situation so an undirected three is an undirected graph

1838
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:48,610
无向三是一个无向图，没有循环，并且对于

between any pair of nodes okay and I'm starting with this right because

1844
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:02,320
我从这个权利开始，因为我将能够定义这个

1845
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,330
我从这个权利开始，因为我将能够定义这个
and I'm starting with this right because I would be to be able to define this

1846
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:04,340
我从这个权利开始，因为我将能够定义这个
I would be to be able to define this concept of 23 for directed graphs and

1847
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:07,180
23的概念，用于有向图，并带有内部目录应变
I would be to be able to define this concept of 23 for directed graphs and

23的概念，用于有向图，并带有内部目录应变
with an internal directory strain on directory is an undirected graph with no

1850
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,640
目录是没有循环的无向图，所以例如
with an internal directory strain on directory is an undirected graph with no

1851
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:17,260
目录是没有循环的无向图，所以例如
directory is an undirected graph with no cycles okay so for example did we have

1852
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:17,270
目录是没有循环的无向图，所以例如
cycles okay so for example did we have an undirected three stomach work without

1853
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:24,280
在这里没有周期的无方向的三项胃工作，所以这不好，然后我们
cycles okay so for example did we have an undirected three stomach work without

1854
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,200
在这里没有周期的无方向的三项胃工作，所以这不好，然后我们
an undirected three stomach work without cycles here so this is not good then we

1855
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:26,210
在这里没有周期的无方向的三项胃工作，所以这不好，然后我们
cycles here so this is not good then we have reading picture anyway specimen and

1856
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:28,900
反正有阅读图片的标本，却看不到，也许我们想
cycles here so this is not good then we have reading picture anyway specimen and

1857
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,450
反正有阅读图片的标本，却看不到，也许我们想
have reading picture anyway specimen and don't see it and maybe we'll want to

1858
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:31,460
反正有阅读图片的标本，却看不到，也许我们想
don't see it and maybe we'll want to come alright for our way so you know

1859
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:36,730
顺其自然吧，所以您知道目录没有循环，所以有一个
don't see it and maybe we'll want to come alright for our way so you know

1860
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:39,730
顺其自然吧，所以您知道目录没有循环，所以有一个
come alright for our way so you know directory has no cycles so there is a

1861
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:39,740
顺其自然吧，所以您知道目录没有循环，所以有一个
directory has no cycles so there is a single path from any pair of nodes now a

01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,700
认为有一个抛光，因为它有两个抛光，然后
of Western palate so why the authorities think has one polished because it has

1887
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,440
认为有一个抛光，因为它有两个抛光，然后
think has one polished because it has two polished then what is going to

1888
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:36,450
认为有一个抛光，因为它有两个抛光，然后
two polished then what is going to happen when we transform it to know

1889
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:40,370
当我们将其转换为直接知道图时，我们将与那些结婚
two polished then what is going to happen when we transform it to know

你能告诉我这张图是火车是哪一列，而那棵树是一棵多树还是
can you tell me which one this graphs is a train which to one is a poly-tree or

1915
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:42,060
你能告诉我这张图是火车是哪一列，而那棵树是一棵多树还是
a train which to one is a poly-tree or you know what is this car is this Satori

1916
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:46,660
你知道这辆车是什么Satori他们来对了我们的定义吧
a train which to one is a poly-tree or you know what is this car is this Satori

1917
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:50,920
你知道这辆车是什么Satori他们来对了我们的定义吧
you know what is this car is this Satori they're coming to our definition right

1918
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:50,930
你知道这辆车是什么Satori他们来对了我们的定义吧
they're coming to our definition right over there ft3 is very very noxious of

1919
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:54,290
ft3对大多数飞行员来说非常有害
they're coming to our definition right over there ft3 is very very noxious of

1920
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:56,300
ft3对大多数飞行员来说非常有害
over there ft3 is very very noxious of most one pilot does this loop to be like

1921
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:56,310
ft3对大多数飞行员来说非常有害
most one pilot does this loop to be like a tree right so this actually transform

1922
01:07:56,310 --> 01:08:00,320
就是一棵树，所以它实际上在那里的东部无向图中变形
most one pilot does this loop to be like a tree right so this actually transform

1923
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,210
就是一棵树，所以它实际上在那里的东部无向图中变形
a tree right so this actually transform in eastern undirected graph right there

1924
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:02,220
就是一棵树，所以它实际上在那里的东部无向图中变形
in eastern undirected graph right there will be no novelization of step so the

1925
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:06,890
将不会是步骤的新颖性，因此互连不会在那儿，因为您
in eastern undirected graph right there will be no novelization of step so the

1926
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:09,080
将不会是步骤的新颖性，因此互连不会在那儿，因为您
will be no novelization of step so the interconnect is not in that because you

1927
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:09,090
将不会是步骤的新颖性，因此互连不会在那儿，因为您
interconnect is not in that because you know this just this is the part that has

1928
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:10,670
知道这就是发生过的事情父亲
interconnect is not in that because you know this just this is the part that has

1929
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,380
知道这就是发生过的事情父亲
know this just this is the part that has happened father

1930
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:12,390
知道这就是发生过的事情父亲
happened father so you have every not just one part so

1931
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:15,620
因此，您不仅拥有每个部件，而且拥有一个平台
happened father so you have every not just one part so

1932
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,789
因此，您不仅拥有每个部件，而且拥有一个平台
so you have every not just one part so there would be a single platform

1933
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:16,799
因此，您不仅拥有每个部件，而且拥有一个平台
there would be a single platform everybody know to any other node so this

1934
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:19,370
每个人都对其他任何节点都知道，所以现在这个2 3为什么是33看起来像
there would be a single platform everybody know to any other node so this

1935
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:24,620
每个人都对其他任何节点都知道，所以现在这个2 3为什么是33看起来像
everybody know to any other node so this 2 3 now why is this a 33 it looks like

1936
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:24,630
每个人都对其他任何节点都知道，所以现在这个2 3为什么是33看起来像
2 3 now why is this a 33 it looks like in a simple tree but actually it's a 43

1937
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:27,070
在一个简单的树中，但实际上是43，原因是今晚的
2 3 now why is this a 33 it looks like in a simple tree but actually it's a 43

1938
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:32,599
在一个简单的树中，但实际上是43，原因是今晚的
in a simple tree but actually it's a 43 the reason is what this night has how

1939
01:08:32,599 --> 01:08:32,609
在一个简单的树中，但实际上是43，原因是今晚的
the reason is what this night has how many product is 2 so when you merge them

1940
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,990
许多乘积是2，所以当您合并它们时就可以了
the reason is what this night has how many product is 2 so when you merge them

1941
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:37,490
许多乘积是2，所以当您合并它们时就可以了
many product is 2 so when you merge them all right

1942
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:37,500
许多乘积是2，所以当您合并它们时就可以了
all right and you make this an undirected graph

1943
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,930
而且您将其设为无向图，是的，每条路径都有一条路径
all right and you make this an undirected graph

1944
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:40,640
而且您将其设为无向图，是的，每条路径都有一条路径
and you make this an undirected graph yes there is a single path from every

1945
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:40,650
而且您将其设为无向图，是的，每条路径都有一条路径
yes there is a single path from every node to any other node but there is a

1946
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:42,470
节点到任何其他节点，但有一个循环可以
yes there is a single path from every node to any other node but there is a

1947
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:45,940
节点到任何其他节点，但有一个循环可以
node to any other node but there is a cycle there ok

1948
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:45,950
节点到任何其他节点，但有一个循环可以
cycle there ok now obviously you know the algorithms

1949
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:49,190
现在很明显，您知道当您将算法变得更加复杂时，
cycle there ok now obviously you know the algorithms

1950
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:52,430
现在很明显，您知道当您将算法变得更加复杂时，
now obviously you know the algorithms will get a bit more complicated when you

1951
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:52,440
现在很明显，您知道当您将算法变得更加复杂时，
will get a bit more complicated when you have a poly-tree

1952
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,150
有一个多叉树，但实际上当您将其转换为
will get a bit more complicated when you have a poly-tree

1953
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:57,650
有一个多叉树，但实际上当您将其转换为
have a poly-tree but actually when you transform this to

1954
01:08:57,650 --> 01:08:57,660
有一个多叉树，但实际上当您将其转换为
but actually when you transform this to the third form of graph that I call it

1955
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:00,770
图的第三种形式，我称它为意大利面图，但您会看到
but actually when you transform this to the third form of graph that I call it

1956
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:03,320
图的第三种形式，我称它为意大利面图，但您会看到
the third form of graph that I call it the pasta graph but you will see that

1957
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:03,330
图的第三种形式，我称它为意大利面图，但您会看到
the pasta graph but you will see that you can treat the 23 basically a penny

1958
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:06,110
您可以治疗23基本上一分钱的树会在3时变成实际的
the pasta graph but you will see that you can treat the 23 basically a penny

1959
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:08,420
您可以治疗23基本上一分钱的树会在3时变成实际的
you can treat the 23 basically a penny tree will become actually there at 3

1960
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:08,430
您可以治疗23基本上一分钱的树会在3时变成实际的
tree will become actually there at 3 okay and then you can apply the standard

1961
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:10,910
好的，然后您可以应用标准算法，因此我们已经看到了此费用，
tree will become actually there at 3 okay and then you can apply the standard

1962
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:13,520
好的，然后您可以应用标准算法，因此我们已经看到了此费用，
okay and then you can apply the standard algorithm so we've seen this cost okay

1963
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:13,530
好的，然后您可以应用标准算法，因此我们已经看到了此费用，
algorithm so we've seen this cost okay but you need to change the grade the the

1964
01:09:13,530 --> 01:09:18,050
但您需要更改图表的等级为四边形，所以现在考虑一下
algorithm so we've seen this cost okay but you need to change the grade the the

1965
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:21,200
但您需要更改图表的等级为四边形，所以现在考虑一下
but you need to change the grade the the graph is the quad so now think this

1966
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:21,210
但您需要更改图表的等级为四边形，所以现在考虑一下
graph is the quad so now think this would be a fantastic for graphs look

1967
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:23,660
对于图来说，这将是一个奇妙的效果，这也将是非常奇妙的，因此
graph is the quad so now think this would be a fantastic for graphs look

1968
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:27,770
对于图来说，这将是一个奇妙的效果，这也将是非常奇妙的，因此
would be a fantastic for graphs look like that this will also be fantastic so

1969
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:27,780
对于图来说，这将是一个奇妙的效果，这也将是非常奇妙的，因此
like that this will also be fantastic so it is more complicated but somehow we

1970
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:30,170
它更复杂，但是以某种方式我们将能够让您知道开发
like that this will also be fantastic so it is more complicated but somehow we

1971
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:35,090
它更复杂，但是以某种方式我们将能够让您知道开发
it is more complicated but somehow we will be able to do you know develop

1972
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:35,100
它更复杂，但是以某种方式我们将能够让您知道开发
will be able to do you know develop algorithms that they have the same

1973
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,530
它们具有相同复杂度的算法
will be able to do you know develop algorithms that they have the same

1974
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:39,149
它们具有相同复杂度的算法
algorithms that they have the same complex this it will work

1975
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:39,159
它们具有相同复杂度的算法
complex this it will work okay so this is basically the same thing

1976
01:09:39,159 --> 01:09:41,649
好吧，这基本上就是我们刚刚讨论的同一件事，也是同一件事
complex this it will work okay so this is basically the same thing

1977
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:45,789
好吧，这基本上就是我们刚刚讨论的同一件事，也是同一件事
okay so this is basically the same thing we just discussed and the same thing

1978
01:09:45,789 --> 01:09:45,799
好吧，这基本上就是我们刚刚讨论的同一件事，也是同一件事
we just discussed and the same thing here so we talked about cliques and

1979
01:09:45,799 --> 01:09:48,970
在这里，我们讨论了集团和最大集团，所以这是
we just discussed and the same thing here so we talked about cliques and

1980
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:52,209
在这里，我们讨论了集团和最大集团，所以这是
here so we talked about cliques and maximal cliques so there is this

1981
01:09:52,209 --> 01:09:52,219
在这里，我们讨论了集团和最大集团，所以这是
maximal cliques so there is this constant of a clique is only defined for

1982
01:09:52,219 --> 01:09:53,979
集团的常数仅针对无向图进行定义，再次为更多
maximal cliques so there is this constant of a clique is only defined for

1983
01:09:53,979 --> 01:09:58,750
集团的常数仅针对无向图进行定义，再次为更多
constant of a clique is only defined for undirected graphs and again a much more

1984
01:09:58,750 --> 01:09:58,760
集团的常数仅针对无向图进行定义，再次为更多
undirected graphs and again a much more clique is the the highest number of

1985
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:03,340
派系是互连节点数最多，数目最多的节点
undirected graphs and again a much more clique is the the highest number of

1986
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,919
派系是互连节点数最多，数目最多的节点
clique is the the highest number of interconnected nodes and highest number

1987
01:10:05,919 --> 01:10:05,929
派系是互连节点数最多，数目最多的节点
interconnected nodes and highest number means you cannot go and consider adding

1988
01:10:05,929 --> 01:10:07,930
意味着您不能去考虑在集团中再加上一个否定
interconnected nodes and highest number means you cannot go and consider adding

1989
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:10,510
意味着您不能去考虑在集团中再加上一个否定
means you cannot go and consider adding another no to the clique without

1990
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:10,520
意味着您不能去考虑在集团中再加上一个否定
another no to the clique without violating the property okay so this

1991
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,870
侵犯财产好吧，这将是必不可少的发展先生
another no to the clique without violating the property okay so this

1992
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:18,640
侵犯财产好吧，这将是必不可少的发展先生
violating the property okay so this would be an essential development sir

1993
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:18,650
侵犯财产好吧，这将是必不可少的发展先生
would be an essential development sir charies a directed graph when you

1994
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:22,240
当您动员它使它成为无向的时，将有理图
would be an essential development sir charies a directed graph when you

1995
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,580
当您动员它使它成为无向的时，将有理图
charies a directed graph when you mobilize this to make it an undirected

1996
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:24,590
当您动员它使它成为无向的时，将有理图
mobilize this to make it an undirected graph that looks like up okay so what

1997
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:29,939
看起来不错的图，如果我在这里结婚2和3会怎样？
mobilize this to make it an undirected graph that looks like up okay so what

1998
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:34,450
看起来不错的图，如果我在这里结婚2和3会怎样？
graph that looks like up okay so what what parents if I married here 2 &amp; 3

1999
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:34,460
看起来不错的图，如果我在这里结婚2和3会怎样？
what parents if I married here 2 &amp; 3 right 5 this pillow and that C 7 has how

2000
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:38,229
对5这个枕头，C 7有多少父母拥有3票对
what parents if I married here 2 &amp; 3 right 5 this pillow and that C 7 has how

01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:44,420
对5这个枕头，C 7有多少父母拥有3票对
many parents has 3 votes right how's the post will have three parts well there's

2003
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:47,470
帖子将分为三个部分，可以允许一些宗教，所以我们
many parents has 3 votes right how's the post will have three parts well there's

alright and again you know I'm trying this just to treat from now but yeah

2009
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:06,399
这只是从现在开始要治疗的，但是是的，我们将详细讨论这一点。
alright and again you know I'm trying this just to treat from now but yeah

2011
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:08,000
这只是从现在开始要治疗的，但是是的，我们将详细讨论这一点。
we're going to discuss this in details right so you know just remember what

2012
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,330
是的，所以您只需要记住这个组织过程意味着什么，
we're going to discuss this in details right so you know just remember what

2013
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:12,129
是的，所以您只需要记住这个组织过程意味着什么，
right so you know just remember what this process of organization means and

2014
01:11:12,129 --> 01:11:12,139
是的，所以您只需要记住这个组织过程意味着什么，
this process of organization means and somehow we haven't proved the district

2015
01:11:12,139 --> 01:11:14,649
不知何故我们还没有证明我们将进入这个地区，无论您知道什么
this process of organization means and somehow we haven't proved the district

2016
01:11:14,649 --> 01:11:16,810
不知何故我们还没有证明我们将进入这个地区，无论您知道什么
somehow we haven't proved the district we will into this and whatever you know

2017
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:16,820
不知何故我们还没有证明我们将进入这个地区，无论您知道什么
we will into this and whatever you know how many I said well equivalent means

2018
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:18,609
我说了多少对等的意思是对的，所以当我们讨论时，我们会看到
we will into this and whatever you know how many I said well equivalent means

2019
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:22,419
我说了多少对等的意思是对的，所以当我们讨论时，我们会看到
how many I said well equivalent means right so we will see when we discussed

2020
01:11:22,419 --> 01:11:22,429
我说了多少对等的意思是对的，所以当我们讨论时，我们会看到
right so we will see when we discussed about optimization of the joint

2021
01:11:22,429 --> 01:11:26,320
关于联合概率分布的优化
right so we will see when we discussed about optimization of the joint

probability distribution - gross alright so highways the goal

2024
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:32,840
-好吧，好吧，高速公路就是正确的目标，让我毫无保留地给你
probability distribution - gross alright so highways the goal

2025
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:37,070
-好吧，好吧，高速公路就是正确的目标，让我毫无保留地给你
- gross alright so highways the goal right so let me give you without any

2026
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:37,080
-好吧，好吧，高速公路就是正确的目标，让我毫无保留地给你
right so let me give you without any prints or anything like that okay

2027
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,600
打印或类似的东西好吧，因为我们会回到这个
right so let me give you without any prints or anything like that okay

2028
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,700
打印或类似的东西好吧，因为我们会回到这个
prints or anything like that okay because we will come back to this I

2029
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:40,710
打印或类似的东西好吧，因为我们会回到这个
because we will come back to this I would join probably distribution of this

2030
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:43,280
将加入这七个变量的分布，因为它们基于
because we will come back to this I would join probably distribution of this

2031
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,790
将加入这七个变量的分布，因为它们基于
would join probably distribution of this seven variables is they compose based on

2032
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:46,800
将加入这七个变量的分布，因为它们基于
seven variables is they compose based on the graph that you see okay so the

2033
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,250
您看到的图表还可以，因此下一个1到7的符号表示这是
seven variables is they compose based on the graph that you see okay so the

2034
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:52,070
您看到的图表还可以，因此下一个1到7的符号表示这是
the graph that you see okay so the notation next one to seven means this is

2035
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:52,080
您看到的图表还可以，因此下一个1到7的符号表示这是
notation next one to seven means this is the joint probability electronic Stewart

2036
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,310
联合概率电子斯图尔特七号，现在，如果我们有右图

01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:00,570
联合概率电子斯图尔特七号，现在，如果我们有右图
seven and now if we have a graph right and somebody gives you the the you know

2039
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:04,550
有人给你，你知道P效应要在七个理论上
seven and now if we have a graph right and somebody gives you the the you know

tells you what's the what is going to be the right hand side

2044
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:11,730
告诉你什么是右手边
the right hand side I mean without looking at this right so

2045
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:14,690
我的意思是不看这个权利就不要看这个
the right hand side I mean without looking at this right so

2046
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:16,010
我的意思是不看这个权利就不要看这个
I mean without looking at this right so you don't look at this what is to

2047
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:16,020
我的意思是不看这个权利就不要看这个
you don't look at this what is to improve ability relates to join of

2048
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,200
一键提高与两个效果变量的连接有关的能力
you don't look at this what is to improve ability relates to join of

2049
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,780
一键提高与两个效果变量的连接有关的能力
improve ability relates to join of variables of the two effects one touch

2050
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:20,790
一键提高与两个效果变量的连接有关的能力
variables of the two effects one touch seven varieties will be north x one

2051
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:24,800
七个品种将成为北方x效果甚至是值得的一倍
variables of the two effects one touch seven varieties will be north x one

2052
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,470
七个品种将成为北方x效果甚至是值得的一倍
seven varieties will be north x one times what the effect is even worth

2053
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:29,480
七个品种将成为北方x效果甚至是值得的一倍
times what the effect is even worth after and and p53 given x1 x2 etc now if

2054
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:35,180
之后和和p53给定x1 x2等，如果您注意到一般要求的话，那就是
times what the effect is even worth after and and p53 given x1 x2 etc now if

2055
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:37,190
之后和和p53给定x1 x2等，如果您注意到一般要求的话，那就是
after and and p53 given x1 x2 etc now if you notice general claiming well it's

2056
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:37,200
之后和和p53给定x1 x2等，如果您注意到一般要求的话，那就是
