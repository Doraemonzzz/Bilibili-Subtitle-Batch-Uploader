1
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,740
all right before we start I have a question I know the homework is good

2
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,900
question I know the homework is good tomorrow

3
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:48,510
tomorrow are you working late with the situation

4
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:48,520


5
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:55,300
Nick you have the barometer of the class because you always do things the last

6
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:03,420
because you always do things the last minute so somewhere okay on schedule

7
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:03,430


8
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:10,590
Yass would be there's a lot of uncertainty there so what is what's the

9
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,080
uncertainty there so what is what's the idea here

10
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,090


11
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,020
all right I get no response you know what no response means the homework is

12
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,970
what no response means the homework is here tomorrow and there will be a new

13
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:28,350
here tomorrow and there will be a new homework on Thursday so what we need to

14
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,880
homework on Thursday so what we need to do is you know we're covering top of

15
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,570
do is you know we're covering top of general algorithms for inference and in

16
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,160
general algorithms for inference and in particularly we were talking about the

17
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,670
particularly we were talking about the sample of the algorithm in twist which

18
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,070
sample of the algorithm in twist which is applicable both for direct indirect

19
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,040
is applicable both for direct indirect interest and so we've summarized this

20
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,960
interest and so we've summarized this today give you the algorithm hopefully

21
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,270
today give you the algorithm hopefully there will be a programming homework on

22
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,580
there will be a programming homework on this topic there for next week and also

23
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,840
this topic there for next week and also will generalize this with poly trace by

24
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,890
will generalize this with poly trace by introducing what is called factor trees

25
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,460
introducing what is called factor trees okay and I think depending how far we go

26
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,860
okay and I think depending how far we go today on Thursday we're going to start

27
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,590
today on Thursday we're going to start talking about the junction tree

28
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,650
talking about the junction tree algorithm which is even more general and

29
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,880
algorithm which is even more general and then after that actually we're going to

30
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,170
then after that actually we're going to start doing a lots of application

31
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,600
start doing a lots of application examples so some of the things that we

32
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,910
examples so some of the things that we have seen briefly we will see them again

33
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,150
have seen briefly we will see them again in detail including hidden Markov model

34
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,870
in detail including hidden Markov model space state-space models etc but it's

35
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,520
space state-space models etc but it's better to see the general theory and

36
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,979
better to see the general theory and then go to specifics around the other

37
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:44,699
then go to specifics around the other way around

38
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:47,370
way around eventually we run out of time there is

39
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,559
eventually we run out of time there is no room for the ok

40
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:59,190
no room for the ok so we were looking at this writin and we

41
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,240
so we were looking at this writin and we discuss if you have a directed graph you

42
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,970
discuss if you have a directed graph you transform it to an undirected graph and

43
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,520
transform it to an undirected graph and so we discuss about the sample the

44
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,500
so we discuss about the sample the algorithm for at three okay then it is

45
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,849
algorithm for at three okay then it is what you see on the first box alright so

46
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:19,849
what you see on the first box alright so if you have to introduce the evidence

47
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:22,890
if you have to introduce the evidence and the way he do this is by modifying

48
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:29,370
and the way he do this is by modifying the known potential all right so if X is

49
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,730
the known potential all right so if X is fixed somewhere and you already have a

50
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,029
fixed somewhere and you already have a potential of syusai you multiply by

51
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:37,980
potential of syusai you multiply by Delta function to force excited to take

52
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,400
Delta function to force excited to take this value at sidebar in many ways if

53
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,779
this value at sidebar in many ways if you don't have these cell potentials

54
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:47,159
you don't have these cell potentials this is been useful to impose everything

55
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,589
this is been useful to impose everything specifically in your in your ground all

56
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,200
specifically in your in your ground all right you have to choose a route in the

57
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,960
right you have to choose a route in the graph and in some sense for now you can

58
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,520
graph and in some sense for now you can take anything you want to because this

59
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,659
take anything you want to because this is a tree so any node you choose root

60
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:03,930
is a tree so any node you choose root and the algorithm starts with very

61
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,860
and the algorithm starts with very simple steps that requires total precut

62
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,860
simple steps that requires total precut C programming okay so if you start with

63
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,890
C programming okay so if you start with a node in the neighborhood of the of the

64
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,000
a node in the neighborhood of the of the root and you call this command collect

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,890
root and you call this command collect that's Hawaii okay so the collect

66
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,960
that's Hawaii okay so the collect algorithm you see basically here right

67
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,629
algorithm you see basically here right so you know give message this if you

68
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:32,969
so you know give message this if you know the message from k2j from this node

69
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:35,310
know the message from k2j from this node today then effectively you are ready to

70
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,909
today then effectively you are ready to propagate presence is to know the I and

71
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:40,320
propagate presence is to know the I and these messages are given by this command

72
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,700
these messages are given by this command that is 2 here we multiply the potential

73
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,060
that is 2 here we multiply the potential of I and J which are potential in all J

74
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,430
of I and J which are potential in all J and all the incoming messages that there

75
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,350
and all the incoming messages that there are functions of X J and then you

76
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,110
are functions of X J and then you marginalized X J so the passing message

77
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,330
marginalized X J so the passing message it's a message that depends strongly on

78
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:03,500
it's a message that depends strongly on Exile okay so in the Colet space

79
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,480
Exile okay so in the Colet space basically if you need to be able to

80
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,659
basically if you need to be able to start propagating this message from

81
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:13,980
start propagating this message from let's say if this is a road all right to

82
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,680
let's say if this is a road all right to be able to compute this messages you

83
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,270
be able to compute this messages you need to compute the messages coming from

84
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,610
need to compute the messages coming from that syndrome and then to compute those

85
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,860
that syndrome and then to compute those mess you have to keep going down

86
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,939
mess you have to keep going down eventually this will take me down to the

87
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:27,420
eventually this will take me down to the leaves and that's why the collect

88
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,560
leaves and that's why the collect algorithm you noticed

89
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,409
algorithm you noticed it's the recursive algorithm so you

90
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:34,080
it's the recursive algorithm so you start from the root and then you go one

91
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,770
start from the root and then you go one step down at a time until basically you

92
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,390
step down at a time until basically you are at the bottom and you can already

93
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,340
are at the bottom and you can already start collecting messages okay so you

94
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,719
start collecting messages okay so you don't have to write any fantastic

95
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,969
don't have to write any fantastic algorithm this is a canal but it's

96
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:51,900
algorithm this is a canal but it's basically for you know connecting the

97
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,650
basically for you know connecting the messages to be able to send a message

98
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,140
messages to be able to send a message from Ted why you need to have all the

99
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,260
from Ted why you need to have all the incoming vessels arriving in our journey

100
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,409
incoming vessels arriving in our journey okay

101
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:05,940
okay so so this is the collect and similarly

102
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,810
so so this is the collect and similarly the distributed messaging algorithm you

103
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,300
the distributed messaging algorithm you can see here it meets all the messages

104
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,629
can see here it meets all the messages arrive at the route then you are ready

105
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:17,520
arrive at the route then you are ready to start sending messages from the route

106
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,550
to start sending messages from the route down to the stillness of the route all

107
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,089
down to the stillness of the route all the way down to the leaves so if you you

108
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:27,480
the way down to the leaves so if you you can send this message and then the

109
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,040
can send this message and then the distribute algorithm is basically

110
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,330
distribute algorithm is basically propagated and again the propagating of

111
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,560
propagated and again the propagating of messages follows exactly the same

112
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,290
messages follows exactly the same commands that you know messages go up or

113
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,760
commands that you know messages go up or down specially the same commanders

114
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,550
down specially the same commanders disappear okay so the only thing have to

115
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,350
disappear okay so the only thing have to keep in mind when you propagate message

116
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,200
keep in mind when you propagate message from J to I and your countlessly for the

117
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,450
from J to I and your countlessly for the incoming messages to say if you don't

118
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:52,800
incoming messages to say if you don't account for the best is coming from I so

119
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,510
account for the best is coming from I so they're not gonna send try the Masters I

120
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,960
they're not gonna send try the Masters I sent you okay this is from the mental to

121
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,040
sent you okay this is from the mental to this

122
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:05,240
this masters parsing algorithms so eventually

123
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,820
masters parsing algorithms so eventually the collect step basically you go all

124
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,980
the collect step basically you go all the way down until you start sending

125
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,960
the way down until you start sending messages to the root and then from the

126
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,430
messages to the root and then from the root you all the way down to the leaf

127
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,369
root you all the way down to the leaf sending messages showing every edge at

128
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:18,480
sending messages showing every edge at the end of the day you're going to have

129
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,589
the end of the day you're going to have messages in both directions okay and we

130
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:26,100
messages in both directions okay and we already have Punta based for threads if

131
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,689
already have Punta based for threads if you want if you have this race engine

132
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:29,460
you want if you have this race engine you want to try to compute the marginal

133
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,490
you want to try to compute the marginal of a given no the only thing you have to

134
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,800
of a given no the only thing you have to do is multiply all the messages

135
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,469
do is multiply all the messages surviving to that note times the

136
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:44,579
surviving to that note times the potential but not the normalized okay so

137
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:47,160
potential but not the normalized okay so and we already discuss a few ones that

138
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,990
and we already discuss a few ones that say the Joint Distribution of I and J

139
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,600
say the Joint Distribution of I and J you know you can sort of write a single

140
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,150
you know you can sort of write a single algorithm with what we derive for change

141
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:06,030
algorithm with what we derive for change okay so again you choose any route you

142
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,699
okay so again you choose any route you send messages from the names to the

143
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:12,240
send messages from the names to the route and then from the road down to the

144
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,930
route and then from the road down to the links and and and then that's it

145
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:18,940


146
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,910
I mentioned that so this algorithm is basically portrays if you try to

147
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,820
basically portrays if you try to generalize this in principle it may work

148
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,610
generalize this in principle it may work right so even if you don't have a tree

149
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,580
right so even if you don't have a tree and you try to use the same idea you

150
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,700
and you try to use the same idea you call something the root and you start

151
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,000
call something the root and you start sending messages you know you hold it

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,650
sending messages you know you hold it over one point you said I stay with you

153
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,140
over one point you said I stay with you and you send messages from the list all

154
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,720
and you send messages from the list all the way up and the other way around this

155
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,600
the way up and the other way around this may work even if you have loose okay but

156
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,130
may work even if you have loose okay but I'm not the antis that actually will

157
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,610
I'm not the antis that actually will work okay and the reflections of the

158
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,290
work okay and the reflections of the sound worried from including what is

159
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,830
sound worried from including what is called loopy belief propagation that

160
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,990
called loopy belief propagation that basically at the end of the day do the

161
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,410
basically at the end of the day do the same message passing in some systematic

162
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,440
same message passing in some systematic manner and then because they saw what if

163
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,810
manner and then because they saw what if they keep going forever you just stop it

164
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,430
they keep going forever you just stop it at a certain time when the messages

165
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,650
at a certain time when the messages don't change very much and you call that

166
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,760
don't change very much and you call that the end of the story hoping for the best

167
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,650
the end of the story hoping for the best okay

168
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:23,210
okay many years ago I you know when we were

169
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:27,210
many years ago I you know when we were writing a proposal somehow I I got

170
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,010
writing a proposal somehow I I got excited about this concept of loopy

171
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,160
excited about this concept of loopy belief propagation and I told all this

172
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,900
belief propagation and I told all this mathematician so you know we have to use

173
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,480
mathematician so you know we have to use this loopy belief algorithm and

174
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,920
this loopy belief algorithm and everybody had no idea what I was talking

175
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,880
everybody had no idea what I was talking because looping means crazy okay

176
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,180
because looping means crazy okay but obviously here is not a disgrace it

177
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,120
but obviously here is not a disgrace it means there are loops okay but it's all

178
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,770
means there are loops okay but it's all relative

179
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,510
relative they always may go crazy if you have

180
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,780
they always may go crazy if you have loops all right so one way you sit on

181
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,679
loops all right so one way you sit on the other you get the same message

182
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:07,900
the other you get the same message so if you have a directed graph what you

183
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,139
so if you have a directed graph what you have even though it is a tree like when

184
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,519
have even though it is a tree like when you transform into an undirected graph

185
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,889
you transform into an undirected graph you have to marry the parent so if you

186
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:17,199
you have to marry the parent so if you have two parents basically them directly

187
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:22,179
have two parents basically them directly God is going to have loops okay so one

188
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:25,299
God is going to have loops okay so one easy way to get away from this problem

189
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:27,160
easy way to get away from this problem without using this concept of look at

190
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,590
without using this concept of look at the new propagation is to transform this

191
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,859
the new propagation is to transform this graph to what is called a factor graph

192
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:35,199
graph to what is called a factor graph okay an instan idea basically that

193
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:38,639
okay an instan idea basically that everybody is using its simple trial

194
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,519
everybody is using its simple trial equal crap you know that allows you to

195
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,470
equal crap you know that allows you to extend the the sum product algorithm to

196
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,009
extend the the sum product algorithm to poly triste

197
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:50,079
poly triste so one where this I'm gonna reveal this

198
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,569
so one where this I'm gonna reveal this and tell you how this algorithm is going

199
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:55,629
and tell you how this algorithm is going to work for this factor graphs so we

200
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:57,220
to work for this factor graphs so we have to spend maybe ten fifteen minutes

201
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,090
have to spend maybe ten fifteen minutes to discuss what's a pack together so in

202
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,400
to discuss what's a pack together so in the photograph in addition to the nodes

203
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,639
the photograph in addition to the nodes that denote for all the variables like X

204
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,869
that denote for all the variables like X 1 X 2 X 3

205
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:11,679
1 X 2 X 3 you also have squared nodes that denote

206
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,970
you also have squared nodes that denote function the pencils so basically the

207
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,179
function the pencils so basically the fact that this total curve and express

208
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:22,059
fact that this total curve and express the graph that explicitly shows you the

209
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:25,539
the graph that explicitly shows you the potentials that are used in the

210
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:27,400
potentials that are used in the factorization of the joint probability

211
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,549
factorization of the joint probability distribution so for example let's look

212
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,909
distribution so for example let's look at this undirected graph right so I have

213
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:36,309
at this undirected graph right so I have P of X 1 P of X tilde has no farlands

214
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:39,879
P of X 1 P of X tilde has no farlands times P of X 3 given X 1 and X 2 so the

215
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:42,970
times P of X 3 given X 1 and X 2 so the factor graph looks like what you see

216
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,129
factor graph looks like what you see here okay this is a faction which is P

217
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:50,919
here okay this is a faction which is P of X 1 this function which is perfect to

218
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:55,600
of X 1 this function which is perfect to you notice this function are connected

219
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,729
you notice this function are connected to the nodes

220
00:12:57,729 --> 00:12:59,619
to the nodes indicating which arguments are inside

221
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:01,989
indicating which arguments are inside those functions so feel touch one it's

222
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,449
those functions so feel touch one it's only involves sexual so it's only four

223
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:04,910
only involves sexual so it's only four left

224
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,549
left Schwann he of x2 is only connected to X

225
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:10,579
Schwann he of x2 is only connected to X 2 and then we have this function of P of

226
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:12,829
2 and then we have this function of P of X 3 given X 1 institution as a function

227
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:14,929
X 3 given X 1 institution as a function of three arguments so this is connected

228
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:23,569
of three arguments so this is connected to the 3 body okay so this the variables

229
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,970
to the 3 body okay so this the variables the random variables this charge these

230
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:31,159
the random variables this charge these factors and two nodes in the context of

231
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,109
factors and two nodes in the context of what we define a neighborhood in

232
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:35,960
what we define a neighborhood in directional directly up to now share

233
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,530
directional directly up to now share neighbors if they're basically sharing a

234
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,710
neighbors if they're basically sharing a factor not depend parts of the same

235
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,379
factor not depend parts of the same function be special for example x1 x2

236
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:47,989
function be special for example x1 x2 our know our neighbors because they are

237
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:51,710
our know our neighbors because they are part of this fact to know that connects

238
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:59,689
part of this fact to know that connects x1 x2 and x3 two more examples so you

239
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:02,599
x1 x2 and x3 two more examples so you know this list for the problem that you

240
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:05,629
know this list for the problem that you just discussed right I want to shake on

241
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:10,340
just discussed right I want to shake on this on this slide that the design of

242
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,619
this on this slide that the design of the factor graph from a given Direction

243
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:15,769
the factor graph from a given Direction graph is not a unique contract so you

244
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,119
graph is not a unique contract so you can have actually multiple paths to

245
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:22,039
can have actually multiple paths to graph ok and nothing really to worry at

246
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,389
graph ok and nothing really to worry at least in the context of this class so

247
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:25,900
least in the context of this class so for example here remember we have the

248
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,059
for example here remember we have the effect of friction aspectual on a factor

249
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:31,249
effect of friction aspectual on a factor for its to write and the part of that

250
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:33,319
for its to write and the part of that involves the three arguments here you

251
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:35,479
involves the three arguments here you know what I do is I only use one factor

252
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,919
know what I do is I only use one factor because this factor involves the three

253
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,439
because this factor involves the three arguments I could pose to be

254
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,659
arguments I could pose to be affectionate P of x2 as part of the

255
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:43,249
affectionate P of x2 as part of the biggest part of involves from three

256
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,539
biggest part of involves from three together alright so this is one course

257
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:51,470
together alright so this is one course but this is what we saw before right the

258
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:57,229
but this is what we saw before right the same so this two are different okay in

259
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,710
same so this two are different okay in this case I suppose the cost of doing

260
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,029
this case I suppose the cost of doing inference of something like this or

261
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:04,489
inference of something like this or something like that it's practically the

262
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:07,039
something like that it's practically the same because you notice here you know

263
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,449
same because you notice here you know you have three variables and here you

264
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,210
you have three variables and here you have three variables so we'll so that is

265
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,710
have three variables so we'll so that is what defines the complexity of the

266
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,400
what defines the complexity of the problem

267
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,620
problem but it's somehow you can write this

268
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,960
but it's somehow you can write this without those that have only to take two

269
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,300
without those that have only to take two arguments that would be the best way but

270
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,290
arguments that would be the best way but you cannot do it here because one of the

271
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,300
you cannot do it here because one of the probabilities is your X 3 given X 1 and

272
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,080
probabilities is your X 3 given X 1 and X 2 so you need a factor of also 3

273
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:36,480
X 2 so you need a factor of also 3 arguments again variable nodes these are

274
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,390
arguments again variable nodes these are factor notes their functions all right

275
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:45,860
factor notes their functions all right [Applause]

276
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:45,870


277
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:52,490
so for example in in this case right so let's look so before we had the directly

278
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,350
let's look so before we had the directly graph here we have an undirected graph

279
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,560
graph here we have an undirected graph so we have a clique that involves nodes

280
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,250
so we have a clique that involves nodes 1 &amp; 2 so there is a potential of X 1 and

281
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,070
1 &amp; 2 so there is a potential of X 1 and X 2 and then we have a clique involves 2

282
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,220
X 2 and then we have a clique involves 2 3 &amp; 4 so vivid potential of 3 variables

283
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,040
3 &amp; 4 so vivid potential of 3 variables so the part of graph is very simple

284
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,360
so the part of graph is very simple there is a factor of they are the

285
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,490
there is a factor of they are the connect X 1 X 2 that's explicitly this

286
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,420
connect X 1 X 2 that's explicitly this function and then there is another

287
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:24,920
function and then there is another particles of connect 2 3 &amp; 4

288
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:24,930


289
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:30,470
right and as I said several photographs would correspond to the same undirected

290
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,130
would correspond to the same undirected graph so in this case you know there is

291
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,070
graph so in this case you know there is only one click so you can collect all X

292
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,890
only one click so you can collect all X 1 X 2 X 3 to the others in one factor

293
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,829
1 X 2 X 3 to the others in one factor but here you know actually you can do

294
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:45,440
but here you know actually you can do weird things and split it in the factor

295
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,900
weird things and split it in the factor of 3 and also factors to so of course

296
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,130
of 3 and also factors to so of course you're not going to gain anything with

297
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,880
you're not going to gain anything with us but that's another story

298
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,560
us but that's another story so at this time directed graph right and

299
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,510
so at this time directed graph right and look a pissed-off the graph and this

300
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,850
look a pissed-off the graph and this factor block and don't read what it says

301
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,549
factor block and don't read what it says there which is computationally better to

302
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:11,650
there which is computationally better to work with

303
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:11,660


304
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:17,110
no don't read this okay I don't have time to go and make an omission from the

305
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,819
time to go and make an omission from the slides right life you store any

306
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,220
slides right life you store any complicated making these clients so

307
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,850
complicated making these clients so Mitchell twelve this part of everything

308
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,530
Mitchell twelve this part of everything is confidential and graham easier to

309
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,230
is confidential and graham easier to work with for inference this or not and

310
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:37,230
work with for inference this or not and why David easiest Christian ethnic

311
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:43,480
why David easiest Christian ethnic alright I'm sorry to kill her now you're

312
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,850
alright I'm sorry to kill her now you're so famous you know around the world you

313
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,230
so famous you know around the world you know all the Chinese think who is the

314
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,010
know all the Chinese think who is the guy Nick

315
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,170
guy Nick you know so maybe we should turn the

316
00:17:50,170 --> 00:18:01,690
you know so maybe we should turn the camera so this is not the best option

317
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:01,700


318
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:07,600
I mean when you compare the two right what is different in the in the in the

319
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,950
what is different in the in the in the two photographs here this pastor is

320
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,760
two photographs here this pastor is welcome any notes three so let's say

321
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,620
welcome any notes three so let's say each of these variables has K value so

322
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,160
each of these variables has K value so it's K cubed complexity in sparkler here

323
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,280
it's K cubed complexity in sparkler here revolves how many nodes to so the

324
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,570
revolves how many nodes to so the complex disk X square now if K is very

325
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,250
complex disk X square now if K is very small right you will not make a

326
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,920
small right you will not make a difference for example if K is equal to

327
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:38,920
difference for example if K is equal to 105 not be difference that you know if

328
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,960
105 not be difference that you know if this is part you may have this in a much

329
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,870
this is part you may have this in a much bigger graph post this will make a huge

330
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,470
bigger graph post this will make a huge difference

331
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,770
difference this is ghost with K square this goes

332
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:54,140
this is ghost with K square this goes with take you all right

333
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,150


334
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:59,160
what

335
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,170


336
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:05,370
so let's just do one final example and we leave it there so this is a directed

337
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:10,169
we leave it there so this is a directed graph okay and this is sort of it's an

338
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:13,580
graph okay and this is sort of it's an antique abstract I think I you know I

339
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,580
antique abstract I think I you know I believe us probably did this on my own

340
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,310
believe us probably did this on my own here so it doesn't look very good but

341
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,110
here so it doesn't look very good but let's look at all the parts of tonight

342
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:27,539
let's look at all the parts of tonight so X ranch has no parents so we need to

343
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,520
so X ranch has no parents so we need to have a particle that represents the

344
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,180
have a particle that represents the effects Juan okay next week has no

345
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,860
effects Juan okay next week has no parents so we need to have a pastor of

346
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,900
parents so we need to have a pastor of the presents P of x2 now we have P of X

347
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,680
the presents P of x2 now we have P of X to be given x1 are you put is that no

348
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,490
to be given x1 are you put is that no I'm sorry p x3 give an X 1 and X 2 so

349
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,250
I'm sorry p x3 give an X 1 and X 2 so that this part third collects x1 and x2

350
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:56,880
that this part third collects x1 and x2 do you see that right you need to

351
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,909
do you see that right you need to collect basically X 1 X 2 and X 3 all

352
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:04,140
collect basically X 1 X 2 and X 3 all right let's see what else we have

353
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,539
right let's see what else we have we have P of X 5 given X 1 and X 3 X 5 X

354
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:14,520
we have P of X 5 given X 1 and X 3 X 5 X 1 and X 3 does this factor and then we

355
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,159
1 and X 3 does this factor and then we have X 1 given X 2 and X 3 and up this

356
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:22,370
have X 1 given X 2 and X 3 and up this part okay

357
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:22,380


358
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,419
this is an esoteric example but it's an important example but I will bypass it

359
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:31,560
important example but I will bypass it but give questions just ask me okay so

360
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,919
but give questions just ask me okay so what we're interested to do spark

361
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,419
what we're interested to do spark Congrats because if we have a directed

362
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:40,500
Congrats because if we have a directed graph

363
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,370
graph God has two parents and we moralize it

364
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,620
God has two parents and we moralize it we get loops but somehow you can

365
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,980
we get loops but somehow you can transform the situation here with loops

366
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,360
transform the situation here with loops to literally to a tree the alternative

367
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,970
to literally to a tree the alternative is a tree graph then we can do the sum

368
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,960
is a tree graph then we can do the sum product algorithm on a photograph that

369
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,370
product algorithm on a photograph that would be annual okay so does this look

370
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,590
would be annual okay so does this look like a plate to you or I shall here here

371
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,580
like a plate to you or I shall here here I have three nodes all right three nodes

372
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,049
I have three nodes all right three nodes here because I had these two single

373
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:14,669
here because I had these two single potentials you can clip off the string

374
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:16,620
potentials you can clip off the string of potentials there then here you have

375
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:23,630
of potentials there then here you have three nodes and let me see and you know

376
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,130
three nodes and let me see and you know as suppose here this was accurate order

377
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,169
as suppose here this was accurate order of importance timing and other single

378
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:30,480
of importance timing and other single potential there okay so is this looking

379
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,570
potential there okay so is this looking like a treating you

380
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:35,580


381
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,190
and he playin remember there's a single path from you known to any other normal

382
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,320
path from you known to any other normal but here we're not looking Anya the

383
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,269
but here we're not looking Anya the valuable notes were to incorporate also

384
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,999
valuable notes were to incorporate also the fact to note so if part of knowledge

385
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:50,450
the fact to note so if part of knowledge and variable nodes if you think of them

386
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,749
and variable nodes if you think of them as just different sets of notes you know

387
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:56,539
as just different sets of notes you know this is a tree okay so the question is

388
00:21:56,539 --> 00:22:00,649
this is a tree okay so the question is how can we do sort of inference and how

389
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:02,529
how can we do sort of inference and how we can extend the sum-product algorithm

390
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:08,359
we can extend the sum-product algorithm this part okay that's another example of

391
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,729
this part okay that's another example of 12 but we make it to a tree

392
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:16,759
12 but we make it to a tree okay so let's discuss what the algorithm

393
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,859
okay so let's discuss what the algorithm is going to look like so the only thing

394
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:22,430
is going to look like so the only thing I am going to need right now is the

395
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,830
I am going to need right now is the decomposition of the Joint Distribution

396
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:28,999
decomposition of the Joint Distribution as a product for factors and this will

397
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:31,190
as a product for factors and this will be my squared knowledge basically each

398
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,529
be my squared knowledge basically each of these factors in principle okay

399
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:38,840
of these factors in principle okay so here is a decomposition of the Joint

400
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,210
so here is a decomposition of the Joint Distribution and you notice I have after

401
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,399
Distribution and you notice I have after a favor involves two variables that be

402
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:46,879
a favor involves two variables that be two variables actually variables and

403
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:51,739
two variables actually variables and it's the alone this is actually what is

404
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:55,430
it's the alone this is actually what is called bipartite facto graph okay you

405
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,470
called bipartite facto graph okay you notice there are no connections between

406
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:03,519
notice there are no connections between X 1 X 2 X 2 X 3 or between FASB ft etc

407
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:11,120
X 1 X 2 X 2 X 3 or between FASB ft etc all right

408
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,130


409
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:21,010
don't really need this don't really need this I am gonna bypass all of this and

410
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,020


411
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:29,620
all right so we need to discuss how we're gonna do incurring some on program

412
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:29,630


413
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:35,240
he's going to get conceptually complicated right so you need to get

414
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,470
complicated right so you need to get used to visualize as to what is going on

415
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,690
used to visualize as to what is going on and what the definition of the message

416
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:47,570
and what the definition of the message is is all about okay and sometimes we

417
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,000
is is all about okay and sometimes we have an out that and you notice there's

418
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,760
have an out that and you notice there's no text is unrolled here and we need to

419
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,910
no text is unrolled here and we need to compute the marginal of X okay so in

420
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,790
compute the marginal of X okay so in principle this is basically integrating

421
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,950
principle this is basically integrating out all the other variables but little X

422
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:06,950
out all the other variables but little X ok they are bolded that I am writing now

423
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,980
ok they are bolded that I am writing now the Joint Distribution of all the

424
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:15,050
the Joint Distribution of all the variables X s this product that we see

425
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,210
variables X s this product that we see here but let's clearly define what the

426
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,300
here but let's clearly define what the location is so there's no that's here is

427
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:27,830
location is so there's no that's here is surrounded by factors because okay sorry

428
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,880
surrounded by factors because okay sorry I'm looking now to this factor FS all

429
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,450
I'm looking now to this factor FS all right now think if you take this 3 and

430
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,850
right now think if you take this 3 and you put X on the top it is a three

431
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,520
you put X on the top it is a three writes all of this part is going to be

432
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,690
writes all of this part is going to be coming down as one three and that three

433
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,340
coming down as one three and that three originates from the factory first

434
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,010
originates from the factory first because strictly this is a three all

435
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:55,280
because strictly this is a three all right so can we look at this equation

436
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,980
right so can we look at this equation and and before I go to the next slide

437
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,340
and and before I go to the next slide tell me what is this function they are

438
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,550
tell me what is this function they are going to be like what is it you need to

439
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,980
going to be like what is it you need to give me an equation but looking at short

440
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,990
give me an equation but looking at short it's reached here the Joint Distribution

441
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,070
it's reached here the Joint Distribution of all the axis is the product of these

442
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:16,040
of all the axis is the product of these functions would subscribe this so all a

443
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,180
functions would subscribe this so all a system of our neighbors

444
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,850
system of our neighbors so far in fact those that the neighbors

445
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,399
so far in fact those that the neighbors affect so this factor and that factor

446
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:28,919
affect so this factor and that factor and that factor etc invisible if you

447
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,080
and that factor etc invisible if you look at that factor you get 1/3 if you

448
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,180
look at that factor you get 1/3 if you look at this factor another tree if you

449
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,360
look at this factor another tree if you look about another dissipate so what do

450
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,399
look about another dissipate so what do you think is F subscript the first

451
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:47,160
you think is F subscript the first little X comma capital X first

452
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,170


453
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:52,260
so you will agree with me light so this is a fat fella fest this node will be

454
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,090
is a fat fella fest this node will be connected to another factor which will

455
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,430
connected to another factor which will be connected to another node with other

456
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,250
be connected to another node with other factors etc and each comes with its

457
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,570
factors etc and each comes with its potential so when I say F subscript the

458
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,050
potential so when I say F subscript the first blue t-rex this is the advantage X

459
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:10,350
first blue t-rex this is the advantage X comma X test what is not first noticed

460
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:16,500
comma X test what is not first noticed XS you take capital X Earth there are a

461
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:23,080
XS you take capital X Earth there are a collection of knowledge which knows

462
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,090


463
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:29,680
on the subtree double originates basically on the track to attach so all

464
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,129
basically on the track to attach so all the nodes that we have over there

465
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:38,169
the nodes that we have over there I call them expert okay it next it is

466
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:41,080
I call them expert okay it next it is there to remind me that I am looking at

467
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,239
there to remind me that I am looking at factors that are connected with text I

468
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:48,430
factors that are connected with text I need to make to define that when I say

469
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,610
need to make to define that when I say yes light actually is a factor of this a

470
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,659
yes light actually is a factor of this a neighbor or text so I need to have the

471
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,759
neighbor or text so I need to have the written text there this is an advantage

472
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,389
written text there this is an advantage X okay and what do you think in the

473
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:08,920
X okay and what do you think in the capital of F capital F subscript test

474
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:08,930


475
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:17,380
what is a level on this from this term of the state I mean we say right joy

476
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,980
of the state I mean we say right joy care is you know this node and this node

477
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,170
care is you know this node and this node is connected to a factor which connected

478
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,690
is connected to a factor which connected to another known factor and again is

479
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,000
to another known factor and again is note the factor two other notes and a

480
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,870
note the factor two other notes and a factor so what do you think this at

481
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:39,470
factor so what do you think this at subscript assets

482
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:39,480


483
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,590
it is before the potentials ready for the fastest on the sub three but

484
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:50,570
the fastest on the sub three but originates from this factory first right

485
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:56,570
originates from this factory first right first on this sub 3 alright so the

486
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,310
first on this sub 3 alright so the product of all of those you do not have

487
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:02,440
product of all of those you do not have to strip of s so do not confuse those

488
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,419
to strip of s so do not confuse those with this part because this factor

489
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:07,940
with this part because this factor involved showing the potential that has

490
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,009
involved showing the potential that has this now this node and that node but

491
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:13,700
this now this node and that node but there is no fear there is no there is no

492
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,759
there is no fear there is no there is no there etcetera okay and there are more

493
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:19,610
there etcetera okay and there are more factors but the quality is that this

494
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:26,960
factors but the quality is that this whole thing is a sub 3

495
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:26,970


496
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:32,540
all right okay obviously if this is meant to play right you won't be able to

497
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,920
meant to play right you won't be able to do okay so I you know we need to pay

498
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,470
do okay so I you know we need to pay attention here so I you know I know what

499
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:43,160
attention here so I you know I know what I'm talking so excess the nose and said

500
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,720
I'm talking so excess the nose and said the four variables in the subject

501
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,820
the four variables in the subject collected the variable node X we are the

502
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,280
collected the variable node X we are the factor of the fest and this represents

503
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,840
factor of the fest and this represents the product before the carcass in the

504
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,270
the product before the carcass in the group associated with After Effects okay

505
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:59,180
group associated with After Effects okay this is what we just said no I am

506
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,220
this is what we just said no I am grateful you remember I'm interested

507
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,590
grateful you remember I'm interested would say that's why is related this

508
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,270
would say that's why is related this need to know that I'm interested in the

509
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:09,110
need to know that I'm interested in the marginal effects alright so if you want

510
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,360
marginal effects alright so if you want to the marginal effects what do we need

511
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,150
to the marginal effects what do we need to do in so this is your factorization

512
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:17,030
to do in so this is your factorization it's a nice way to factorize the joint

513
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,280
it's a nice way to factorize the joint distribution if I only need the marginal

514
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:24,530
distribution if I only need the marginal of this node what do I need to do I need

515
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:28,460
of this node what do I need to do I need to integrate out which variables all of

516
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,360
to integrate out which variables all of this volume of capital affects best

517
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,160
this volume of capital affects best solution else right so basically for

518
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,410
solution else right so basically for every trade that originates from this

519
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,180
every trade that originates from this part of service that there are neighbors

520
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,850
part of service that there are neighbors of little X I need to integrate the

521
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:47,560
of little X I need to integrate the nodes are created with all stop treats

522
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,920
nodes are created with all stop treats so whether I need to do I need so I had

523
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,380
so whether I need to do I need so I had the product of this function I need to

524
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,960
the product of this function I need to sell its father has its own notes

525
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,590
sell its father has its own notes alright so I can bring the salmon side

526
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,300
alright so I can bring the salmon side so everything you know you've got the

527
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,260
so everything you know you've got the idea here so do I need to integrate the

528
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,760
idea here so do I need to integrate the success out in this summation where I

529
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,100
success out in this summation where I have integrated all of this variables

530
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,370
have integrated all of this variables how I define it to be the message coming

531
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:21,700
how I define it to be the message coming from the factor test to know relax

532
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:21,710


533
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:28,690
it's a definition so what is this message clearly it is the you know it

534
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,300
message clearly it is the you know it originates from the product of all of

535
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,460
originates from the product of all of these potentials when I have integrated

536
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,880
these potentials when I have integrated out all the variable success and the

537
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,590
out all the variable success and the only variable that is left is the

538
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,480
only variable that is left is the variable little X so I call this I

539
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,990
variable little X so I call this I define this so basically what this says

540
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,240
define this so basically what this says is that the marginal of the little node

541
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,390
is that the marginal of the little node X is the product of all the messages are

542
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,480
X is the product of all the messages are arriving when the problem that our

543
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,660
arriving when the problem that our neighbors to little X ok so basically to

544
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,210
neighbors to little X ok so basically to compute the marginal effects what you

545
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,130
compute the marginal effects what you need to do is eliminate all the

546
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,440
need to do is eliminate all the variables here and compute the message

547
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,090
variables here and compute the message that comes from this factor to this node

548
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:10,090
that comes from this factor to this node eliminate all the variables up there and

549
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,830
eliminate all the variables up there and compute the stresses or they're not

550
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,160
compute the stresses or they're not message the product of this messages

551
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,610
message the product of this messages basically gives you the marginal P of

552
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,810
basically gives you the marginal P of leaflets in game don't confuse the bold

553
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:26,680
leaflets in game don't confuse the bold X is all variables and bold X is this

554
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,330
X is all variables and bold X is this particular part

555
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:33,130
particular part so the definition here is the message

556
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,970
so the definition here is the message from that reflects is the product of all

557
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,770
from that reflects is the product of all of the factors affiliating in the

558
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,110
of the factors affiliating in the subtree where all the volume of success

559
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,270
subtree where all the volume of success have been integrated out except little X

560
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,440
have been integrated out except little X ok makes sense

561
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,980
ok makes sense I mean this is that the elimination

562
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,380
I mean this is that the elimination Albert right we need to eliminate so

563
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,200
Albert right we need to eliminate so what we do is eliminate in it some three

564
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,620
what we do is eliminate in it some three affiliated with this factor that

565
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,650
affiliated with this factor that neighbors known X okay and we can do

566
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,890
neighbors known X okay and we can do this elimination here separately because

567
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,900
this elimination here separately because one once you have this rule it lets this

568
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,570
one once you have this rule it lets this is one three so you can eliminate the

569
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,030
is one three so you can eliminate the accessories and you can assign them

570
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,600
accessories and you can assign them they're right and this is the message

571
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,530
they're right and this is the message that comes from a factor to another such

572
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,500
that comes from a factor to another such a weird concept right because mr. body

573
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,300
a weird concept right because mr. body will know that before we were talking

574
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,730
will know that before we were talking about messages between body moves but

575
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,890
about messages between body moves but now we talk about the lessons that is

576
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,620
now we talk about the lessons that is propagating from a Paxton Road which the

577
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,510
propagating from a Paxton Road which the function to know and again it's rare but

578
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,410
function to know and again it's rare but it's not weird

579
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,270
it's not weird once you know what the definition is

580
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,970
once you know what the definition is what it implies and in eastern graphical

581
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,970
what it implies and in eastern graphical phones Clark was really with the devices

582
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,740
phones Clark was really with the devices take the product of all the factors here

583
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:54,430
take the product of all the factors here and integrate out excess that's it okay

584
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,550
and integrate out excess that's it okay and we baptize this to be the message

585
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:01,180
and we baptize this to be the message that comes from the fact amount to a

586
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:11,610
that comes from the fact amount to a variable no okay

587
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:11,620


588
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:19,139
of course you may ask me I forgot many messages from a node to a factory cause

589
00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:22,049
messages from a node to a factory cause they need to be so right I mean

590
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:23,759
they need to be so right I mean otherwise you know what I'm gonna be

591
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:26,129
otherwise you know what I'm gonna be able to make a lot of sense so let's see

592
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:30,950
able to make a lot of sense so let's see what is further why don't you all right

593
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,919
what is further why don't you all right so we defined this okay now we need to

594
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:37,830
so we defined this okay now we need to define the message of goes from a factor

595
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:42,029
define the message of goes from a factor to a note okay

596
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:44,519
to a note okay the message that goes from the fact that

597
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:51,029
the message that goes from the fact that we'll know okay and instability will

598
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,330
we'll know okay and instability will exactly mean obviously if you're gonna

599
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:57,029
exactly mean obviously if you're gonna need message from this factor to this

600
00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:01,440
need message from this factor to this node right you need to get rid of

601
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,499
node right you need to get rid of everything here all right you need to

602
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:06,450
everything here all right you need to eliminate on this Parliament and to

603
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,950
eliminate on this Parliament and to eliminate these variables whatever

604
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:14,500
eliminate these variables whatever potential star is being involved

605
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:14,510


606
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:20,200
you remember this is a potential that connects let's say node X 1 X 2 with

607
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,569
connects let's say node X 1 X 2 with level X 10 is just for demonstration

608
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:26,799
level X 10 is just for demonstration purposes in various the little node X

609
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,510
purposes in various the little node X that's the label of a purse and I want

610
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,970
that's the label of a purse and I want to find the message that this part of

611
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:34,569
to find the message that this part of nonsense to review next this is a

612
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:39,990
nonsense to review next this is a function we invest is a function alright

613
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:43,379
function we invest is a function alright so this a function what we the thing is

614
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:48,450
so this a function what we the thing is GM of XM x sm based on what we discussed

615
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,680
GM of XM x sm based on what we discussed you know with a similar relation we

616
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,960
you know with a similar relation we discussed for a fact from before with

617
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,799
discussed for a fact from before with the 3 appeared so what do you think so

618
00:34:56,799 --> 00:34:58,299
the 3 appeared so what do you think so here i need to account for all the

619
00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:01,990
here i need to account for all the potentials right involved on this

620
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,120
potentials right involved on this subtree and the only thing I have is

621
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,339
subtree and the only thing I have is this factor in the nose that is being

622
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:06,970
this factor in the nose that is being collected

623
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,490
collected so I have to account from whatever comes

624
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,039
so I have to account from whatever comes with its narrow so one day the thing is

625
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:20,980
with its narrow so one day the thing is GM affects mx7 in simple words will be

626
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,670
GM affects mx7 in simple words will be the product of what I mean I see this

627
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,680
the product of what I mean I see this node next time right that is one of the

628
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,780
node next time right that is one of the nodes connecting with the first except

629
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:38,470
nodes connecting with the first except that so this would be what

630
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:38,480


631
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:45,840
obviously share there must be a three right so the fact that I denoted with GM

632
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:51,610
right so the fact that I denoted with GM XL and then capital x sm the notation

633
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,050
XL and then capital x sm the notation looks to be similar to what we had

634
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,050
looks to be similar to what we had before so what do you think it is

635
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,110
before so what do you think it is so what does subscript there XM means

636
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,240
so what does subscript there XM means basically what I'm looking on the sub

637
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,320
basically what I'm looking on the sub tree of the year you would know that

638
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,430
tree of the year you would know that time what is capital affects yourself

639
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:08,440


640
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,360
this is the step of all the nodes involved without the sub tree and why do

641
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,940
involved without the sub tree and why do I put the subscript s there to remind

642
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,260
I put the subscript s there to remind myself that this node extent is enabled

643
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,390
myself that this node extent is enabled at first because I'm interested figure

644
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,300
at first because I'm interested figure out what is the message the fact or FS

645
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,330
out what is the message the fact or FS sense to know that you need to know that

646
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,880
sense to know that you need to know that I'm only looking at the nonce extent

647
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,740
I'm only looking at the nonce extent that are connected with a factor

648
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:38,710
that are connected with a factor attached okay okay so you know I'm gonna

649
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,740
attached okay okay so you know I'm gonna have you know I'm gonna have something

650
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:47,080
have you know I'm gonna have something like that Michigan okay you know because

651
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,630
like that Michigan okay you know because we shan't you know we have this

652
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:57,550
we shan't you know we have this potential affiliated with right so like

653
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:02,490
potential affiliated with right so like this like that though explicitly

654
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,630
this like that though explicitly basically before right we took

655
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,630
basically before right we took everything affiliated with a factor of s

656
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,360
everything affiliated with a factor of s all right but now certified revealed is

657
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,510
all right but now certified revealed is now sexual act etc so I can write it

658
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:17,950
now sexual act etc so I can write it short awfully big differently so this is

659
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,590
short awfully big differently so this is exactly what we had before

660
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:23,560
exactly what we had before this is this all right now what I do is

661
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:29,980
this is this all right now what I do is I write it as the popular test times G

662
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,930
I write it as the popular test times G of at M G of X capital them etc

663
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:38,460
of at M G of X capital them etc this ain't the same entity before then

664
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,520
this ain't the same entity before then look I was looking on the product of all

665
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,400
look I was looking on the product of all the factors affiliated with this country

666
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,210
the factors affiliated with this country so now what I want to do is I want to

667
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,730
so now what I want to do is I want to write this explicitly by having the

668
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,410
write this explicitly by having the oppressed so I have to account for that

669
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:58,490
oppressed so I have to account for that times the product of this J products of

670
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,810
times the product of this J products of factors a community with the substrates

671
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,690
factors a community with the substrates that are connected to each of them note

672
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:10,660
that are connected to each of them note actually to them to extract Allah

673
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:10,670


674
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:17,979
are you giving a Shadegg look all right charity and with it some to write down

675
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:20,380
charity and with it some to write down the product of all this functions so

676
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:24,960
the product of all this functions so this is a different way of writing it so

677
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:24,970


678
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:30,160
so effectively if you're interested to complete the message from this factor to

679
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,799
complete the message from this factor to the node X what you have to do is in

680
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:34,509
the node X what you have to do is in that expression that they have to do is

681
00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:37,779
that expression that they have to do is you have to integrate out the variables

682
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:41,559
you have to integrate out the variables x1 xn right because you know this is

683
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:43,420
x1 xn right because you know this is what I have but also you have to

684
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,759
what I have but also you have to integrate out all the variables

685
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:47,200
integrate out all the variables affiliated with which of this have

686
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,799
affiliated with which of this have placed which are should have put

687
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:54,039
placed which are should have put actually less there okay it's alright so

688
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,900
actually less there okay it's alright so we have them to make that by without as

689
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:02,829
we have them to make that by without as well okay so before we had this times

690
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:05,470
well okay so before we had this times this product and now I have to integrate

691
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,660
this product and now I have to integrate all the variables with little X to find

692
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,390
all the variables with little X to find the message that this factor sends to X

693
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:14,380
the message that this factor sends to X so the product of x1 to XM has to be

694
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,809
so the product of x1 to XM has to be outside because this is a function of X

695
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:20,470
outside because this is a function of X 1 X 10 and here I have to integrate out

696
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,960
1 X 10 and here I have to integrate out all this volume of success term

697
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,509
all this volume of success term affiliated with this subtree that hangs

698
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:27,789
affiliated with this subtree that hangs out of know that self and this is what

699
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:31,779
out of know that self and this is what this thing does so if you look carefully

700
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:35,380
this thing does so if you look carefully on again similar to the definition we

701
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,880
on again similar to the definition we gave before here what we do is we are

702
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,589
gave before here what we do is we are eliminating one of this volume of

703
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:45,249
eliminating one of this volume of successor so enhancing the elimination

704
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,349
successor so enhancing the elimination variable elimination you get rid of

705
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:50,259
variable elimination you get rid of anything below so that is left is the

706
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:53,200
anything below so that is left is the message that goes from this subtree to

707
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,979
message that goes from this subtree to the factor assess the Conservatives is

708
00:39:56,979 --> 00:40:01,599
the factor assess the Conservatives is eliminated selectively what behaviors if

709
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,880
eliminated selectively what behaviors if you have that the message from the first

710
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,789
you have that the message from the first two acts is summation of all of these

711
00:40:06,789 --> 00:40:10,809
two acts is summation of all of these variables of the factor of x times the

712
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,910
variables of the factor of x times the product of all the incoming messages

713
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,670
product of all the incoming messages from the nodes X little m2 X capital

714
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,120
from the nodes X little m2 X capital length to the factory first

715
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,130


716
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:24,800
depression is Tibbets easily right so the message that goes out from here to

717
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,910
the message that goes out from here to there is this factor times all the

718
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,680
there is this factor times all the messages coming from this node to this

719
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,330
messages coming from this node to this factor all right

720
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:35,470
factor all right and this mess is remember claimed by

721
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:38,480
and this mess is remember claimed by eliminating restaurants on each of these

722
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:38,990
eliminating restaurants on each of these terms

723
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:42,710
terms okay so and then of course when you

724
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,560
okay so and then of course when you multiply this so this factor time is

725
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,720
multiply this so this factor time is these messages you have to integrate the

726
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,850
these messages you have to integrate the variables actually to left half of the

727
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:53,510
variables actually to left half of the level out so what is left is a function

728
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,610
level out so what is left is a function of little X and that's the message from

729
00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:00,140
of little X and that's the message from a factor H to the bottom will non-visual

730
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:05,420
a factor H to the bottom will non-visual X makes a little sense again you know

731
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,850
X makes a little sense again you know what I the way to say it is sort of

732
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:13,760
what I the way to say it is sort of graphical right and if usually write

733
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,100
graphical right and if usually write something that's out of common sense you

734
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,910
something that's out of common sense you cannot go wrong okay so the lessons from

735
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:25,130
cannot go wrong okay so the lessons from lists from FS to X is this factor time

736
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,200
lists from FS to X is this factor time solve incoming messages to this factor

737
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,750
solve incoming messages to this factor and then you have to get rid basically

738
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,920
and then you have to get rid basically because each of these messed is a

739
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,560
because each of these messed is a function of this nodes so you have to

740
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,140
function of this nodes so you have to integrate all of this well tau

741
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,170
integrate all of this well tau okay and again you may say again what

742
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,520
okay and again you may say again what are this rest of this piece of the

743
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,230
are this rest of this piece of the message wants to eliminate everything

744
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:48,200
message wants to eliminate everything past what those particular node all

745
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,660
past what those particular node all right

746
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:51,670


747
00:41:51,670 --> 00:42:06,170
so what we have is we have so let me go back to the two equations all right

748
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:06,180


749
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:15,829
so here we have an equation well I don't want this one actually okay so we've

750
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:19,730
want this one actually okay so we've basically discussed the way to propagate

751
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,339
basically discussed the way to propagate messages from the fact of your note and

752
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:26,980
messages from the fact of your note and then from the know into your factor okay

753
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,130
then from the know into your factor okay all right

754
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,069
all right so actually I'm sorry from a notice let

755
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:34,160
so actually I'm sorry from a notice let me let me just go back to this okay so

756
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,859
me let me just go back to this okay so if you want to find the message okay

757
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:41,569
if you want to find the message okay from XM to FS all right so from a notice

758
00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:44,900
from XM to FS all right so from a notice after be available to me this is the

759
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,999
after be available to me this is the operation we did right we Lehman ate it

760
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:49,160
operation we did right we Lehman ate it on this sub tree we liberated this

761
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,890
on this sub tree we liberated this validates the sound definition three

762
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,589
validates the sound definition three lines there all right when we get me the

763
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:56,720
lines there all right when we get me the for the variables both extend and get

764
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,239
for the variables both extend and get basically the message from X term to the

765
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:00,140
basically the message from X term to the fact to the test

766
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:05,210
fact to the test okay and you can write this explicitly

767
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:09,259
okay and you can write this explicitly as the product of all the fact of

768
00:43:09,259 --> 00:43:11,989
as the product of all the fact of functions are creating with this sub 3m

769
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,989
functions are creating with this sub 3m they're a filmic afters but the factor

770
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:17,420
they're a filmic afters but the factor appears because your interest to figure

771
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,700
appears because your interest to figure out what is the message this node sends

772
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,499
out what is the message this node sends to the first so you're not going to

773
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:23,180
to the first so you're not going to count the masses of questions to the no

774
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:28,390
count the masses of questions to the no right so here is the product of all this

775
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,160
right so here is the product of all this functions if you like except the ones

776
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,190
functions if you like except the ones the laconic of the first electors

777
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:36,370
the laconic of the first electors protectively to compute the messages

778
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:40,370
protectively to compute the messages from a node to a factor what do you have

779
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:44,720
from a node to a factor what do you have to do so this is a know then you want to

780
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,489
to do so this is a know then you want to find the message for this nonsense the

781
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:49,609
find the message for this nonsense the factor take all the messages that all

782
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:51,529
factor take all the messages that all the neighbors of this now the accept

783
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:54,380
the neighbors of this now the accept this fact or send it to it this node and

784
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,170
this fact or send it to it this node and then propagator so basically the masters

785
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,599
then propagator so basically the masters extreme says the first is the product of

786
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,329
extreme says the first is the product of this message here and that message and

787
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:04,370
this message here and that message and that message and of course you don't

788
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,229
that message and of course you don't account the message to the first you

789
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:08,150
account the message to the first you don't want to send to a password sent to

790
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,470
don't want to send to a password sent to you

791
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:16,550
a little bit of chance so basically you can sit on top for the elimination

792
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,500
can sit on top for the elimination algorithm

793
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,340
algorithm port risk in inaction well you know it's

794
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,250
port risk in inaction well you know it's all you can know you can do this simply

795
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,910
all you can know you can do this simply because these are twists so if you hand

796
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,950
because these are twists so if you hand it from anywhere you basically get the

797
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:36,380
it from anywhere you basically get the subtree and you know you need to

798
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,230
subtree and you know you need to understand going to relations the

799
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,150
understand going to relations the relation that you see on the top which

800
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,300
relation that you see on the top which is the message the fact or nonsense 2x20

801
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,930
is the message the fact or nonsense 2x20 know that very easily take the factor

802
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:50,180
know that very easily take the factor function Organists arriving to the

803
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,980
function Organists arriving to the factor from its neighbor nodes except

804
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,020
factor from its neighbor nodes except this intellect and integrate all the

805
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,300
this intellect and integrate all the variables out but little X and then

806
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,880
variables out but little X and then similarly if you wanna message that in

807
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,490
similarly if you wanna message that in all sense the fact or take all of its

808
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,230
all sense the fact or take all of its neighbor factors for fit the message

809
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:07,640
neighbor factors for fit the message they send to him and in basically not to

810
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,720
they send to him and in basically not to be the message you can propagate

811
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,660
be the message you can propagate reference boundary conditions because at

812
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,090
reference boundary conditions because at the end of the day you'll either when we

813
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,220
the end of the day you'll either when we apply this you'll be either at the leaf

814
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,310
apply this you'll be either at the leaf zone you would be at the root so if it

815
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:26,120
zone you would be at the root so if it happens that this is the leaf node and

816
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,640
happens that this is the leaf node and it's a valuable node then the Lester's

817
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,640
it's a valuable node then the Lester's accents to the first factor you set it

818
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,599
accents to the first factor you set it equal to one alright so let's learn

819
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,880
equal to one alright so let's learn yourself so if it happens actually but

820
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,070
yourself so if it happens actually but in your path of love the first thing the

821
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,040
in your path of love the first thing the leaf node is a factor then the message

822
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,230
leaf node is a factor then the message that you sent to the person all

823
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:46,880
that you sent to the person all correctly this factor is the function f

824
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,800
correctly this factor is the function f of X okay so we're gonna do some shorty

825
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,999
of X okay so we're gonna do some shorty some examples

826
00:45:56,999 --> 00:45:57,009


827
00:45:57,009 --> 00:46:06,970
and I think even if you program this for your you know for your next homework I

828
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:08,920
your you know for your next homework I will suggest asam this examples to try

829
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,870
will suggest asam this examples to try to do things by can to convince

830
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:12,640
to do things by can to convince yourselves that the algebra doesn't

831
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,620
yourselves that the algebra doesn't accept ok so before I start showing you

832
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,900
accept ok so before I start showing you some examples they need to say that in

833
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,039
some examples they need to say that in principle you don't even have to bother

834
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,640
principle you don't even have to bother to discuss about messages sent by nodes

835
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,690
to discuss about messages sent by nodes to factors

836
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,880
to factors I mean in principle you can see the

837
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,339
I mean in principle you can see the whole algorithm the stump of the table

838
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:35,559
whole algorithm the stump of the table with four paragraphs as best in this

839
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:39,970
with four paragraphs as best in this tenth of the factors because for example

840
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:43,390
tenth of the factors because for example you may say but I need the message that

841
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:45,940
you may say but I need the message that to compute this little message I need to

842
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,499
to compute this little message I need to know the message this node sends to the

843
00:46:47,499 --> 00:46:49,059
know the message this node sends to the sparkler second multiplied with this

844
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:49,569
sparkler second multiplied with this message

845
00:46:49,569 --> 00:46:53,980
yes I know that but the message that this is nonsense to this factor is what

846
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,440
this is nonsense to this factor is what message is the message of this Pakistan

847
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,940
message is the message of this Pakistan to is no so you can go directly from

848
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,729
to is no so you can go directly from messages factor sent to this nodes and

849
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:05,589
messages factor sent to this nodes and to this note that they are neighbors of

850
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,479
to this note that they are neighbors of a test and then multiply all this

851
00:47:07,479 --> 00:47:09,640
a test and then multiply all this together to get the blue message from

852
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,450
together to get the blue message from this factor to the law or check so you

853
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:16,989
this factor to the law or check so you can bypass basically if you want the

854
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:21,700
can bypass basically if you want the need of having you know bestest is

855
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:28,420
need of having you know bestest is programs factors and artist notes

856
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:28,430


857
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:32,579
now I know this a little bit is not actually this is a very easy example

858
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:37,809
actually this is a very easy example alright so actually you know what I'm

859
00:47:37,809 --> 00:47:41,170
alright so actually you know what I'm gonna you know this thing would with

860
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:43,180
gonna you know this thing would with chains you know actually this is not the

861
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,769
chains you know actually this is not the state space model is exchanged so

862
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:46,839
state space model is exchanged so actually I think good we can do this

863
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:47,289
actually I think good we can do this problem

864
00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:50,859
problem alright so imagine you have a Markov

865
00:47:50,859 --> 00:47:54,250
alright so imagine you have a Markov chain okay so this is plaintext n minus

866
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:58,289
chain okay so this is plaintext n minus 1 this is Excel this is xn plus 1 and

867
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:01,029
1 this is Excel this is xn plus 1 and let's say the only thing we prescribe is

868
00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:03,190
let's say the only thing we prescribe is the dynamics of the chain would say

869
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:06,700
the dynamics of the chain would say basically what's the probability of xn

870
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,519
basically what's the probability of xn given xn minus 1 this Markovian what's

871
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,859
given xn minus 1 this Markovian what's the probability of xn plus 1 given excel

872
00:48:11,859 --> 00:48:14,319
the probability of xn plus 1 given excel and I wanna be someone I want to

873
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:20,349
and I wanna be someone I want to basically polish this elimination

874
00:48:20,349 --> 00:48:26,170
basically polish this elimination algorithm or sum product algorithm so

875
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,029
algorithm or sum product algorithm so I'm going to take the map of say and

876
00:48:28,029 --> 00:48:31,620
I'm going to take the map of say and transfer it to factor graphs all right

877
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,299
transfer it to factor graphs all right it's very rare to do this because the

878
00:48:34,299 --> 00:48:35,769
it's very rare to do this because the problem is trivial but on the other hand

879
00:48:35,769 --> 00:48:39,549
problem is trivial but on the other hand sort of an instructive so this have

880
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:41,440
sort of an instructive so this have everybody knows what the map of more

881
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,289
everybody knows what the map of more than this right have this now and who

882
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:46,059
than this right have this now and who they're going to be next best for you of

883
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:48,880
they're going to be next best for you of the poor okay so this have the notes so

884
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,160
the poor okay so this have the notes so whether this I don't know what color is

885
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,440
whether this I don't know what color is not yellow or whatever what are the

886
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,359
not yellow or whatever what are the square boxes now the factors so what is

887
00:48:58,359 --> 00:49:00,609
square boxes now the factors so what is this factor accounting is very than

888
00:49:00,609 --> 00:49:02,769
this factor accounting is very than service factor let's say this is the

889
00:49:02,769 --> 00:49:08,019
service factor let's say this is the probability effectively of the

890
00:49:08,019 --> 00:49:10,260
probability effectively of the transition from xn minus 1 to accept

891
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,720
transition from xn minus 1 to accept right and this is the probability of

892
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,480
right and this is the probability of transition from xn plus 1 from xn to xn

893
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:22,329
transition from xn plus 1 from xn to xn plus 1 etc ok so we said the fact of

894
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:22,339


895
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:29,769
so let's say that somehow we're going to blind that the you know this rules I

896
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:32,499
blind that the you know this rules I gave you for sending messages from a

897
00:49:32,499 --> 00:49:34,299
gave you for sending messages from a fact if you know them from another

898
00:49:34,299 --> 00:49:37,900
fact if you know them from another factor on this chain to say if things

899
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:44,160
factor on this chain to say if things make sense okay you know I think

900
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,019
make sense okay you know I think actually you know it's already in there

901
00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:48,910
actually you know it's already in there in the slides that you just passed right

902
00:49:48,910 --> 00:50:06,640
in the slides that you just passed right if you want to compute the marginal it

903
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,939
if you want to compute the marginal it is basically the products of the

904
00:50:09,939 --> 00:50:13,299
is basically the products of the messages the factor let's say n minus 1

905
00:50:13,299 --> 00:50:17,289
messages the factor let's say n minus 1 tends to know them and the product the

906
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:21,939
tends to know them and the product the factor n tends to the node extent so

907
00:50:21,939 --> 00:50:23,890
factor n tends to the node extent so let's see this graphically if you want

908
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,319
let's see this graphically if you want to find the maximum of this node is

909
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,419
to find the maximum of this node is effectively the product of this message

910
00:50:28,419 --> 00:50:33,239
effectively the product of this message and the product about versus remembering

911
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:36,400
and the product about versus remembering right how do you calculate marginals you

912
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,109
right how do you calculate marginals you take the messages coming from the left

913
00:50:38,109 --> 00:50:41,859
take the messages coming from the left of the light on it say sir here on the

914
00:50:41,859 --> 00:50:44,199
of the light on it say sir here on the left is a factor now sending a message

915
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:45,939
left is a factor now sending a message on the right there's another protocol

916
00:50:45,939 --> 00:50:49,539
on the right there's another protocol notes and innocence which are under a

917
00:50:49,539 --> 00:50:52,209
notes and innocence which are under a third list as a given and I'm going to

918
00:50:52,209 --> 00:50:55,359
third list as a given and I'm going to see how this looks like you know to

919
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,699
see how this looks like you know to sleep we can recognize if it gives us

920
00:50:57,699 --> 00:51:00,989
sleep we can recognize if it gives us anything familiar so this is the factor

921
00:51:00,989 --> 00:51:03,370
anything familiar so this is the factor so we're looking here right so it's the

922
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:09,429
so we're looking here right so it's the factor this passport right don't pay

923
00:51:09,429 --> 00:51:12,609
factor this passport right don't pay attention to the estimation is this

924
00:51:12,609 --> 00:51:18,459
attention to the estimation is this message this message there equal to two

925
00:51:18,459 --> 00:51:20,799
message this message there equal to two this summation and from queries are

926
00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:22,790
this summation and from queries are coming

927
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:26,390
coming with words Michigan this is the listed

928
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:48,080
with words Michigan this is the listed from this to this one

929
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,200
from this to this one so what you do is take the factor which

930
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,240
so what you do is take the factor which is this n minus 1 n does the conditional

931
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,640
is this n minus 1 n does the conditional probability really okay times the

932
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,610
probability really okay times the message that comes from the node xn

933
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:07,210
message that comes from the node xn minus 1 to this factor fn- trunk away

934
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:14,000
minus 1 to this factor fn- trunk away yes right and stimuli I want to find the

935
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,040
yes right and stimuli I want to find the message from this structure to this node

936
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,880
message from this structure to this node that is again this factor right which is

937
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,880
that is again this factor right which is this point incoming message from node xn

938
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,220
this point incoming message from node xn plus 1 to this factor and then you have

939
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,710
plus 1 to this factor and then you have to integrate now the xn plus 1 so at the

940
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,450
to integrate now the xn plus 1 so at the end of the day everything is only

941
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:37,890
end of the day everything is only function of xn okay so now

942
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:40,820
function of xn okay so now [Applause]

943
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:44,990
[Applause] when your day with me but this message

944
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:52,310
when your day with me but this message here is the same as that message is not

945
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:55,440
here is the same as that message is not the case

946
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:55,450


947
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:59,670
now wait a second if I go to the say shorty do it here with me now I see this

948
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:03,630
shorty do it here with me now I see this so we calculated this right as this part

949
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:08,340
so we calculated this right as this part four times I'm sure we calculated this

950
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,710
four times I'm sure we calculated this message as this part of times this

951
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:14,550
message as this part of times this message and we integrate without any xn

952
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:18,120
message and we integrate without any xn minus 1 so let's look now at this

953
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,430
minus 1 so let's look now at this incoming message which is from no xn

954
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,500
incoming message which is from no xn minus 1 to the smartphone when you

955
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,510
minus 1 to the smartphone when you believe that this message is the same as

956
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:30,630
believe that this message is the same as that message because not way I'm going

957
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,400
that message because not way I'm going to save this message this is messages

958
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,860
to save this message this is messages from facto specific alright so there's

959
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,690
from facto specific alright so there's no potentially or anything like that so

960
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:39,300
no potentially or anything like that so this message is the same as that message

961
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,300
this message is the same as that message so what I have my share I substitute

962
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,000
so what I have my share I substitute this mister as the message coming from

963
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,150
this mister as the message coming from the factor FN minus 2 there no basic and

964
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:52,140
the factor FN minus 2 there no basic and the N minus 1 okay and similarly I think

965
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,450
the N minus 1 okay and similarly I think this misses to be the same is not missed

966
00:53:54,450 --> 00:54:00,750
this misses to be the same is not missed it's all right and I write like that to

967
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,270
it's all right and I write like that to these messages and I call this the Alpha

968
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:05,670
these messages and I call this the Alpha message and I call this the different

969
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:10,250
message and I call this the different masters so the Alpha message is computed

970
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,710
masters so the Alpha message is computed from left to right for our calculations

971
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:16,170
from left to right for our calculations you can see this you know to country if

972
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,540
you can see this you know to country if there is an cancel relation here if I

973
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:22,500
there is an cancel relation here if I call this my for a text n minus 1

974
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:27,270
call this my for a text n minus 1 you know what this whole thing is that

975
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:28,830
you know what this whole thing is that name should I give to this from term

976
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:32,970
name should I give to this from term there

977
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:32,980


978
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:40,950
is the total addresses in our heart external and this if I call this M beta

979
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:43,770
external and this if I call this M beta X n plus 1 all right

980
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:47,220
X n plus 1 all right xn plus 1 this whole thing what it is it

981
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,160
xn plus 1 this whole thing what it is it is in beta extent is the messed is

982
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:55,260
is in beta extent is the messed is coming to extend backwards if we do that

983
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,030
coming to extend backwards if we do that problem for a change the forward and the

984
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:00,960
problem for a change the forward and the backward messages so basically what you

985
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:06,050
backward messages so basically what you do here is you're recovering if you like

986
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:11,550
do here is you're recovering if you like the rules in enough extent as the triple

987
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:12,900
the rules in enough extent as the triple message which is what you see here

988
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,570
message which is what you see here literally cast of Lee and the bottles

989
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:17,190
literally cast of Lee and the bottles with a message which is what you see

990
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:21,599
with a message which is what you see here recursively I mean anything new in

991
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,270
here recursively I mean anything new in in this example but I wanted to just

992
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:28,080
in this example but I wanted to just simply start with this rather intensive

993
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:33,030
simply start with this rather intensive graph that is what it's supposed to do

994
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,890
graph that is what it's supposed to do and what is the post in different chains

995
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:37,290
and what is the post in different chains is best friend to compute this expand

996
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,530
is best friend to compute this expand with a further message propagation and a

997
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:42,450
with a further message propagation and a map of message propagation and then you

998
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,430
map of message propagation and then you multiply the Alpha and Beta messages and

999
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:47,970
multiply the Alpha and Beta messages and get the effexor and similarly you can

1000
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,260
get the effexor and similarly you can multiply the corresponding alpha

1001
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,570
multiply the corresponding alpha messages to get the marginal of this

1002
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:53,730
messages to get the marginal of this node and at least note and everywhere

1003
00:55:53,730 --> 00:56:03,470
node and at least note and everywhere else in the garden and ok

1004
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:03,480


1005
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:08,660
and obviously to starfish on what is right so if you need to use the boundary

1006
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:11,049
right so if you need to use the boundary conditions that are indicated before and

1007
00:56:11,049 --> 00:56:13,160
conditions that are indicated before and we have done this for the alpha-beta

1008
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,880
we have done this for the alpha-beta messages so if you take if you take this

1009
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,829
messages so if you take if you take this to be casted relation to the head before

1010
00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:22,789
to be casted relation to the head before so if you want the message that needs no

1011
00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:25,609
so if you want the message that needs no vex world to go to the facts the first

1012
00:56:25,609 --> 00:56:28,339
vex world to go to the facts the first part or basically what you need to do is

1013
00:56:28,339 --> 00:56:32,180
part or basically what you need to do is integrate x one from the potential to

1014
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,670
integrate x one from the potential to Taiwan to the first two nodes in the

1015
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:36,530
Taiwan to the first two nodes in the message from the first no to the first

1016
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:39,410
message from the first no to the first factor and we serve to take this equal

1017
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,870
factor and we serve to take this equal to one so you notice the first message

1018
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:43,670
to one so you notice the first message that comes is nothing else but

1019
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:47,270
that comes is nothing else but marginalization in X one of the

1020
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:51,950
marginalization in X one of the potential between nodes 1 &amp; 2 you really

1021
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,190
potential between nodes 1 &amp; 2 you really have to sort of spend some time doing

1022
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:57,740
have to sort of spend some time doing this turn and actually not spend some

1023
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:58,520
this turn and actually not spend some time do next

1024
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:02,690
time do next programmed it okay because sort of

1025
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:04,220
programmed it okay because sort of looking at it

1026
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,559
looking at it this just you know it's chained right so

1027
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,780
this just you know it's chained right so this is the most trivial case if we try

1028
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,880
this is the most trivial case if we try to do this and we're supposed to do this

1029
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,380
to do this and we're supposed to do this in two days or three days or two or

1030
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,470
in two days or three days or two or three lectures on the state space model

1031
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,180
three lectures on the state space model so we collect observations of the states

1032
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,720
so we collect observations of the states also you will see that things together

1033
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:29,740
also you will see that things together with not noisy okay but bottom line is

1034
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:35,380
with not noisy okay but bottom line is if you have messages that result from

1035
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:38,690
if you have messages that result from variable elimination and in a part of

1036
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:41,000
variable elimination and in a part of the office messages are messages from

1037
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,760
the office messages are messages from fastest nodes or promotes the past oh

1038
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,690
fastest nodes or promotes the past oh okay once these messages have been

1039
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:51,109
okay once these messages have been completed you can evaluate anything you

1040
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:54,170
completed you can evaluate anything you wish you can find marginals you can find

1041
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,280
wish you can find marginals you can find conditionals

1042
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,579
conditionals you can put evidence to the module joint

1043
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:04,069
you can put evidence to the module joint distributions etc etcetera all right so

1044
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:05,599
distributions etc etcetera all right so let's take a break and you guys will

1045
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,910
let's take a break and you guys will help me to do a not a change but a

1046
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:13,599
help me to do a not a change but a little bit more interesting problem

1047
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:13,609


1048
00:58:13,609 --> 00:58:21,470
still a pain problem so we have told note and we have our first dot this

1049
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:23,870
note and we have our first dot this partner connect nodes x1 x2 so function

1050
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:27,140
partner connect nodes x1 x2 so function of x1 x2 a function of X 2 X 3 and

1051
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:35,630
of x1 x2 a function of X 2 X 3 and function of X 2 X 4 let's say let me see

1052
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:38,390
function of X 2 X 4 let's say let me see what with it taste I mean that's suppose

1053
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,549
what with it taste I mean that's suppose we want to compute all the marginal

1054
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:44,839
we want to compute all the marginal distributions of this graph and you know

1055
00:58:44,839 --> 00:58:47,000
distributions of this graph and you know you evidence is not an issue you know

1056
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,339
you evidence is not an issue you know you just use slices of these

1057
00:58:49,339 --> 00:58:51,620
you just use slices of these distributions if you have evidence you

1058
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:54,349
distributions if you have evidence you know but let's say we want to find the

1059
00:58:54,349 --> 00:58:57,620
know but let's say we want to find the marginals of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 in this

1060
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:02,839
marginals of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 in this graph so using the this some other

1061
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,329
graph so using the this some other powerful factor graphs what do we need

1062
00:59:05,329 --> 00:59:09,290
powerful factor graphs what do we need to start doing

1063
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:09,300


1064
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:16,160
wouldn't be a step one so choose I don't know then can be anything doesn't really

1065
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:16,550
know then can be anything doesn't really matter

1066
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:20,210
matter okay so in this case let's say we take

1067
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:23,050
okay so in this case let's say we take the root node to be x1 all right so

1068
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,910
the root node to be x1 all right so there are start sending messages from

1069
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:28,430
there are start sending messages from root node to the sparkler then from this

1070
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:31,880
root node to the sparkler then from this photo to this node okay obviously

1071
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,560
photo to this node okay obviously descend from is known for this problem

1072
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,910
descend from is known for this problem you need to know what this kind of from

1073
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:37,220
you need to know what this kind of from below so you're going to have to send in

1074
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,010
below so you're going to have to send in lesson from export to this factor

1075
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:41,780
lesson from export to this factor compute this message then multiply these

1076
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:45,290
compute this message then multiply these messages you get that then integrate

1077
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,820
messages you get that then integrate this thing out through this posture and

1078
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,800
this thing out through this posture and then you get the message three and they

1079
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,740
then you get the message three and they stopped going backwards

1080
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:53,450
stopped going backwards alright so let's look at the

1081
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:58,040
alright so let's look at the calculations one of the tally a question

1082
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,990
calculations one of the tally a question one sir is the message from x1 to face

1083
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:11,050
one sir is the message from x1 to face is one why is that

1084
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:11,060


1085
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:17,200
I know about the weed we said it's a modern condition right it's the boundary

1086
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,600
modern condition right it's the boundary condition for this problem and it's

1087
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,400
condition for this problem and it's because there it carries the viable no

1088
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,040
because there it carries the viable no it's not a doctor okay and we will do

1089
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,390
it's not a doctor okay and we will do something with a factor maybe another

1090
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:32,170
something with a factor maybe another example so correct form to pay this mess

1091
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,570
example so correct form to pay this mess is equal to one now for let's try to

1092
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:38,830
is equal to one now for let's try to extend when we have to find this we have

1093
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:42,040
extend when we have to find this we have to take the passport multiplied with

1094
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,790
to take the passport multiplied with what with incoming message which is how

1095
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:49,180
what with incoming message which is how much one and then definitely the Flex

1096
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:54,580
much one and then definitely the Flex clock so if I wanted to add this terms

1097
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:57,910
clock so if I wanted to add this terms of explicit I would say is time the

1098
01:00:57,910 --> 01:01:01,770
of explicit I would say is time the summation x one right and but you get up

1099
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:09,280
summation x one right and but you get up okay so then let's say we are stuck here

1100
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,660
okay so then let's say we are stuck here because we need to compute things from

1101
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,880
because we need to compute things from below so we have to find the message for

1102
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,450
below so we have to find the message for x4 to FC that's also mountain collision

1103
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:23,620
x4 to FC that's also mountain collision okay so the message is one the message

1104
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,120
okay so the message is one the message that they've seized has to extrude I

1105
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,810
that they've seized has to extrude I have to eliminate X for the same way we

1106
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,970
have to eliminate X for the same way we do elimination through you get that and

1107
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:32,620
do elimination through you get that and now we are ready to send a message from

1108
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,560
now we are ready to send a message from X 2 to X B so the message is basically

1109
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,500
X 2 to X B so the message is basically the product of the Masters FASS X 2 and

1110
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,350
the product of the Masters FASS X 2 and if csun's trucks - so basically the

1111
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:45,330
if csun's trucks - so basically the Masters from X 2 to be is the product of

1112
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:51,100
Masters from X 2 to be is the product of Delta X 2 and FC books - okay and then

1113
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:55,600
Delta X 2 and FC books - okay and then the message from FB 2 X 3 is the factor

1114
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:00,970
the message from FB 2 X 3 is the factor B right times this message and then

1115
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:02,800
B right times this message and then extrude the veg out

1116
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:07,240
extrude the veg out I mean really if you can sort of do this

1117
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,280
I mean really if you can sort of do this graphically you don't have to remember

1118
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,230
graphically you don't have to remember any complicated

1119
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:14,830
any complicated right so everything will have a factor

1120
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:17,530
right so everything will have a factor what you need to remember is you have to

1121
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:20,350
what you need to remember is you have to multiply with a past or whatever

1122
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:22,240
multiply with a past or whatever incoming messages you have and then

1123
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,370
incoming messages you have and then going to grade or the volume of success

1124
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:34,570
going to grade or the volume of success the college's body okay all right now we

1125
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:37,060
the college's body okay all right now we went one way and remember to get sort of

1126
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,190
went one way and remember to get sort of marginal you have to go in every adds

1127
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:41,710
marginal you have to go in every adds what comes in and what you know what was

1128
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:44,830
what comes in and what you know what was in that directions of the of the edges

1129
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:46,780
in that directions of the of the edges of the graph so now we have to stop

1130
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,970
of the graph so now we have to stop sending a message from experience be one

1131
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:53,350
sending a message from experience be one from the matrix to a particle again time

1132
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:59,080
from the matrix to a particle again time Swan and integrated throughout now we

1133
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,030
Swan and integrated throughout now we let's see what's going on we're gonna

1134
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:04,570
let's see what's going on we're gonna start sending from extra class a can you

1135
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:06,490
start sending from extra class a can you send the message from X to go say now

1136
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:09,700
send the message from X to go say now look at the question I'm gonna want you

1137
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:14,370
look at the question I'm gonna want you to send a message from X to do a fairy

1138
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:14,380


1139
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:20,770
what we will need in order to send a message from Exeter to a peg we need to

1140
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:22,840
message from Exeter to a peg we need to know what message comes in this way

1141
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,580
know what message comes in this way which we contribute but also we need to

1142
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:26,740
which we contribute but also we need to know what miss this comes from the fact

1143
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:29,500
know what miss this comes from the fact that secret to and that message was

1144
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:33,910
that secret to and that message was computed from query from FC 2x2 was

1145
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:38,920
computed from query from FC 2x2 was completed in the forward step do not

1146
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:42,190
completed in the forward step do not exist and it is message should be the

1147
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,330
exist and it is message should be the forward message have already been

1148
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:52,200
forward message have already been calculated so now I have to account for

1149
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:52,210


1150
01:03:52,210 --> 01:04:01,600
in the stuff in the message from x22 at me

1151
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:01,610


1152
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:06,520
yes because so this is a variable node right there's no function involved

1153
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:16,990
right there's no function involved without any state because let's take you

1154
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:20,260
without any state because let's take you notice the message from FC 2 X 2 FC 2 X

1155
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:20,770
notice the message from FC 2 X 2 FC 2 X 2

1156
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:24,100
2 it's I'm sorry this was eliminated from

1157
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,430
it's I'm sorry this was eliminated from X 2 - oh yeah good point you're making

1158
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:31,750
X 2 - oh yeah good point you're making so what is this supposed to be so the

1159
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:35,950
so what is this supposed to be so the message let's again from FA 2 X 2

1160
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:38,020
message let's again from FA 2 X 2 alright will be a function of X do the

1161
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:40,780
alright will be a function of X do the math from FC 2 X 2 X 2 so this corrected

1162
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:44,820
math from FC 2 X 2 X 2 so this corrected okay this is extruder okay thank you

1163
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:47,580
okay this is extruder okay thank you remaining if you don't see it collected

1164
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:52,600
remaining if you don't see it collected by tomorrow morning okay all right

1165
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,610
by tomorrow morning okay all right did I correct on this slide which was

1166
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:58,960
did I correct on this slide which was the message actually plus B oh wait a

1167
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:04,090
the message actually plus B oh wait a second twenty six two two three do we

1168
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:11,589
second twenty six two two three do we have this any part here

1169
01:05:11,589 --> 01:05:11,599


1170
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:22,059
what with alright okay so so basically to find business that's right there to

1171
01:05:22,059 --> 01:05:24,009
to find business that's right there to multiply the message from left Beatrix -

1172
01:05:24,009 --> 01:05:29,279
multiply the message from left Beatrix - and then the message from FC 2 x - okay

1173
01:05:29,279 --> 01:05:35,380
and then the message from FC 2 x - okay then define the message from we have to

1174
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:37,089
then define the message from we have to find the message from extinct let's see

1175
01:05:37,089 --> 01:05:39,699
find the message from extinct let's see also then downwards write this message

1176
01:05:39,699 --> 01:05:47,219
also then downwards write this message there so that would be the from again

1177
01:05:47,219 --> 01:05:49,839
there so that would be the from again the missed incoming message from left be

1178
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:51,910
the missed incoming message from left be too extreme but also the message from

1179
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:54,219
too extreme but also the message from this peg to extremely computing table on

1180
01:05:54,219 --> 01:05:56,499
this peg to extremely computing table on the previous slide arrived which is this

1181
01:05:56,499 --> 01:05:58,180
the previous slide arrived which is this nested okay

1182
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:01,209
nested okay and of course if you want to find the

1183
01:06:01,209 --> 01:06:02,680
and of course if you want to find the message from it's cheap to explore that

1184
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,420
message from it's cheap to explore that is a factor involved so you have to

1185
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,939
is a factor involved so you have to multiply with a factor of T times the

1186
01:06:06,939 --> 01:06:09,130
multiply with a factor of T times the atomic mass is connected to 2 FC and

1187
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:15,749
atomic mass is connected to 2 FC and then integrate explode okay so basically

1188
01:06:15,749 --> 01:06:18,489
then integrate explode okay so basically the propagation of the messages between

1189
01:06:18,489 --> 01:06:21,309
the propagation of the messages between four factors notes and those factors the

1190
01:06:21,309 --> 01:06:26,279
four factors notes and those factors the same but when you are basically just

1191
01:06:26,279 --> 01:06:29,259
same but when you are basically just working with factors in eliminating

1192
01:06:29,259 --> 01:06:31,329
working with factors in eliminating factors in principle you have to

1193
01:06:31,329 --> 01:06:33,430
factors in principle you have to multiply with the fastest function okay

1194
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:36,549
multiply with the fastest function okay I mean usually very much here but the

1195
01:06:36,549 --> 01:06:40,269
I mean usually very much here but the idea is you know there is a function

1196
01:06:40,269 --> 01:06:42,069
idea is you know there is a function involved and not function is to be

1197
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:45,819
involved and not function is to be accounted explicitly so in here we don't

1198
01:06:45,819 --> 01:06:47,259
accounted explicitly so in here we don't have in fact also is basically the

1199
01:06:47,259 --> 01:06:49,180
have in fact also is basically the product of the messages here is the

1200
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:51,430
product of the messages here is the factor and whatever product of messages

1201
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:58,089
factor and whatever product of messages you have and then elimination so just to

1202
01:06:58,089 --> 01:07:01,269
you have and then elimination so just to show you but actually this during you

1203
01:07:01,269 --> 01:07:04,630
show you but actually this during you can do a lot of tests of your own right

1204
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:06,609
can do a lot of tests of your own right so let's say we want to compute the

1205
01:07:06,609 --> 01:07:10,719
so let's say we want to compute the marginal effects to go right so when you

1206
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,140
marginal effects to go right so when you scan based on what we said given the

1207
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:16,710
scan based on what we said given the marginal time you know this movement

1208
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:19,890
marginal time you know this movement normalized this cavity thing I don't

1209
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:22,380
normalized this cavity thing I don't know if it shows a lot of his demons

1210
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:24,720
know if it shows a lot of his demons will not come properly on the PDF so if

1211
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,980
will not come properly on the PDF so if you see that please let me know so if

1212
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:32,130
you see that please let me know so if you want the probability of x2 you have

1213
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:34,140
you want the probability of x2 you have to mess take the message from afraid to

1214
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,240
to mess take the message from afraid to do it because you have seen 2 X 2 which

1215
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,900
do it because you have seen 2 X 2 which is this and let's see for example if you

1216
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,690
is this and let's see for example if you want the message from afraid to

1217
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:45,930
want the message from afraid to experience - is FA with x1 integrates

1218
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:48,540
experience - is FA with x1 integrates out all right if they will fix one

1219
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:51,150
out all right if they will fix one degrees out similarly visitors this with

1220
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:55,830
degrees out similarly visitors this with x3 integrated x4 integrated so I can fly

1221
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:58,170
x3 integrated x4 integrated so I can fly this donation like that and actually

1222
01:07:58,170 --> 01:08:00,740
this donation like that and actually this is the joint where I have

1223
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:02,970
this is the joint where I have integrated out all the volumes for the

1224
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:04,800
integrated out all the volumes for the execution or visit us tomorrow

1225
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,210
execution or visit us tomorrow I mean to test biscuits show you that

1226
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:11,700
I mean to test biscuits show you that things are really working properly so

1227
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,320
things are really working properly so you know when you do problems like that

1228
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,480
you know when you do problems like that right you may want to just start one do

1229
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,850
right you may want to just start one do some trivial test to see that you wanna

1230
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:19,320
some trivial test to see that you wanna know me think don't prepare any

1231
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,600
know me think don't prepare any information and this for this trivial

1232
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,570
information and this for this trivial example you can see me that we've got

1233
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:29,010
example you can see me that we've got this equation that is product incoming

1234
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:31,820
this equation that is product incoming messages to know that - all right

1235
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:35,670
messages to know that - all right indeed gives you the marginal of now

1236
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:44,970
indeed gives you the marginal of now Dexter

1237
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:44,980


1238
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:48,600
all right I don't know if there's anything new on this example so I'm

1239
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:52,920
anything new on this example so I'm going to only fit Oh actually maybe we

1240
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,170
going to only fit Oh actually maybe we should do this example there just for a

1241
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:58,500
should do this example there just for a different so in this example the only

1242
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,360
different so in this example the only thing that is liquor at this I give you

1243
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:03,050
thing that is liquor at this I give you evidence that x1 is different rate

1244
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:07,740
evidence that x1 is different rate alright and and if you notice the

1245
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:10,820
alright and and if you notice the elimination algorithm I'd like we did

1246
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:15,870
elimination algorithm I'd like we did before practically identical the only

1247
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:21,060
before practically identical the only difference test that the you basically

1248
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:23,790
difference test that the you basically have to propagate the information that

1249
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:28,290
have to propagate the information that x1 is equal to a and the way to do this

1250
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,960
x1 is equal to a and the way to do this is by sending a delta function from x

1251
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,870
is by sending a delta function from x one platform and you can immediately see

1252
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,810
one platform and you can immediately see that this works because if you want the

1253
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:39,630
that this works because if you want the message at one time speaks to this would

1254
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:42,480
message at one time speaks to this would be the part where F 1 of X 1 X 2 times

1255
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,260
be the part where F 1 of X 1 X 2 times the incoming message and you notice

1256
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,970
the incoming message and you notice they're going to be understand this you

1257
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:50,280
they're going to be understand this you know it basically forces x1 take the

1258
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:56,790
know it basically forces x1 take the value a right so this is the only thing

1259
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:58,500
value a right so this is the only thing you need to do to account for evidence

1260
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,780
you need to do to account for evidence so if you have a homework problem for

1261
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,390
so if you have a homework problem for there's evidence there's nothing really

1262
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:05,850
there's evidence there's nothing really particular that is needed you know this

1263
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:13,319
particular that is needed you know this already takes care of

1264
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:13,329


1265
01:10:13,329 --> 01:10:20,479
I have a lot of job very simple sort of calculations but I want you to actually

1266
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:23,669
calculations but I want you to actually look at this equations and be sure that

1267
01:10:23,669 --> 01:10:26,399
look at this equations and be sure that you clearly understand because here you

1268
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:28,649
you clearly understand because here you know in summation product this of that

1269
01:10:28,649 --> 01:10:29,910
know in summation product this of that is like what is that

1270
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:32,240
is like what is that where is very simple it's all related

1271
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:35,580
where is very simple it's all related with this tree structure and in the

1272
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:38,640
with this tree structure and in the factors we have defined over the trees

1273
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,060
factors we have defined over the trees but what I wanted to prove for your

1274
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:45,330
but what I wanted to prove for your world in two lines but if somehow you're

1275
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:48,390
world in two lines but if somehow you're interesting to compute the modulo have

1276
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:50,189
interesting to compute the modulo have told the notes of the age in the fall

1277
01:10:50,189 --> 01:10:52,260
told the notes of the age in the fall apart or severe a factor and he's

1278
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:53,640
apart or severe a factor and he's connecting the change of three or four

1279
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,220
connecting the change of three or four nodes and you wonder why 0

1280
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:58,910
nodes and you wonder why 0 look how easy the calculation looks like

1281
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:02,850
look how easy the calculation looks like take the factor corresponding to all

1282
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:05,280
take the factor corresponding to all these variables and multiply multiply

1283
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,580
these variables and multiply multiply the frozen coming note that there are

1284
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:12,899
the frozen coming note that there are main works of the factor so here let's

1285
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:16,020
main works of the factor so here let's say if I have the two nodes right it

1286
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:18,330
say if I have the two nodes right it takes Technol factor which exists and

1287
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:22,770
takes Technol factor which exists and taken out the product of so this is you

1288
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:29,280
taken out the product of so this is you know three months take the product of

1289
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,530
know three months take the product of the neighbors knowledge of this part or

1290
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:33,750
the neighbors knowledge of this part or at best and multiply this message is

1291
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:36,169
at best and multiply this message is coming in okay the look is basically

1292
01:11:36,169 --> 01:11:40,500
coming in okay the look is basically given in one line by using this concept

1293
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:48,760
given in one line by using this concept again of

1294
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:48,770


1295
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:55,120
and again you know I let's do this this if this makes sense if you want to take

1296
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,460
if this makes sense if you want to take here define them up the marginal of

1297
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:00,040
here define them up the marginal of nodes x1 and x2 just to convince you of

1298
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:04,330
nodes x1 and x2 just to convince you of this is correct so based on the thing

1299
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:06,910
this is correct so based on the thing that I proved here and you guys should

1300
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:09,040
that I proved here and you guys should leave if you are the marginal of extra

1301
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,150
leave if you are the marginal of extra next to it would be the factor the

1302
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:16,960
next to it would be the factor the message that comes to the factor f f of

1303
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,110
message that comes to the factor f f of x1 the fact of the messenger comes from

1304
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:23,670
x1 the fact of the messenger comes from node executes to pay which is that and

1305
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:26,830
node executes to pay which is that and the message from X 1 to phase 2 equal

1306
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:31,810
the message from X 1 to phase 2 equal comments this is similar to what we did

1307
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:33,940
comments this is similar to what we did in the examples before how much is this

1308
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:37,300
in the examples before how much is this vessel 1 all right that's a boundary

1309
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:40,030
vessel 1 all right that's a boundary condition and the message coming to an

1310
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:43,630
condition and the message coming to an extreme to FA the message coming from X

1311
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:46,240
extreme to FA the message coming from X you to a say this it's interesting all

1312
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,940
you to a say this it's interesting all right from XA will be the most

1313
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:52,090
right from XA will be the most astounding then this cocktail to this

1314
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:55,120
astounding then this cocktail to this node and from this cocktail of yo shall

1315
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,390
node and from this cocktail of yo shall we be the message from a2 and the metal

1316
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:00,880
we be the message from a2 and the metal from F Street - its - and what is the

1317
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,990
from F Street - its - and what is the message conical met need to experience

1318
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:08,680
message conical met need to experience the mess is coming is the fact that x

1319
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,420
the mess is coming is the fact that x there mrs. Caleigh forextrader this

1320
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:14,350
there mrs. Caleigh forextrader this factor which is how much 1 to the death

1321
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:16,930
factor which is how much 1 to the death desolation times that summation and if I

1322
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:17,950
desolation times that summation and if I put yourself sorry

1323
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:19,960
put yourself sorry you basically have to integrate whole

1324
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,580
you basically have to integrate whole body moves but 3 &amp; 4

1325
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,080
body moves but 3 &amp; 4 obviously that will give you the

1326
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:29,140
obviously that will give you the marginal P of X 1 X 2 again don't you

1327
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:31,180
marginal P of X 1 X 2 again don't you cannot bring all of these things to

1328
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:34,120
cannot bring all of these things to prove this right but this is sort of far

1329
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:43,160
prove this right but this is sort of far but somehow it worked it's you know ok

1330
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:43,170


1331
01:13:43,170 --> 01:14:22,040
you can as well okay if you want to find the marginal of Nordic tae-won preview a

1332
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:26,120
the marginal of Nordic tae-won preview a way to do it is actually on the edge

1333
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,130
way to do it is actually on the edge between the factors paths of the Nordics

1334
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,680
between the factors paths of the Nordics I think the product of the two messages

1335
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:34,880
I think the product of the two messages in both directions to Trevor no atoms

1336
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,860
in both directions to Trevor no atoms connected to a factor of one the modular

1337
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,990
connected to a factor of one the modular both node take the Masters this way

1338
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:41,510
both node take the Masters this way times the message that way that will

1339
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:45,080
times the message that way that will actually give me the monster very nice

1340
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:48,200
actually give me the monster very nice sort of quick result in computing margin

1341
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,650
sort of quick result in computing margin but again what I want you to sort of

1342
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:54,080
but again what I want you to sort of appreciate this for Devon backward

1343
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,360
appreciate this for Devon backward messages right that's a universal thing

1344
01:14:56,360 --> 01:15:01,400
messages right that's a universal thing in in all of this type of calculations

1345
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,620
in in all of this type of calculations right you need to be able to propagate

1346
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:06,380
right you need to be able to propagate evidence from the leaves to the root and

1347
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:09,590
evidence from the leaves to the root and then anon works evidence from the root

1348
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:11,660
then anon works evidence from the root to the left and only then you can

1349
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:14,180
to the left and only then you can compute whatever your interest and do

1350
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:19,939
compute whatever your interest and do inference another time

1351
01:15:19,939 --> 01:15:19,949


1352
01:15:19,949 --> 01:15:29,689
right there's nothing on the remaining of the slides except chatter for summary

1353
01:15:29,689 --> 01:15:32,540
of the slides except chatter for summary of the algorithm but we just discussion

1354
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:37,939
of the algorithm but we just discussion factor graphs and well has done here is

1355
01:15:37,939 --> 01:15:42,669
factor graphs and well has done here is I have just annotations from Jordans

1356
01:15:42,669 --> 01:15:46,630
I have just annotations from Jordans reprint of I sent you a little time and

1357
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:50,240
reprint of I sent you a little time and with noisiest to emphasize basically the

1358
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:52,189
with noisiest to emphasize basically the different sort of type of messages we

1359
01:15:52,189 --> 01:15:56,290
different sort of type of messages we have he uses the symbols new to indicate

1360
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:59,150
have he uses the symbols new to indicate messages for variables to factors and

1361
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:02,000
messages for variables to factors and then he uses the symbol new for messages

1362
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,180
then he uses the symbol new for messages contacted variables and basically they

1363
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:09,200
contacted variables and basically they update formulas are the same as what we

1364
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,950
update formulas are the same as what we had seen already in the lecture so if

1365
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:16,520
had seen already in the lecture so if you want you know for example if you

1366
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:22,209
you want you know for example if you want to find the lessons from a factor

1367
01:16:22,209 --> 01:16:25,610
want to find the lessons from a factor to a node do you have to take the factor

1368
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:28,189
to a node do you have to take the factor itself all the messages coming from all

1369
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:30,080
itself all the messages coming from all the nodes which are new messages and

1370
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,330
the nodes which are new messages and then you integrate all of this variables

1371
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:35,060
then you integrate all of this variables out except variable X I and this will

1372
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:38,510
out except variable X I and this will give you this and similarly this the

1373
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:42,410
give you this and similarly this the message from unknown the factor we have

1374
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:44,689
message from unknown the factor we have to find the product of all the best is

1375
01:16:44,689 --> 01:16:48,439
to find the product of all the best is coming from all other factors except

1376
01:16:48,439 --> 01:16:50,419
coming from all other factors except this one but their neighbors of X I

1377
01:16:50,419 --> 01:16:53,600
this one but their neighbors of X I multiply them and that will do the job

1378
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,110
multiply them and that will do the job so the other if it is a copy cover of

1379
01:16:57,110 --> 01:17:01,340
so the other if it is a copy cover of the algorithm we have seen for this but

1380
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:04,510
the algorithm we have seen for this but the only thing that you see here is

1381
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:09,500
the only thing that you see here is there is nunca left right there is no

1382
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,770
there is nunca left right there is no distribute no connect and so because you

1383
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:15,890
distribute no connect and so because you know we have two sets of messages both

1384
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:17,479
know we have two sets of messages both going from the leaves to the root and

1385
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:19,340
going from the leaves to the root and the root to the leaves but apart from

1386
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:22,290
the root to the leaves but apart from that effectively

1387
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:25,500
that effectively if you give a try to wrangle it to go to

1388
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:29,340
if you give a try to wrangle it to go to another algorithm is basically minimal

1389
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:33,210
another algorithm is basically minimal work all right that's the algorithm and

1390
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:36,270
work all right that's the algorithm and there's another example you read it and

1391
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:41,670
there's another example you read it and we take it from there but they still

1392
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:43,530
we take it from there but they still thirsty I keep forgetting even though I

1393
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:45,360
thirsty I keep forgetting even though I don't even remember the day today

1394
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,580
don't even remember the day today all right so single Thursday and there

1395
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,980
all right so single Thursday and there is a point of view because we do not you

1396
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:51,300
is a point of view because we do not you are not interested to even get an

1397
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,980
are not interested to even get an expansion or anything like that so

1398
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:55,980
expansion or anything like that so there's no extension
