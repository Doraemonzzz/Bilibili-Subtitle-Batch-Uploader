1
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:18,030
all right the time still 30-some I make an attempt to to put something on the

2
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,730
an attempt to to put something on the website half an hour ago

3
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,190
website half an hour ago so the lecture from last Tuesday and

4
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,430
so the lecture from last Tuesday and today's lecture must be there okay

5
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,359
today's lecture must be there okay the rest is available starters I'm going

6
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,219
the rest is available starters I'm going to be collecting what I had coming okay

7
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,499
to be collecting what I had coming okay and I think probably two more on will

8
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:41,370
and I think probably two more on will email those register some topics from

9
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,430
email those register some topics from books to read

10
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,380
books to read let's see another announcement we're

11
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,050
let's see another announcement we're going to post an early homework but it's

12
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,969
going to post an early homework but it's nobody need you for another three weeks

13
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:53,639
nobody need you for another three weeks or so but I want you to just know what

14
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:56,219
or so but I want you to just know what is coming and just not reading and in

15
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:57,510
is coming and just not reading and in the process of the homework we're going

16
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,910
the process of the homework we're going to have recitation tomorrow

17
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,040
to have recitation tomorrow so should we can introduce you to

18
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,830
so should we can introduce you to yesterday we did move what you have done

19
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,810
yesterday we did move what you have done introducing led me to some programming

20
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,479
introducing led me to some programming aspects cocoa from vista graphical focus

21
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,580
aspects cocoa from vista graphical focus because I think the Wake is preparing

22
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,640
because I think the Wake is preparing the homeworks he wants you to start

23
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,860
the homeworks he wants you to start building little libraries that

24
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,039
building little libraries that eventually lead to large-scale problems

25
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,400
eventually lead to large-scale problems now if you don't want us to develop this

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,759
now if you don't want us to develop this libraries in homework 1 we're gonna pass

27
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,470
libraries in homework 1 we're gonna pass the solutions so you can use from the

28
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,920
the solutions so you can use from the second part hours but lastly whatever we

29
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,690
second part hours but lastly whatever we post does it means the right thing I

30
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,960
post does it means the right thing I mean we are also students and we post

31
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,750
mean we are also students and we post whatever so hopefully you can do better

32
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,920
whatever so hopefully you can do better than than us and hopefully there are

33
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,490
than than us and hopefully there are solutions we post are your solutions

34
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,220
solutions we post are your solutions that's why I want you to factor right up

35
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,850
that's why I want you to factor right up and paste okay

36
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,759
and paste okay and what was the other announcement and

37
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,470
and what was the other announcement and so in this process of we will have a

38
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,170
so in this process of we will have a recitation this Friday but as I told me

39
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,840
recitation this Friday but as I told me very station the same ways the lectures

40
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,450
very station the same ways the lectures are not

41
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,730
are not thorry so if you don't like to see me

42
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,020
thorry so if you don't like to see me you don't have to come you know there

43
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,060
you don't have to come you know there are video lectures everything is online

44
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,850
are video lectures everything is online you can watch me from your kitchen

45
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,800
you can watch me from your kitchen basically we're getting a cup of coffee

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,180
basically we're getting a cup of coffee but there's gondola station at the same

47
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,330
but there's gondola station at the same time of driving and again net1 Authority

48
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,390
time of driving and again net1 Authority because hold information will be posted

49
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,360
because hold information will be posted and so the homework the Lexus okay so

50
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,590
and so the homework the Lexus okay so you will notice when you reveal the

51
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,930
you will notice when you reveal the slides from let's do one there are some

52
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,170
slides from let's do one there are some topics that are not covered okay now

53
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,570
topics that are not covered okay now those topics are really some little bit

54
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,760
those topics are really some little bit more examples from the concepts that was

55
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,920
more examples from the concepts that was trying to communicate some of them are

56
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,480
trying to communicate some of them are going to come in this lecture so I don't

57
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,070
going to come in this lecture so I don't have to do them some lady 3d will cover

58
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,400
have to do them some lady 3d will cover on Friday some we have to read them on

59
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,410
on Friday some we have to read them on your own okay and but if there is

60
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,810
your own okay and but if there is anything essential I will go back to it

61
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,270
anything essential I will go back to it okay if I don't cover it means we don't

62
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,820
okay if I don't cover it means we don't really need it for the shell code so for

63
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,240
really need it for the shell code so for example there is a big case study of

64
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,380
example there is a big case study of publicity graphical model related to the

65
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,140
publicity graphical model related to the biology and as you guys know there is

66
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,840
biology and as you guys know there is nobody from biology actually I was asked

67
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,700
nobody from biology actually I was asked yesterday polygamy I said we have any

68
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,530
yesterday polygamy I said we have any students in biology doing this type of

69
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:32,230
students in biology doing this type of things like not sorry you know so I

70
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,020
things like not sorry you know so I don't know if I stopped working for 20

71
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,690
don't know if I stopped working for 20 minutes in biology and I did clicker on

72
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,110
minutes in biology and I did clicker on the slide maybe a third of humans

73
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,820
the slide maybe a third of humans reached biology and that is not gonna be

74
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,980
reached biology and that is not gonna be good right

75
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,380
good right pointing all the way around okay

76
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:49,390


77
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:56,590
we're going to start discussing a limit about conditional independence relations

78
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,410
about conditional independence relations and graphs but the context of

79
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,950
and graphs but the context of theoretical aspects of this conditional

80
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,510
theoretical aspects of this conditional independence relations not the graphs

81
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,230
independence relations not the graphs represent this is sort of an impure much

82
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,809
represent this is sort of an impure much so we will probably go back to it again

83
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:16,140
so we will probably go back to it again and again for the next 23 weeks so we

84
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,580
and again for the next 23 weeks so we have a very reduced understanding so -

85
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,710
have a very reduced understanding so - you can take the concepts today the

86
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,320
you can take the concepts today the lecture scrolling up you'd be easy but

87
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,330
lecture scrolling up you'd be easy but you know you don't have from the stir

88
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:38,150
you know you don't have from the stir everything ok this is if you have

89
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,290
everything ok this is if you have variables are showing absolutely zero

90
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,820
variables are showing absolutely zero independence relations this is an

91
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,040
independence relations this is an appreciation of the visionary all right

92
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,270
appreciation of the visionary all right so look at it carefully

93
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:55,170
so look at it carefully all right not x1 x2 given x1 x2 be given

94
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:00,900
all right not x1 x2 given x1 x2 be given x2 x1 several different positions like

95
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,430
x2 x1 several different positions like that because for example I can start

96
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,770
that because for example I can start with x2 and the next one you will

97
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:10,740
with x2 and the next one you will experience x3 given you know x1 and x3

98
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,610
experience x3 given you know x1 and x3 etc etc so in essence you have very

99
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,670
etc etc so in essence you have very shove those and in some ways are not

100
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,620
shove those and in some ways are not symmetric right the way that I write

101
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,909
symmetric right the way that I write them so same sort of symmetry sphere ok

102
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:29,490
them so same sort of symmetry sphere ok this expansion is very expensive to do

103
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,050
this expansion is very expensive to do so just nibble on this if we have you

104
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,930
so just nibble on this if we have you say K values for its variable X and you

105
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,670
say K values for its variable X and you have both no so this will require a

106
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,719
have both no so this will require a table of the order of KT power V and

107
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:46,890
table of the order of KT power V and this is the reason really we started

108
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,740
this is the reason really we started probabilistic graphical models because

109
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,830
probabilistic graphical models because we be asking a question structures can

110
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,649
we be asking a question structures can you actually simplify this conditional

111
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,749
you actually simplify this conditional distributions accountable for some

112
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:59,850
distributions accountable for some independence relations other ways you

113
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,580
independence relations other ways you know looking at this is well explore

114
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,310
know looking at this is well explore given x1 depends on x2 and x3 telling

115
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,730
given x1 depends on x2 and x3 telling the trend of x2 and x3 the answer is yes

116
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,150
the trend of x2 and x3 the answer is yes we would

117
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:15,930
we would factorization that is very efficient so

118
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,510
factorization that is very efficient so the discount that I did here it does not

119
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,790
the discount that I did here it does not account for normalization of each of

120
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,610
account for normalization of each of these probabilities which is really it

121
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,980
these probabilities which is really it doesn't remove much of the cost and so

122
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,420
doesn't remove much of the cost and so when you want a perfect one

123
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,120
when you want a perfect one you can okay numbers to describe it k

124
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,390
you can okay numbers to describe it k square to describe excellent even x1

125
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,930
square to describe excellent even x1 take you to describe this and take the

126
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,810
take you to describe this and take the power bill escape to describe now we'll

127
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,980
power bill escape to describe now we'll study machine learning right if you have

128
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,240
study machine learning right if you have missed admission like that and if you

129
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,090
missed admission like that and if you want to visit in the context in the self

130
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,430
want to visit in the context in the self classification problems there's a lot of

131
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,070
classification problems there's a lot of text you can do but you don't have to

132
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,420
text you can do but you don't have to deal with complexity of K to the me and

133
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,300
deal with complexity of K to the me and so here's one example I'm going to

134
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,190
so here's one example I'm going to making tables for each of this

135
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,930
making tables for each of this conditional probability distributions

136
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:15,420
conditional probability distributions but inverse you replace them with

137
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,010
but inverse you replace them with logistic regression ordinates looks like

138
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,170
logistic regression ordinates looks like that

139
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:26,050
alright so delicious that you see here it's so tight and we're from the field

140
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,330
it's so tight and we're from the field itself in here it depends on all the

141
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,600
itself in here it depends on all the previous axis so I try to fit this

142
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,219
previous axis so I try to fit this distribution of science enjoyed a

143
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,310
distribution of science enjoyed a function with a rival of somewhat it's

144
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,150
function with a rival of somewhat it's doubly times the vector X for a for the

145
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,450
doubly times the vector X for a for the previous ones and then we may have not

146
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,990
previous ones and then we may have not seen this but yeah vs. are different

147
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,540
seen this but yeah vs. are different there's no no services sigmoid function

148
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,210
there's no no services sigmoid function and the focus of a label to take the K

149
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,860
and the focus of a label to take the K component of the argument and there is a

150
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,580
component of the argument and there is a nice model for this provision from a

151
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,420
nice model for this provision from a movie

152
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,130
movie of them and you won't have to fix a

153
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,890
of them and you won't have to fix a thing with to describe them okay now

154
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,190
thing with to describe them okay now it's not but the question is normally

155
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,320
it's not but the question is normally and I have the calculation here so if

156
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,800
and I have the calculation here so if anybody has any places from the power I

157
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,350
anybody has any places from the power I get it it's actually still taller than

158
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,330
get it it's actually still taller than they want you to do the odds of those

159
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,280
they want you to do the odds of those different against yourself so it comes

160
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,840
different against yourself so it comes out of the the the post of this is K

161
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,770
out of the the the post of this is K times miss Claire before the possible

162
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,850
times miss Claire before the possible straight to the power of me you know

163
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,820
straight to the power of me you know it's okay to whisper so it's really I

164
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,460
it's okay to whisper so it's really I mean depends offensively is but they

165
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,620
mean depends offensively is but they they significantly reduce from above

166
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,150
they significantly reduce from above course okay however this method is not

167
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,830
course okay however this method is not very useful because each of this

168
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,020
very useful because each of this conditional distributions depends on the

169
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,100
conditional distributions depends on the values of all the other previous

170
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,100
values of all the other previous variables so you want to be able to do

171
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,530
variables so you want to be able to do maths very sort of business in the

172
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,130
maths very sort of business in the college software plus fire so if you

173
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,530
college software plus fire so if you want people mixtures and you want five

174
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,920
want people mixtures and you want five modules you know account for evidence

175
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,690
modules you know account for evidence and things like that you won't be able

176
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,960
and things like that you won't be able to do the algebra using this module okay

177
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,070
to do the algebra using this module okay but again there is more than this one we

178
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,650
but again there is more than this one we have the tables nice fried this had some

179
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:21,680
have the tables nice fried this had some function alright and in this case a few

180
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,870
function alright and in this case a few this matrix not many once you have it

181
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,850
this matrix not many once you have it then this could be an easy problem

182
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,340
then this could be an easy problem figure in the context of classification

183
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,070
figure in the context of classification so what I want to do this in this course

184
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:38,360
so what I want to do this in this course we won't do something better some basic

185
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,150
we won't do something better some basic things probability integral syndrome

186
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,160


187
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:50,690
conditional independence so I have 1 divided by XY and Z can be scalar K

188
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,590
divided by XY and Z can be scalar K vector so I say that x and y are

189
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,590
vector so I say that x and y are conditionally independent given Z 1 FX 2

190
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,220
conditionally independent given Z 1 FX 2 the y and z is equal to B FX given C ok

191
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,020
the y and z is equal to B FX given C ok so tom is a normal something of Drive

192
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,390
so tom is a normal something of Drive make a difference when it comes to the

193
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,170
make a difference when it comes to the value of x okay so this is one way to

194
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,100
value of x okay so this is one way to I'd the traditional dependent of X for y

195
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,680
I'd the traditional dependent of X for y double Z this important that's why you

196
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,510
double Z this important that's why you say conditional because there is an

197
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:25,120
say conditional because there is an argument either now cosmas if you think

198
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,550
argument either now cosmas if you think this is a definition let me say the

199
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,430
this is a definition let me say the simple algebra right I can write this

200
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,710
simple algebra right I can write this more effectively y and z and then P of Y

201
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,800
more effectively y and z and then P of Y given Z so those are this I can write

202
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,310
given Z so those are this I can write this as P of X given Z P of Y given C so

203
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,370
this as P of X given Z P of Y given C so we can advances in the Commission to

204
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,120
we can advances in the Commission to life as an alternative way that when

205
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,430
life as an alternative way that when this conditional distribution for price

206
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,730
this conditional distribution for price is like knob Direction Y an independent

207
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,630
is like knob Direction Y an independent commission along Z okay so sometimes

208
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,910
commission along Z okay so sometimes this will be convenient sometimes this

209
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,560
this will be convenient sometimes this they are exactly the same thing that's

210
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,610
they are exactly the same thing that's good

211
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:02,620


212
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:20,830
okay dependence relationship also in terms of sets of random variables so we

213
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,750
terms of sets of random variables so we can either assent affection for

214
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,000
can either assent affection for environments is developing once that

215
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,530
environments is developing once that wagon easy when texas independent of Y

216
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:33,580
wagon easy when texas independent of Y given Z for every X in the set X and

217
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,900
given Z for every X in the set X and everyone in the sidewalk okay

218
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,970
everyone in the sidewalk okay and actually this Zia can make it also

219
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,360
and actually this Zia can make it also set so I maybe that we have been even

220
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,050
set so I maybe that we have been even more generalized reversals in there now

221
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,910
more generalized reversals in there now for example we say this set of the very

222
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,160
for example we say this set of the very most is independent that given that set

223
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,800
most is independent that given that set variable so this basically will follow

224
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,770
variable so this basically will follow this definition here

225
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:58,780


226
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,690
the repellents we listen to this sort of orthogonality condition but in some

227
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,090
orthogonality condition but in some probability looks mr. personality

228
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,890
probability looks mr. personality condition may imply something else

229
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,010
condition may imply something else usually defined in terms of expectations

230
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,190
usually defined in terms of expectations okay

231
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,260
okay but for us this is the notation we're

232
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:21,960
but for us this is the notation we're going to use muscle independence

233
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,730
going to use muscle independence basically you know we take this

234
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,770
basically you know we take this definition for example means of

235
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:31,020
definition for example means of perfection y is given p FX he apply okay

236
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,320
perfection y is given p FX he apply okay I was just looking at this slide right

237
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,630
I was just looking at this slide right you can stab it sometimes because you

238
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,690
you can stab it sometimes because you see for example have I'm using the

239
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,210
see for example have I'm using the notation carrying them in a violent way

240
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,400
notation carrying them in a violent way but hopefully we can still get the

241
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,880
but hopefully we can still get the message for example you know here I lose

242
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,500
message for example you know here I lose capital X and wife on the bottom was

243
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,400
capital X and wife on the bottom was here in little x and y then effectively

244
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,660
here in little x and y then effectively the same force but you know

245
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,730
the same force but you know traditionally this would be the lot of

246
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,470
traditionally this would be the lot of the volume or this will be the values

247
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,540
the volume or this will be the values that are the vitamin can take but you

248
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,810
that are the vitamin can take but you know we're okay right we're not gonna

249
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,610
know we're okay right we're not gonna see you know sorry you with a little X

250
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,980
see you know sorry you with a little X you know it's gonna tell you I type this

251
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,710
you know it's gonna tell you I type this slide at least we have some slides to

252
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,470
slide at least we have some slides to talk about the wrong papers you know

253
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:17,760
talk about the wrong papers you know it's good idea to sort of be careful and

254
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,770
it's good idea to sort of be careful and consistent because much than you're

255
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:27,570
consistent because much than you're consistent okay so this mess intent of

256
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,370
consistent okay so this mess intent of this conditional and marginal

257
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:37,200
this conditional and marginal independence okay so I am saying here

258
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,930
independence okay so I am saying here that this whole time is independent of

259
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:46,230
that this whole time is independent of the type of the car okay

260
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,240


261
00:14:46,240 --> 00:15:04,249
[Music]

262
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:04,259


263
00:15:04,259 --> 00:16:08,249
I mean the you know they say the probability of a is higher is you know I

264
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:10,979
probability of a is higher is you know I mean they you know would be exactly the

265
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:14,150
mean they you know would be exactly the opposite effect from the first example

266
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:20,489
opposite effect from the first example okay so so this is the motion again so

267
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:22,139
okay so so this is the motion again so we're gonna verse here you know I'm

268
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:26,879
we're gonna verse here you know I'm writing this is a standard are gonna

269
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,229
writing this is a standard are gonna spend actually two or three lectures

270
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:32,970
spend actually two or three lectures discussing about this kindle market or

271
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,039
discussing about this kindle market or in the State Park Estate state-space

272
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,569
in the State Park Estate state-space models but this is a Markov chain so we

273
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:43,439
models but this is a Markov chain so we can imagine you know you have some state

274
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:46,829
can imagine you know you have some state body moves but and you know the values

275
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:48,240
body moves but and you know the values of it

276
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,650
of it Connie so x1 is the volume of dynomonics

277
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:57,570
Connie so x1 is the volume of dynomonics - thank you it cetera so the unusually a

278
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:01,050
- thank you it cetera so the unusually a monomial assumption here where the model

279
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,760
monomial assumption here where the model effects of high BP depends only on the

280
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,030
effects of high BP depends only on the value of I'm XT minus 1 so prepared this

281
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,120
value of I'm XT minus 1 so prepared this expression show expecially we can

282
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,800
expression show expecially we can remember this pretty does this long

283
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:16,500
remember this pretty does this long expression compared list right with this

284
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,980
expression compared list right with this Markovian model that is very simplified

285
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,670
Markovian model that is very simplified because extra doesn't depend on XT minus

286
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:32,340
because extra doesn't depend on XT minus 2 XT minus 3 etc ok so this is this

287
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,500
2 XT minus 3 etc ok so this is this moment they see various cues the

288
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,080
moment they see various cues the independence relations in particular but

289
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:44,280
independence relations in particular but XP is independent X 2 minus 1 is in the

290
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,200
XP is independent X 2 minus 1 is in the parent of all the various values XT

291
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:58,070
parent of all the various values XT minus 2 X 1 on this course or something

292
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,950
minus 2 X 1 on this course or something if I highlighted from lecture 1 which is

293
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,230
if I highlighted from lecture 1 which is the parent of the node right so in this

294
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,540
the parent of the node right so in this case if we look at no business to

295
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:17,090
case if we look at no business to parents okay and so here's a fundamental

296
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:17,100


297
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,820
fairness conditionally previous relations for this directed graph and so

298
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,930
relations for this directed graph and so what it says x-ray is independent from

299
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,350
what it says x-ray is independent from the main the segments of a negative

300
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:36,020
the main the segments of a negative spiral so this is out there

301
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,760
spiral so this is out there Tamara trenched to emphasize the

302
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,010
Tamara trenched to emphasize the depositor given this will highlight in

303
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,270
depositor given this will highlight in that movie

304
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,680
that movie alright so

305
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,410
alright so the parlance it stays that the value of

306
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,660
the parlance it stays that the value of V is independent through the name of the

307
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,920
V is independent through the name of the sender so photographer at the political

308
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,540
sender so photographer at the political order the wrong descendants will have

309
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,860
order the wrong descendants will have numbers but they are basically

310
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,820
numbers but they are basically everything about the values of the

311
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,360
everything about the values of the parents basically in the order okay

312
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,300
parents basically in the order okay these are the non descendants right so

313
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,420
these are the non descendants right so point on the values of the parents

314
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,210
point on the values of the parents excuse you the fella from the

315
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,500
excuse you the fella from the non-descendants eye or anything like

316
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,230
non-descendants eye or anything like that right so view at this point I just

317
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,230
that right so view at this point I just want you to visualize as to what this

318
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,090
want you to visualize as to what this means because we love I think we should

319
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,530
means because we love I think we should highlight that which is not very

320
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,260
highlight that which is not very difficult but once you have this the

321
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,510
difficult but once you have this the composition for probability defined on

322
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,670
composition for probability defined on this graph you move rains pushing too

323
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,980
this graph you move rains pushing too hard okay so we will able to take

324
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,080
hard okay so we will able to take advantage of this relation so and no

325
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,430
advantage of this relation so and no Pascal will ensure that only

326
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,140
Pascal will ensure that only distillation of the fertilizer in this

327
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:52,750
distillation of the fertilizer in this graph satisfies this relation and around

328
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,790
graph satisfies this relation and around this dilution on the graph this relation

329
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,560
this dilution on the graph this relation is also satisfied you know I mean you

330
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,050
is also satisfied you know I mean you can see sorry

331
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:10,950
can see sorry alright so both ways this will be okay

332
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960


333
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:18,340
that the capitalization of the joint of immunity on the restive graph is written

334
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,100
immunity on the restive graph is written as the product over all the nodes of the

335
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,470
as the product over all the nodes of the graph of the conditional probabilities

336
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,490
graph of the conditional probabilities of X I excite the volume of you know the

337
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,600
of X I excite the volume of you know the I given the violence apart this is an

338
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,250
I given the violence apart this is an amazing between position if you think

339
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,070
amazing between position if you think about it right so you know

340
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,590
about it right so you know in this case the conditional probability

341
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:42,220
in this case the conditional probability corresponding to its no and this

342
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,870
corresponding to its no and this function is the condition of the way the

343
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:48,070
function is the condition of the way the effects are given its forests so mr.

344
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,529
effects are given its forests so mr. Bastian that factorization with this

345
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:52,930
Bastian that factorization with this graph the personal missile dependent

346
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,639
graph the personal missile dependent relation that we introduced which is

347
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:57,159
relation that we introduced which is certified ethical justification for

348
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:03,220
certified ethical justification for deewana and discuss its Lewis okay so I

349
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,470
deewana and discuss its Lewis okay so I will have exactly tricentennial examples

350
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,029
will have exactly tricentennial examples and some a little bit more complicated

351
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:14,049
and some a little bit more complicated but I'll ask you to know mrs. Blaine and

352
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:16,659
but I'll ask you to know mrs. Blaine and electric artworks and washing us if we

353
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:20,200
electric artworks and washing us if we can prove it

354
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,210


355
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:28,379
[Music]

356
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:28,389


357
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:34,629
Rises and this factors here these functions are the condition for

358
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:40,060
functions are the condition for committees of X i given sparks when we

359
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,370
committees of X i given sparks when we have this complicated factorization from

360
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,440
have this complicated factorization from the product rule well we only have the

361
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,409
the product rule well we only have the parents we have taught the settlers and

362
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:50,529
parents we have taught the settlers and the co parents and the novice and

363
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:52,810
the co parents and the novice and everything else is coming here but

364
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,870
everything else is coming here but because of this independent relationship

365
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,720
because of this independent relationship the the only partition here this X i

366
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:09,560
the the only partition here this X i given the parents of

367
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:09,570


368
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:17,180
so I'm actually so sure what I'm doing I am taking a directed graph with my body

369
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,899
am taking a directed graph with my body moves the first equation writes the the

370
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:23,180
moves the first equation writes the the product rule so no independence

371
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,549
product rule so no independence assumptions I am love assuming nothing

372
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:28,519
assumptions I am love assuming nothing and then I am applying sort of this

373
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:31,430
and then I am applying sort of this equation right I'm applying this

374
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,159
equation right I'm applying this equation that says that business

375
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,440
equation that says that business innovation is factorized this way and

376
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,539
innovation is factorized this way and another thing at this the predominate

377
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:40,219
another thing at this the predominate affects one because it's one has no

378
00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:42,649
affects one because it's one has no parents all right the prevent effects

379
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,839
parents all right the prevent effects still given x1 that's the only part I

380
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:48,169
still given x1 that's the only part I could still get enough only x1 x4 given

381
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:51,469
could still get enough only x1 x4 given 2 and 3 and X 5 given 3 so remember you

382
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:57,190
2 and 3 and X 5 given 3 so remember you can see the appearance relations that

383
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,200


384
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,779
effectively whether says the probability is equal to naught which means the level

385
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:07,519
is equal to naught which means the level x3 expires in the penitent water I mean

386
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,129
x3 expires in the penitent water I mean looking at this 2 equation there never

387
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:10,999
looking at this 2 equation there never expiry

388
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:15,710
expiry x5 is independent off that's 124 right

389
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,310
x5 is independent off that's 124 right there it's here given x2 x3 x4 is

390
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,789
there it's here given x2 x3 x4 is independent of X 1 given X 1 X 3 in

391
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:34,219
independent of X 1 given X 1 X 3 in terms of X 2 etc you may say I know but

392
00:23:34,219 --> 00:23:37,909
terms of X 2 etc you may say I know but how do I know this independence relation

393
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:39,889
how do I know this independence relation well we will spend a lecture or two and

394
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:49,610
well we will spend a lecture or two and we will

395
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:49,620


396
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:57,410
cases

397
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:57,420


398
00:23:57,420 --> 00:25:28,410
it's okay you know this if let's say is the number of parents to the power left

399
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:33,310
the number of parents to the power left to describe this times times

400
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:33,320


401
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:40,639
in principle actually somebody can say take the power a plus one

402
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:40,649
take the power a plus one

403
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:46,879
you sit up but you know it's like if you're comfortable a normalization and

404
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,320
you're comfortable a normalization and everything so that's approximately of

405
00:25:48,320 --> 00:26:00,399
everything so that's approximately of the order wine is take aid to affect

406
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:00,409


407
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:06,829
reverse right these are going to take a values and we're taking K values all

408
00:26:06,829 --> 00:27:26,430
values and we're taking K values all right so okay less rough

409
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:26,440


410
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,630
yes NZ's enemy remembrances lesser dismissed

411
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,320
dismissed mara independence relations okay and

412
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,030
mara independence relations okay and this is not very interesting so this is

413
00:27:36,030 --> 00:28:54,980
this is not very interesting so this is something very just the Ascension this

414
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,500
something very just the Ascension this you can appreciate the necessary I'm

415
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,780
you can appreciate the necessary I'm showing that this function is a

416
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:06,690
showing that this function is a probability right because you say 116

417
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:15,090
probability right because you say 116 points along that mystical did you okay

418
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:15,100


419
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:38,549
the distributions okay next one to experience equal to one which is nice

420
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:41,039
experience equal to one which is nice so obviously it's individual on

421
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,019
so obviously it's individual on normalizing expect that this will be the

422
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:48,539
normalizing expect that this will be the case and apparently this the composition

423
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:52,379
case and apparently this the composition here you can show that the national

424
00:29:52,379 --> 00:30:08,279
here you can show that the national experience is actually it comes home

425
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,259
experience is actually it comes home service functions is really the

426
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:13,619
service functions is really the conditional distribution which is what I

427
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:22,710
conditional distribution which is what I tell you you need to remember okay this

428
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,049
tell you you need to remember okay this functions are very more general and they

429
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:26,519
functions are very more general and they don't even have to be preferable if this

430
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:28,680
don't even have to be preferable if this but right now from directed graphs this

431
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,570
but right now from directed graphs this is the case and I say the proof and it

432
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,119
is the case and I say the proof and it works on extremely busy slide all right

433
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,740
works on extremely busy slide all right that's why I want you to type your

434
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,539
that's why I want you to type your homework because this rule was the lazy

435
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:45,779
homework because this rule was the lazy person typing the slide my secretary the

436
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,930
person typing the slide my secretary the novelist which imaginary person alright

437
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:54,659
novelist which imaginary person alright so it was me okay because I can't

438
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:56,310
so it was me okay because I can't imagine asking anybody that I've

439
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,710
imagine asking anybody that I've destroyed so it was this I want you to

440
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:06,680
destroyed so it was this I want you to to need some type and by typing fails so

441
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:06,690


442
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:11,549
that because you will need to do this for specific distribution your homework

443
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:16,649
for specific distribution your homework to do things like that so the first part

444
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:21,269
to do things like that so the first part of the theorem was methods and responses

445
00:31:21,269 --> 00:32:13,550
of the theorem was methods and responses individually

446
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:13,560


447
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:25,399
[Music]

448
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:25,409


449
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:38,310
the secrets wirelessly was one of the signals along okay sort of calculation

450
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,110
signals along okay sort of calculation that is going to make the relations of

451
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,090
that is going to make the relations of the article of all those extremely

452
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:51,600
the article of all those extremely efficient okay define in terms of the

453
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,310
efficient okay define in terms of the notes and the values of the parents

454
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,529
notes and the values of the parents minds within the operations rather in

455
00:32:55,529 --> 00:32:58,680
minds within the operations rather in this case the marginalization is a local

456
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,710
this case the marginalization is a local operation right and this allows us to to

457
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:06,070
operation right and this allows us to to see immediately the distance

458
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,080


459
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:52,730
it's his Michigan the normalized properly okay okay mr. as I say those

460
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,410
properly okay okay mr. as I say those any functions like that take the

461
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,590
any functions like that take the permanent zone distribution well I'm

462
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,330
permanent zone distribution well I'm going to show you know that this and

463
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,030
going to show you know that this and some of the various I write lists as the

464
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,450
some of the various I write lists as the joint effects k plus 1 and the quality k

465
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,760
joint effects k plus 1 and the quality k plus 1 divided by the powers of k plus 1

466
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,770
plus 1 divided by the powers of k plus 1 and then I I calculate the numerator

467
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:19,000
and then I I calculate the numerator denominator using the appropriate

468
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,409
denominator using the appropriate marginalization of the composition of

469
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:35,830
marginalization of the composition of the joint of a new distribution

470
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:35,840


471
00:34:35,840 --> 00:35:13,680
expansion sure whatever done

472
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:13,690


473
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:54,700
okay okay okay so this is the okay mr. Lucius okay because that's positive

474
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,950
Lucius okay because that's positive wearing dark shirt and whatever else on

475
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:06,640
wearing dark shirt and whatever else on the proctors so let's take this one and

476
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:21,540
the proctors so let's take this one and the partnership give you some k plus and

477
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:21,550


478
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:26,890
and because I have to forensic aware that if L doesn't create the pilots of k

479
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,570
that if L doesn't create the pilots of k plus 1 is inside before camp yesterday

480
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,760
plus 1 is inside before camp yesterday right so I don't have to worry about the

481
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,320
right so I don't have to worry about the parent and mr. McCann needed to learn

482
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,540
parent and mr. McCann needed to learn outside the estimation because I don't

483
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,600
outside the estimation because I don't samel XK plus one or departments and you

484
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,180
samel XK plus one or departments and you notice from here to there I have to

485
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,510
notice from here to there I have to sound and the professionals from 1 to K

486
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,490
sound and the professionals from 1 to K except the parts of campus where

487
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,160
except the parts of campus where elements will be possible

488
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:58,200
elements will be possible explain right there without a freshwater

489
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,210


490
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:02,860
because this is something extremely important right because I'm doing I'm

491
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,830
important right because I'm doing I'm pushing the summations inside I have a

492
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:09,510
pushing the summations inside I have a context that the potentials are okay

493
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,980
context that the potentials are okay according to my induction argument

494
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,420
according to my induction argument they're really the conditional

495
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,370
they're really the conditional distributions and then I have this

496
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,870
distributions and then I have this summation of the other factors that have

497
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:22,480
summation of the other factors that have no clear benefit so if you do this and

498
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,810
no clear benefit so if you do this and we move this on the local what you have

499
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,720
we move this on the local what you have to summon XK plus 1 because there's no X

500
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,690
to summon XK plus 1 because there's no X 2 plus 1 so this whole transformation

501
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:34,300
2 plus 1 so this whole transformation constants numerator denominator D

502
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,740
constants numerator denominator D summation constants and this

503
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,110
summation constants and this factorization by definition is 1 because

504
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,450
factorization by definition is 1 because this functions are normalized so what I

505
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,970
this functions are normalized so what I get is this conditional distribution is

506
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:53,430
get is this conditional distribution is equal to my factor FK plus 1 so as you

507
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:53,440


508
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:02,170
compose in revenue distribution in terms of conditionals the proof is not

509
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,390
of conditionals the proof is not shortened to contagious is like traffic

510
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,080
shortened to contagious is like traffic AIDS

511
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,860
AIDS ok actually most books the parties

512
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,980
ok actually most books the parties consider a logician there's no proof

513
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:17,490
consider a logician there's no proof okay inaudible any questions on this

514
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,980
okay inaudible any questions on this thing's right if another story

515
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,200
thing's right if another story our interest is really the decomposition

516
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,460
our interest is really the decomposition in terms of these local conscious that

517
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,310
in terms of these local conscious that their conditional the values of exodus

518
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,560
their conditional the values of exodus 12 given its parents the resumption

519
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,110
12 given its parents the resumption topology will here the destructor

520
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,390
topology will here the destructor fundamental to the type of things we do

521
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,240
fundamental to the type of things we do this with directed graph and the part

522
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,330
this with directed graph and the part that we have it illogical or derivative

523
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,520
that we have it illogical or derivative is decelerations and insulation

524
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,840
is decelerations and insulation don't imagine that they have to sound x1

525
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,250
don't imagine that they have to sound x1 an actual appears in all of these

526
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,260
an actual appears in all of these functions

527
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,270


528
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:59,630
myself but the tractor fixed islands only on the bottom here exclusively

529
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,850
only on the bottom here exclusively there right so obviously in this

530
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:04,190
there right so obviously in this problems you can start some you provide

531
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,810
problems you can start some you provide to the left all right

532
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,760
to the left all right and if examples as you see this so

533
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,190
and if examples as you see this so that's important and then you'll notice

534
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,380
that's important and then you'll notice you have some operations to put rods and

535
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,500
you have some operations to put rods and notes where we sum up although the rest

536
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,470
notes where we sum up although the rest of the body most this is so focused on

537
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,380
of the body most this is so focused on the operation we we have to do with a

538
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,330
the operation we we have to do with a glass with left of model stressing the

539
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:37,310
glass with left of model stressing the context of why not kids like the

540
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,440
context of why not kids like the different there is a problem to the

541
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,300
different there is a problem to the complex all right I'm

542
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,960
complex all right I'm I always like the opposite of the normal

543
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,080
I always like the opposite of the normal case right I remember you know I said

544
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,330
case right I remember you know I said maybe this joke some time ago I was

545
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,610
maybe this joke some time ago I was trying to give a whole action on some

546
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:56,390
trying to give a whole action on some topic and some people ask me can you

547
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,240
topic and some people ask me can you start to give an example and I have not

548
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,570
start to give an example and I have not been introduced what the topic was

549
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:05,420
been introduced what the topic was okay you know she'll never leave my case

550
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,130
okay you know she'll never leave my case alive to give you the period when the

551
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,410
alive to give you the period when the examples come later on he do the

552
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:13,040
examples come later on he do the examples on your own so yes sort of the

553
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,030
examples on your own so yes sort of the people in one day so extra depends on X

554
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:29,780
people in one day so extra depends on X 1 X 2 X 2 etc so you can see I say okay

555
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,310
1 X 2 X 2 etc so you can see I say okay of the write this as a product of the

556
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,460
of the write this as a product of the functions but intellectual inspires this

557
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,130
functions but intellectual inspires this is nothing then experian the partner

558
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,570
is nothing then experian the partner physics wonder next year and the

559
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,430
physics wonder next year and the pharmacist our experience it's for the

560
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,890
pharmacist our experience it's for the next three so the other ones you can

561
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,920
next three so the other ones you can show you at least the service functions

562
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,680
show you at least the service functions they are nothing else or the the

563
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,290
they are nothing else or the the function of P of X clinics still is when

564
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:55,550
function of P of X clinics still is when the condition of x3 given x2 and

565
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:59,590
the condition of x3 given x2 and I think mr. composition right and I I

566
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:05,270
I think mr. composition right and I I you know the country first I have to

567
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,610
you know the country first I have to calculate the joint if X to X T divided

568
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,940
calculate the joint if X to X T divided by T FX still so then the other thing I

569
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,430
by T FX still so then the other thing I have to some obviously to marginalize

570
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:20,570
have to some obviously to marginalize it's all X 1 X 2 X 4 or X 1 and X 4 and

571
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,670
it's all X 1 X 2 X 4 or X 1 and X 4 and you can see some of the things we'll

572
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,740
you can see some of the things we'll organization can see long distance

573
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,520
organization can see long distance inside the trial and these parenthesis

574
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,320
inside the trial and these parenthesis and visible practice comes too long to

575
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,530
and visible practice comes too long to learn good idea to is f 3 or X 3 and X 3

576
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,710
learn good idea to is f 3 or X 3 and X 3 just is like a turbulent completed

577
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,670
just is like a turbulent completed version of the theorem

578
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:43,610
version of the theorem okay the best possible functions right

579
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,950
okay the best possible functions right and this conscience turn out to be pro

580
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,050
and this conscience turn out to be pro communities is only for directed graphs

581
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,960
communities is only for directed graphs we said anything for undirected graphs

582
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,100
we said anything for undirected graphs the case to be very well general

583
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,990
the case to be very well general management of sanity can position at

584
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,450
management of sanity can position at least in the context of this Markov

585
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,990
least in the context of this Markov chain about adoption being a bit more

586
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:12,860
chain about adoption being a bit more powerful so this is an example from one

587
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,310
powerful so this is an example from one of the textbook similar in machine

588
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:25,910
of the textbook similar in machine learning so one of the notes is the

589
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,940
learning so one of the notes is the glass is left one of the knowledge is

590
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,460
glass is left one of the knowledge is the support which can be on the left the

591
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,920
the support which can be on the left the other one is a know that is raining

592
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,330
other one is a know that is raining which can be on earth

593
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:39,140
which can be on earth and everyone is that it's cloudy

594
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,010
and everyone is that it's cloudy I am a strong basically the dependencies

595
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:46,310
I am a strong basically the dependencies look like the hot all right and let's

596
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,040
look like the hot all right and let's follow the fuel that I described the

597
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,430
follow the fuel that I described the junket ability of drama straight away

598
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:56,800
junket ability of drama straight away the grass right is basically returnest

599
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,730
the grass right is basically returnest same time

600
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:02,270
same time first even see we're forgiven see what

601
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,090
first even see we're forgiven see what not really given us an hour and

602
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,600
not really given us an hour and everything you can see by comparing this

603
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,540
everything you can see by comparing this with examining the composition using the

604
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,700
with examining the composition using the product community to share is implies

605
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,600
product community to share is implies basically fundamental national

606
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:22,100
basically fundamental national independence relations right and as a

607
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:43,250
independence relations right and as a measure of the elections okay right that

608
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,140
measure of the elections okay right that you can this you can expect this

609
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,530
you can this you can expect this independence relations all right and

610
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,260
independence relations all right and then from this you can say oh that's why

611
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:56,240
then from this you can say oh that's why the composition I mean in Pascal the new

612
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,030
the composition I mean in Pascal the new activist problem and you have this graph

613
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,770
activist problem and you have this graph like that smells you already have a

614
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:03,170
like that smells you already have a negative in the graphics independence

615
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:05,180
negative in the graphics independence relations so this decomposition is

616
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,560
relations so this decomposition is automatic you don't have to clear

617
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:18,680
automatic you don't have to clear anything right so we are going to define

618
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:26,240
anything right so we are going to define this distribution so effectively the

619
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,390
this distribution so effectively the trial value well because of an

620
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:34,910
trial value well because of an organization to define this is from his

621
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:37,490
organization to define this is from his first loudest row so if I do he wanted

622
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,440
first loudest row so if I do he wanted as long as the other one is one line is

623
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,340
as long as the other one is one line is nervously than one value let's say this

624
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:46,190
nervously than one value let's say this is the probability of the specular the

625
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:49,280
is the probability of the specular the hell are they so I am writing is

626
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,430
hell are they so I am writing is probability well the cloud is a false

627
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,230
probability well the cloud is a false argument or a tool

628
00:44:55,230 --> 00:45:01,680
argument or a tool to describe this well actually I have no

629
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,570
to describe this well actually I have no money from this I have to fill this I

630
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,850
money from this I have to fill this I have different Lee's and if I take this

631
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:13,530
have different Lee's and if I take this little mini be how isn't it okay we come

632
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,270
little mini be how isn't it okay we come from the normalization because for a lot

633
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:17,310
from the normalization because for a lot of skilled problem it doesn't make a

634
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,530
of skilled problem it doesn't make a sense to say - wah - wah

635
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:22,530
sense to say - wah - wah yeah we can subtract - fish - a problem

636
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:23,970
yeah we can subtract - fish - a problem with million borrowers we will make a

637
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:24,600
with million borrowers we will make a difference

638
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:30,859
difference okay so no bother so I spent the card

639
00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:35,430
okay so no bother so I spent the card for this problem is the times to the

640
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:38,520
for this problem is the times to the carry case the number of points below

641
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:42,420
carry case the number of points below and this environment variables that's

642
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,690
and this environment variables that's why you see it through there

643
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:49,770
why you see it through there actually I don't know why I different

644
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,230
actually I don't know why I different from before before using were using K

645
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,670
from before before using were using K from the number of values that are

646
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,190
from the number of values that are available can take here I just a for

647
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:59,130
available can take here I just a for another opponent the game you guys are

648
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:02,010
another opponent the game you guys are adult and vaccinated so you can figure

649
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,440
adult and vaccinated so you can figure out in which life what the context is

650
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,480
out in which life what the context is right so so I don't have to go back and

651
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:13,680
right so so I don't have to go back and change the story that's already there

652
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,130
change the story that's already there and I was sure that everybody responds

653
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:19,890
and I was sure that everybody responds what this equation makes or let's the

654
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:24,270
what this equation makes or let's the the correlation rate across today from

655
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,670
the correlation rate across today from directly ghost makes a little sense

656
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:38,710
directly ghost makes a little sense there was nothing else okay all right

657
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:38,720


658
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:47,040
so this 11 example I think I'm gonna I may have to give this because there's

659
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:47,050


660
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:50,980
unpleasant dependence relations from this example as applications in the

661
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:57,960
this example as applications in the slides so this is prevalence of you know

662
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,250
slides so this is prevalence of you know to come you know sometime in the near

663
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:06,040
to come you know sometime in the near part of a future so there are such

664
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,800
part of a future so there are such variables and best on with the

665
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,809
variables and best on with the discussion of in the composition this is

666
00:47:10,809 --> 00:47:14,470
discussion of in the composition this is what I have right x1 x2 given x1 x3

667
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:19,030
what I have right x1 x2 given x1 x3 given X 1 X 5 etc X tix given X 2 X 5

668
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:23,410
given X 1 X 5 etc X tix given X 2 X 5 protected right and and you say in this

669
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,530
protected right and and you say in this example a nice graphical representation

670
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:29,859
example a nice graphical representation of the table society to this conditional

671
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:31,240
of the table society to this conditional distribution is corresponding to each

672
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,839
distribution is corresponding to each tsunami so x1 it's a long experience

673
00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:37,210
tsunami so x1 it's a long experience given x1 so it's a baby like this

674
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:39,520
given x1 so it's a baby like this exports given x2 table like this exist

675
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,460
exports given x2 table like this exist given two values okay it's a table like

676
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,870
given two values okay it's a table like that and like that I have to actually

677
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:50,050
that and like that I have to actually program I'm assuming and I'm saying this

678
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:53,430
program I'm assuming and I'm saying this that show the kid and take note and

679
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,599
that show the kid and take note and destroy that we assign you some homework

680
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,670
destroy that we assign you some homework problems when we don't do the question

681
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,140
problems when we don't do the question all right you have something only

682
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:05,730
all right you have something only computer program to do this for you

683
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:05,740


684
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:13,920
don't eat this don't eat this already did this Antoni gaudí

685
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:13,930


686
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:16,980
okay guys there's a time for them how's that possible

687
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:23,250
that possible I don't have the power you know why not

688
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:27,530
I don't have the power you know why not a very good machine ever left of their

689
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:30,030
a very good machine ever left of their other thing you guys left me because

690
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:35,100
other thing you guys left me because you'll never never go almost papers

691
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:40,440
you'll never never go almost papers right that's the 30 minutes all right

692
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,700
right that's the 30 minutes all right let's see necessarily put so I'm going

693
00:48:44,700 --> 00:49:00,360
let's see necessarily put so I'm going to my past

694
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:00,370


695
00:49:00,370 --> 00:50:10,390
and okay so which of the sexist is coming all right so then this is our

696
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:12,970
coming all right so then this is our independent of each other and that's the

697
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:18,540
independent of each other and that's the concept of the latest Paris fire okay so

698
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,270
concept of the latest Paris fire okay so so it's my NRI all right this are

699
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,490
so it's my NRI all right this are independent if I didn't know why they're

700
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:27,640
independent if I didn't know why they're nervous values of X 1 and X 4 whatever I

701
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,070
nervous values of X 1 and X 4 whatever I get they depend on each other this is

702
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,660
get they depend on each other this is sort of a song another problem will

703
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,540
sort of a song another problem will reduce you know in in sort of mixed

704
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,940
reduce you know in in sort of mixed models but many other settings as well

705
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:41,819
models but many other settings as well okay

706
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:41,829


707
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:46,979
two things - one and two long is this Belgium to mislead Gaussian so if I

708
00:50:46,979 --> 00:50:48,829
Belgium to mislead Gaussian so if I wrote a little bit of white for it sex

709
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:53,609
wrote a little bit of white for it sex the this exercising defendant and so

710
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:56,969
the this exercising defendant and so effectively you know this is the problem

711
00:50:56,969 --> 00:50:58,829
effectively you know this is the problem engine roaring tons of the divinity of

712
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:02,039
engine roaring tons of the divinity of the world X given Y and the lamented

713
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:04,079
the world X given Y and the lamented world X living who soldier sex is given

714
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,469
world X living who soldier sex is given Y can be factorized over the data right

715
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:10,680
Y can be factorized over the data right because of this assumption that the X is

716
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:15,209
because of this assumption that the X is having a fairly given Y ok so so this is

717
00:51:15,209 --> 00:51:16,910
having a fairly given Y ok so so this is something very important

718
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:19,259
something very important laughter moment of birth under the name

719
00:51:19,259 --> 00:51:22,979
laughter moment of birth under the name of naive Bayes classifier i mean i

720
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:29,089
of naive Bayes classifier i mean i satisfy a fear you know i know this but

721
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:35,699
satisfy a fear you know i know this but additionally basically has been this is

722
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:38,039
additionally basically has been this is that that's fine to say become from now

723
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:40,499
that that's fine to say become from now someone and thousand through so that's

724
00:51:40,499 --> 00:51:47,150
someone and thousand through so that's what the name plus pi or take this

725
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:49,799
what the name plus pi or take this complexed and say the sections are

726
00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:52,199
complexed and say the sections are linearly independent given y and you

727
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:55,799
linearly independent given y and you notice on this paragraph if you see on

728
00:51:55,799 --> 00:51:57,120
notice on this paragraph if you see on the birthday all right

729
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,880
the birthday all right I started fatal dependencies between the

730
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,900
I started fatal dependencies between the exes okay so this is the display the

731
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:09,269
exes okay so this is the display the printed my Vegas was fired okay to come

732
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:12,359
printed my Vegas was fired okay to come up with your own little algorithms and

733
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:17,279
up with your own little algorithms and this if you search in the literature you

734
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,709
this if you search in the literature you will find very particular algorithm it's

735
00:52:19,709 --> 00:52:22,890
will find very particular algorithm it's for leveling this demented name they

736
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:27,839
for leveling this demented name they discussed fire okay yes well I just know

737
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,999
discussed fire okay yes well I just know if you remember that name basements that

738
00:52:29,999 --> 00:52:31,680
if you remember that name basements that these types of sex

739
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,719
these types of sex running right and independent so you

740
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:35,819
running right and independent so you have a nice proposition that looks like

741
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,610
have a nice proposition that looks like this okay

742
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,590
this okay and constants with dependencies between

743
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:44,730
and constants with dependencies between the extras and because the balance is

744
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:47,040
the extras and because the balance is still maintained some pay structure that

745
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,630
still maintained some pay structure that you can do is the difference but the

746
00:52:51,630 --> 00:53:04,430
you can do is the difference but the custom what you see on the top okay

747
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:04,440


748
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:15,720
it's prevalent conditional independence relations National Defense relations so

749
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:23,250
relations National Defense relations so these actions right so this is all right

750
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,190
these actions right so this is all right this is the length of appearances this

751
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,860
this is the length of appearances this is referred directly best luck sir okay

752
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:33,810
is referred directly best luck sir okay and the party dependencies we have this

753
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,140
and the party dependencies we have this one we introduced the Vegas more longer

754
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,900
one we introduced the Vegas more longer in about two legs from now so you can

755
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,790
in about two legs from now so you can work from something from collective one

756
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:46,220
work from something from collective one connected personal between the first

757
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:46,230


758
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:57,700
okay there is nothing new there

759
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:57,710


760
00:53:57,710 --> 00:55:08,990
but I am descendants even the parents then the descendants even the parents

761
00:55:08,990 --> 00:56:13,360
then the descendants even the parents and

762
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:13,370


763
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:19,340
accept the fact the fundamental property of directed graphs the different

764
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:23,480
of directed graphs the different position from the parable sprouts to

765
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,760
position from the parable sprouts to convince your sensitive actually again

766
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,450
convince your sensitive actually again the fulfilled never step two is this

767
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:31,220
the fulfilled never step two is this marginalization that we did in two

768
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,520
marginalization that we did in two examples before and then you can treat

769
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:40,810
examples before and then you can treat this decomposition is correct

770
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:40,820


771
00:56:40,820 --> 00:57:57,530
[Music]

772
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:57,540


773
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:27,020
one extreme

774
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:27,030


775
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:34,280
experts in the time of x1 x2 and there's not wrong exterior to this efficient

776
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:34,290


777
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:40,319
right

778
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:40,329


779
00:58:40,329 --> 00:58:47,920
- okay listen tada your life is perfect when it's the

780
00:58:47,920 --> 00:59:00,430
your life is perfect when it's the expected by P of X 1 is 50 ok by you

781
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:03,370
expected by P of X 1 is 50 ok by you alpha plus X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 is that what

782
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:07,469
alpha plus X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 is that what happens to X 5 and X 6 fear of insulin

783
00:59:07,469 --> 00:59:11,729
happens to X 5 and X 6 fear of insulin what happened to X 5 minus X 6

784
00:59:11,729 --> 00:59:15,700
what happened to X 5 minus X 6 well I mean the question of attack the

785
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,469
well I mean the question of attack the black is words you know when you

786
00:59:17,469 --> 00:59:20,469
black is words you know when you somewhere X 5 and X 6 this is 0.1 of

787
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:24,400
somewhere X 5 and X 6 this is 0.1 of this equal to 1 so they disappear you

788
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,859
this equal to 1 so they disappear you see that when you analyze to the joint

789
00:59:26,859 --> 00:59:29,710
see that when you analyze to the joint the next 5 minutes because this how

790
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:32,319
the next 5 minutes because this how conditional distinguishes the summation

791
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:37,870
conditional distinguishes the summation is giving the advantage okay so so this

792
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:41,049
is giving the advantage okay so so this is the joint of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 and then

793
00:59:41,049 --> 00:59:42,700
is the joint of X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 and then if you wanted to join the pitch 1 X 2 X

794
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,620
if you wanted to join the pitch 1 X 2 X 3 we have to something that's clear but

795
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,719
3 we have to something that's clear but when someone experimenting disappearing

796
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:48,999
when someone experimenting disappearing because summation of expelling everyone

797
00:59:48,999 --> 00:59:50,170
because summation of expelling everyone all right

798
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,630
all right yeah well this consus without this

799
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,690
yeah well this consus without this concept evolved already but you get this

800
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:59,019
concept evolved already but you get this perfect score given X 2 okay so this is

801
00:59:59,019 --> 01:00:01,019
perfect score given X 2 okay so this is kinda filled this independence relation

802
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:05,519
kinda filled this independence relation but I wrestle to remember the ideas that

803
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,200
but I wrestle to remember the ideas that Assad isn't behind all of this and say

804
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,999
Assad isn't behind all of this and say all there is an independence relations

805
01:00:09,999 --> 01:00:12,940
all there is an independence relations but to heaven all the groups of this

806
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:15,489
but to heaven all the groups of this graph and he says this graph implies

807
01:00:15,489 --> 01:00:18,640
graph and he says this graph implies none of this independence relations

808
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,339
none of this independence relations so whatever distribution that population

809
01:00:21,339 --> 01:00:24,039
so whatever distribution that population the graph has been tamarkan satisfy of

810
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:25,769
the graph has been tamarkan satisfy of this relationship

811
01:00:25,769 --> 01:00:28,690
this relationship okay a stupid idea so we're not going to

812
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:31,870
okay a stupid idea so we're not going to do the algebra but we lived

813
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:34,300
do the algebra but we lived that vision server browser arguments

814
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:38,640
that vision server browser arguments implants University what is relationship

815
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:38,650


816
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:44,650
and here is an over in the Paris relation X 1 given X 6 is the head of X

817
01:00:44,650 --> 01:01:31,660
relation X 1 given X 6 is the head of X 3 X 3 this is like in the in this case

818
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:36,000
3 X 3 this is like in the in this case of disease that say cancer and why is

819
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,859
of disease that say cancer and why is somehow kind of a disease you know some

820
01:01:38,859 --> 01:01:43,990
somehow kind of a disease you know some of molecule blood or other things so why

821
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:46,720
of molecule blood or other things so why is the disease right but the memory

822
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,170
is the disease right but the memory access many diseases and you have

823
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:52,089
access many diseases and you have something that can be derived from any

824
01:01:52,089 --> 01:01:57,579
something that can be derived from any diseases so you can see this as a little

825
01:01:57,579 --> 01:02:02,740
diseases so you can see this as a little from X to Y so exist another thing the -

826
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:04,690
from X to Y so exist another thing the - you can see this is awareness problem

827
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:07,329
you can see this is awareness problem that if you have an alternate and let's

828
01:02:07,329 --> 01:02:08,770
that if you have an alternate and let's say a blood test you ask the members

829
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:12,670
say a blood test you ask the members area and so this graph that you see in

830
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:18,520
area and so this graph that you see in spitzer discuss you know this isn't

831
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,079
spitzer discuss you know this isn't about the narrative rondelle the joint

832
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:23,050
about the narrative rondelle the joint affection Y as the probable effects

833
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:27,010
affection Y as the probable effects knives the probability of Y given X so

834
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:30,400
knives the probability of Y given X so reliable addressed you know this you

835
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,620
reliable addressed you know this you know the parent effects may be will

836
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:36,280
know the parent effects may be will define it by

837
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:36,290


838
01:02:36,290 --> 01:03:49,460
right right okay

839
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:49,470

01:03:59,350 --> 01:03:59,360


842
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:04,640
delicious from X to Y but that doesn't allow you can be any friends res or

843
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,410
allow you can be any friends res or something for y and say what desserts

844
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:13,430
something for y and say what desserts okay

845
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:13,440


846
01:04:13,440 --> 01:06:17,520
they delivered the next two slides we will discuss and rain

847
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:17,530


848
01:06:17,530 --> 01:07:42,450
okay right okay so this is the right

849
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:42,460

dress is wet but let me let you know whether Dre

853

860
01:09:34,839 --> 01:09:39,329
this has already explained that the grass is wet

861
01:09:39,329 --> 01:09:44,320
grass is wet okay we will formally serve this with a

862
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:48,460
okay we will formally serve this with a derivation okay but in essence if this

863
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:57,990
derivation okay but in essence if this example all right

864
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:58,000


865
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:11,569
no problems maybe today

866
01:10:11,569 --> 01:10:11,579


867
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:17,990
with little names let's say you have two points the students are doing the kind

868
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:22,490
points the students are doing the kind of it thank you go gents you know come

869
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:24,200
of it thank you go gents you know come to get doesn't depend on anything so

870
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,089
to get doesn't depend on anything so they're putting the feather corns let's

871
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:51,010
they're putting the feather corns let's say this and this right so let's

872
01:10:51,010 --> 01:11:03,140
say this and this right so let's Alchemist is right this is zero okay so

873
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:07,910
Alchemist is right this is zero okay so this has exploratory they so right so

874
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:11,330
this has exploratory they so right so this is Center for the experiment a

875
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:16,640
this is Center for the experiment a phenomenal

876
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:16,650


877
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:23,330
I was reporting this in the slides you know losing the game in the

878
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:24,920
know losing the game in the factorization which we miss you can

879
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:28,940
factorization which we miss you can actually compute an audience and do the

880
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:31,460
actually compute an audience and do the algebra nothing Ranger so this is the

881
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,410
algebra nothing Ranger so this is the factorization we started so you can

882
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,900
factorization we started so you can actually prove all the questions that

883
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:56,239
actually prove all the questions that you saw in the previous slides

884
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:56,249


885
01:11:56,249 --> 01:12:02,839
my ass Douglas relation so let me just say what's going easier so remember we

886
01:12:02,839 --> 01:12:11,899
say what's going easier so remember we sent that you know X of the royal

887
01:12:11,899 --> 01:12:21,919
sent that you know X of the royal descendants okay so basically the board

888
01:12:21,919 --> 01:12:25,729
descendants okay so basically the board is independent of anything else okay the

889
01:12:25,729 --> 01:12:29,000
is independent of anything else okay the SAT score or what rate is clearing out

890
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,479
SAT score or what rate is clearing out that cetera

891
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:37,689
that cetera question on the doctor okay it says

892
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:37,699


893
01:12:37,699 --> 01:12:43,279
parasocial was given them the difficulty of an exam all right

894
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:45,770
of an exam all right it's also kind of hell okay that's not

895
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:50,410
it's also kind of hell okay that's not what I wrote it

896
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:50,420


897
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:57,480
however informational says about its descendants

898
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:57,490


899
01:12:57,490 --> 01:13:02,840
well so long I just want the sentence against not breathing with an equation

900
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:06,300
against not breathing with an equation any information about the descendants

901
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,270
any information about the descendants contains beliefs about this invention

902
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:12,360
contains beliefs about this invention reasoning process so another race if you

903
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,330
reasoning process so another race if you know what happened was still there it

904
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:17,190
know what happened was still there it has got there okay

905
01:13:17,190 --> 01:13:23,280
has got there okay it changes the picture okay even who

906
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,840
it changes the picture okay even who says the difficulty on the intelligence

907
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,630
says the difficulty on the intelligence of the Skinner right if the evidence is

908
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:29,310
of the Skinner right if the evidence is the difficulty of in Excel and even

909
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:34,980
the difficulty of in Excel and even peasants sugar still smells but the

910
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:37,890
peasants sugar still smells but the official from below the most immortality

911
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:40,790
official from below the most immortality do the fixer okay so we will see this

912
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:45,120
do the fixer okay so we will see this sort of problem when we discuss

913
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,010
sort of problem when we discuss independence relationships and and

914
01:13:47,010 --> 01:14:09,940
independence relationships and and evidence okay

915
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:09,950

926
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:22,190
and this would be the growth and the logo is this image on just the mission

927
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:24,720
logo is this image on just the mission we have sent up over all the she's

928
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:30,210
we have sent up over all the she's invaluable success okay so then this

929
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:31,830
invaluable success okay so then this have the visceral volume is the Sabbath

930
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:33,540
have the visceral volume is the Sabbath even vartanus and this is sort of the

931
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:36,270
even vartanus and this is sort of the main cost that allows you develop native

932
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:40,080
main cost that allows you develop native environments now the only thing I was

933
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:43,770
environments now the only thing I was gonna say is a little socially desirable

934
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:47,940
gonna say is a little socially desirable but Sir I was seven gardeners

935
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:50,070
but Sir I was seven gardeners there was the number of mobile growth so

936
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:53,600
there was the number of mobile growth so we can think of a gradual and that way

937
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,240
we can think of a gradual and that way the death of our decisions coming so the

938
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:00,300
the death of our decisions coming so the killer virus can be maybe indicator

939
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:05,550
killer virus can be maybe indicator punch values that tells you what it's

940
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:08,670
punch values that tells you what it's beautiful collect - what

941
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:11,100
beautiful collect - what Gaussian envelopes are they too late or

942
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:17,970
Gaussian envelopes are they too late or what you know okay so life is the

943
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:19,980
what you know okay so life is the composition is right that this hidden

944
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:22,260
composition is right that this hidden garden was the morning with a number of

945
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:25,410
garden was the morning with a number of the additional volume which in the graph

946
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:34,580
the additional volume which in the graph you can keep the prosperous

947
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:34,590


948
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:41,580
service parameters theta are independent but independent of the data you collect

949
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:45,180
but independent of the data you collect in the problem okay sure

950
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:47,490
in the problem okay sure and in real problems here in the

951
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:49,890
and in real problems here in the formation of the rebels will go to be

952
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:52,650
formation of the rebels will go to be able to achieve is a testament to this

953
01:16:52,650 --> 01:17:03,830
able to achieve is a testament to this data parameters theta but this bottom of

954
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:03,840


955
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:12,900
missions to carefully account for the factors and somehow instance you have to

956
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,030
factors and somehow instance you have to do predictions by information of the

957
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:40,260
do predictions by information of the students to know is nobody here in a few

958
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:42,420
students to know is nobody here in a few weeks from now but because not wait a

959
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:45,780
weeks from now but because not wait a minute and the very natural self

960
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:48,600
minute and the very natural self directly linked to my website at least

961
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,090
directly linked to my website at least the previous one and this nice already

962
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:55,760
the previous one and this nice already aware and I will see here on next

963
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,280
aware and I will see here on next Tuesday suppose
