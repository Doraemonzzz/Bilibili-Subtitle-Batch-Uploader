41
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,410
观察到的指数3 X 1和X 6是独立的，所以这
independent okay so this but the notation rates

42
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,360

变得等于1而不管外部是什么，所以这个和这个抵消了
distillation becomes equal to 1 regardless what

118
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,620
变得等于1而不管外部是什么，所以这个和这个抵消了
becomes equal to 1 regardless what exteriors so this and this cancel out so

119
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:54,630
变得等于1而不管外部是什么，所以这个和这个抵消了
exteriors so this and this cancel out so basically I'm sorry business and cancel

120
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,050
基本上我很抱歉，取消此等价等于1等于
exteriors so this and this cancel out so basically I'm sorry business and cancel

121
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,160
基本上我很抱歉，取消此等价等于1等于
basically I'm sorry business and cancel out this cut is equal to 1 this is equal

122
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,170
基本上我很抱歉，取消此等价等于1等于
out this cut is equal to 1 this is equal to 1 so basically this illustris allow

123
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,160
到1，所以基本上，这个illustris允许
out this cut is equal to 1 this is equal to 1 so basically this illustris allow

124
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,620
到1，所以基本上，这个illustris允许
to 1 so basically this illustris allow this

125
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:04,630
到1，所以基本上，这个illustris允许
you know it's one anyways so I get this big donation on the numerator which is

126
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:09,090
你知道那是一个，所以我在分子上得到了大笔捐款
you know it's one anyways so I get this big donation on the numerator which is

127
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,100
你知道那是一个，所以我在分子上得到了大笔捐款
big donation on the numerator which is this and then there's somebody pointed

128
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,270
这然后有人指向我，只是他们会他来见我，他
big donation on the numerator which is this and then there's somebody pointed

129
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,730
这然后有人指向我，只是他们会他来见我，他
this and then there's somebody pointed me just they would he came to see me he

130
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:14,740
这然后有人指向我，只是他们会他来见我，他
me just they would he came to see me he says to me why is this equal to laughs

131
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,350
对我说为什么这等于笑，因为你突然发现我插上电源
me just they would he came to see me he says to me why is this equal to laughs

132
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,400
对我说为什么这等于笑，因为你突然发现我插上电源
says to me why is this equal to laughs because you notice suddenly I plug in

133
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,410
对我说为什么这等于笑，因为你突然发现我插上电源
because you notice suddenly I plug in Ian's in addition to extreme x2 and in

134
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,650
Ian除了极限x2和额外的x5外，我还插入了
because you notice suddenly I plug in Ian's in addition to extreme x2 and in

135
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,960
Ian除了极限x2和额外的x5外，我还插入了
Ian's in addition to extreme x2 and in addition to extra x5 I plug in an

136
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:24,970
Ian除了极限x2和额外的x5外，我还插入了
addition to extra x5 I plug in an extreme white house

137
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,720
极端的白宫
addition to extra x5 I plug in an extreme white house

138
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,560
所以在这里，我有X 5给定X 3 X 5给定X 3，然后我可以，但这等于
addition to extra x5 I plug in an extreme white house

139
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:35,570
所以在这里，我有X 5给定X 3 X 5给定X 3，然后我可以，但这等于


140
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:42,370
所以在这里，我有X 5给定X 3 X 5给定X 3，然后我可以，但这等于
so here I have X 5 given X 3 X 5 given X 3 and then I could but this is equal to

141
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:42,380
所以在这里，我有X 5给定X 3 X 5给定X 3，然后我可以，但这等于
3 and then I could but this is equal to X 5 and X 3 and X 2 what property from

142
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:48,430
X 5和X 3和X 2从我们说的父母那里得到什么财产，不，我没有看到
3 and then I could but this is equal to X 5 and X 3 and X 2 what property from

143
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:54,580
X 5和X 3和X 2从我们说的父母那里得到什么财产，不，我没有看到
X 5 and X 3 and X 2 what property from the ones we say parent no I don't see a

144
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:54,590
X 5和X 3和X 2从我们说的父母那里得到什么财产，不，我没有看到
the ones we say parent no I don't see a parent X 2 is not the power

145
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,990
父X 2不是力量
the ones we say parent no I don't see a parent X 2 is not the power

146
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,050
是的，但是我们所说的基本独立属性之一
the ones we say parent no I don't see a parent X 2 is not the power

147
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,060
是的，但是我们所说的基本独立属性之一


148
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,280
是的，但是我们所说的基本独立属性之一
yeah but one of the fundamental independent properties that we stated

149
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,290
是的，但是我们所说的基本独立属性之一
independent properties that we stated and we will see three times today or

150
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,340
我们今天将看到三遍，或者四遍是给定父节点的节点
independent properties that we stated and we will see three times today or

151
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:16,550
我们今天将看到三遍，或者四遍是给定父节点的节点
and we will see three times today or four is the given the parent the node is

152
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
我们今天将看到三遍，或者四遍是给定父节点的节点
four is the given the parent the node is independent of of the non-descendants

153
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,260
再次独立于非后裔，不公正的无后裔
four is the given the parent the node is independent of of the non-descendants

154
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,490
再次独立于非后裔，不公正的无后裔
independent of of the non-descendants again the no descendants of the unjust

155
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:23,500
再次独立于非后裔，不公正的无后裔
again the no descendants of the unjust was basically plus some extra notes okay

156
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,190
基本上加上一些额外的注释就可以了，所以在这种情况下X 2不是祖先
again the no descendants of the unjust was basically plus some extra notes okay

157
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:33,240
基本上加上一些额外的注释就可以了，所以在这种情况下X 2不是祖先
was basically plus some extra notes okay so in this case X 2 is not an ancestor

158
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,250
基本上加上一些额外的注释就可以了，所以在这种情况下X 2不是祖先
so in this case X 2 is not an ancestor is a lone dissenter because the only

159
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,690
是唯一的异议者，因为X 5的唯一访问权是X 3和X 1 all
so in this case X 2 is not an ancestor is a lone dissenter because the only

160
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:43,440
是唯一的异议者，因为X 5的唯一访问权是X 3和X 1 all
is a lone dissenter because the only access third of X 5 is X 3 and X 1 all

161
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:43,450
是唯一的异议者，因为X 5的唯一访问权是X 3和X 1 all
access third of X 5 is X 3 and X 1 all right

162
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:43,860
正确的x2是非后代，所以在其他方面
access third of X 5 is X 3 and X 1 all right

163
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,770
正确的x2是非后代，所以在其他方面
right x2 is a non descendant so in other ways

164
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:46,780
正确的x2是非后代，所以在其他方面
x2 is a non descendant so in other ways you can see the arrows you can go from 5

165
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,870
您可以看到箭头，您可以从5转到6
x2 is a non descendant so in other ways you can see the arrows you can go from 5

166
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,650
您可以看到箭头，您可以从5转到6
you can see the arrows you can go from 5 to 6

167
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:49,660
您可以看到箭头，您可以从5转到6
to 6 you know what to do so XQ is a non

168
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,140
你知道该怎么做，所以XQ是非后代，好了，再次，我们将看到这个
to 6 you know what to do so XQ is a non

169
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,590
你知道该怎么做，所以XQ是非后代，好了，再次，我们将看到这个
you know what to do so XQ is a non descender ok so again we will see this

170
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
你知道该怎么做，所以XQ是非后代，好了，再次，我们将看到这个
descender ok so again we will see this property together but given the power

171
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,660
在一起，但给定幂和X 3，则X 5的概率为
descender ok so again we will see this property together but given the power

172
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,600
在一起，但给定幂和X 3，则X 5的概率为
property together but given the power and X 3 this the probability of X 5 is

173
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:02,610
在一起，但给定幂和X 3，则X 5的概率为
and X 3 this the probability of X 5 is independent X 5 is independent of the

174
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,430
独立X 5独立于非依赖X且类似地依赖于
and X 3 this the probability of X 5 is independent X 5 is independent of the

175
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,220
独立X 5独立于非依赖X且类似地依赖于
independent X 5 is independent of the non depends on X and similarly on the

176
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,230
独立X 5独立于非依赖X且类似地依赖于
non depends on X and similarly on the second probability I plug in what I can

177
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,330
第二个可能性是我在这里插入3我给定的X 2和X 5 2和5
non depends on X and similarly on the second probability I plug in what I can

178
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,350
第二个可能性是我在这里插入3我给定的X 2和X 5 2和5
second probability I plug in what I can here 3 so given X 2 and X 5 2 and 5

179
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:16,360
第二个可能性是我在这里插入3我给定的X 2和X 5 2和5
here 3 so given X 2 and X 5 2 and 5 which are the parents of extinct I plug

180
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,380
这是我灭绝的父母，我插入了3，而3是你所知道的
here 3 so given X 2 and X 5 2 and 5 which are the parents of extinct I plug

181
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:25,230
这是我灭绝的父母，我插入了3，而3是你所知道的
which are the parents of extinct I plug in 3 and 3 is a what it's a you know

182
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,240
这是我灭绝的父母，我插入了3，而3是你所知道的
in 3 and 3 is a what it's a you know it's obviously not descendant but it you

183
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,970
这显然不是后裔，但你知道这基本上是祖父母50
in 3 and 3 is a what it's a you know it's obviously not descendant but it you

184
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,560
这显然不是后裔，但你知道这基本上是祖父母50
it's obviously not descendant but it you know it's a grandparent basically 50

185
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:33,570
这显然不是后裔，但你知道这基本上是祖父母50
know it's a grandparent basically 50 okay it's an ancestor of lectures okay

186
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,500
好吧，这是讲座的祖先，好吧，因为我必须插入这个
know it's a grandparent basically 50 okay it's an ancestor of lectures okay

187
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,800
好吧，这是讲座的祖先，好吧，因为我必须插入这个
okay it's an ancestor of lectures okay so in the reason I have to plug in this

188
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:40,810
好吧，这是讲座的祖先，好吧，因为我必须插入这个
so in the reason I have to plug in this time start is because these two

189
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,690
时间开始是因为这两个分布一起给了我
so in the reason I have to plug in this time start is because these two

190
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,730
时间开始是因为这两个分布一起给了我
time start is because these two distributions together they give me the

191
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:44,740
时间开始是因为这两个分布一起给了我
distributions together they give me the probability of X 5 and X 6 condition X 2

192
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,670
X 5和X 6条件X 2 X 3的概率，如果我将X 5完全积分
distributions together they give me the probability of X 5 and X 6 condition X 2

193
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,430
X 5和X 6条件X 2 X 3的概率，如果我将X 5完全积分
probability of X 5 and X 6 condition X 2 X 3 and if I integrate X 5 altogether

194
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:50,440
X 5和X 6条件X 2 X 3的概率，如果我将X 5完全积分
X 3 and if I integrate X 5 altogether from Reliford 6 given X 2 X 3 and then

195
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,700
从Reliford 6得到X 2 X 3，那么这个身份就可以了
X 3 and if I integrate X 5 altogether from Reliford 6 given X 2 X 3 and then

196
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,790
从Reliford 6得到X 2 X 3，那么这个身份就可以了
from Reliford 6 given X 2 X 3 and then this identity has been put okay

197
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:57,800
从Reliford 6得到X 2 X 3，那么这个身份就可以了
this identity has been put okay so this way when tisha here at work is a

198
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,090
因此，当tisha在这里工作时，这是很多重要的小事情
this identity has been put okay so this way when tisha here at work is a

199
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,169
因此，当tisha在这里工作时，这是很多重要的小事情
so this way when tisha here at work is a lot of little things that are important

200
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:05,179
因此，当tisha在这里工作时，这是很多重要的小事情
lot of little things that are important basically when you work with high

201
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:06,429
基本上，当您使用高维分布时，很明显
lot of little things that are important basically when you work with high

202
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:09,280
基本上，当您使用高维分布时，很明显
basically when you work with high dimensional distributions so obviously

203
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,290
基本上，当您使用高维分布时，很明显
dimensional distributions so obviously we use the factorization of this

204
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,929
我们使用图的这种分布的因式分解，我们设法
dimensional distributions so obviously we use the factorization of this

205
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:17,229
我们使用图的这种分布的因式分解，我们设法
we use the factorization of this distribution of the graph we managed to

206
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:17,239
我们使用图的这种分布的因式分解，我们设法
distribution of the graph we managed to do some of the optimizations by

207
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:19,059
通过适当地删除站点中的站点来进行一些优化
distribution of the graph we managed to do some of the optimizations by

208
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:21,759
通过适当地删除站点中的站点来进行一些优化
do some of the optimizations by appropriately removing the stations in

209
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:21,769
通过适当地删除站点中的站点来进行一些优化
appropriately removing the stations in words okay starting basically from the

210
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:25,509
可以的话基本上是从Leafs的基础开始，然后最终
appropriately removing the stations in words okay starting basically from the

211
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:28,030
可以的话基本上是从Leafs的基础开始，然后最终
words okay starting basically from the Leafs base and then eventually going to

212
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,040
可以的话基本上是从Leafs的基础开始，然后最终
Leafs base and then eventually going to the to the root as needed and then we

213
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,710
根据需要到根，然后我们在这里使用独立关系
Leafs base and then eventually going to the to the root as needed and then we

214
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,710
根据需要到根，然后我们在这里使用独立关系
the to the root as needed and then we use the independence relation here of

215
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:35,720
根据需要到根，然后我们在这里使用独立关系
use the independence relation here of the parent overall being given the parts

216
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,679
父母整体被赋予独立的部分，没有后代；
use the independence relation here of the parent overall being given the parts

217
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:42,119
父母整体被赋予独立的部分，没有后代；
the parent overall being given the parts being independent no descendants and

218
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:42,129
父母整体被赋予独立的部分，没有后代；
being independent no descendants and that's it okay so let me we discuss this

219
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:49,780
没关系，所以让我讨论这个例子，但我想回到它后面，
being independent no descendants and that's it okay so let me we discuss this

220
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,400
没关系，所以让我讨论这个例子，但我想回到它后面，
that's it okay so let me we discuss this example but I want to go back to it and

221
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,410
没关系，所以让我讨论这个例子，但我想回到它后面，
example but I want to go back to it and then we will do this with again with the

222
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:56,049
然后我们将再次使用蒸馏算法进行此操作，因此我们有一个案例
example but I want to go back to it and then we will do this with again with the

223
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:59,499
然后我们将再次使用蒸馏算法进行此操作，因此我们有一个案例
then we will do this with again with the distillation algorithm so we have a case

224
00:12:59,499 --> 00:12:59,509
然后我们将再次使用蒸馏算法进行此操作，因此我们有一个案例
distillation algorithm so we have a case here over wet grass sprinkler being on

225
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:04,389
这里的湿草喷头总体上上下雨，所以基本上这些
distillation algorithm so we have a case here over wet grass sprinkler being on

226
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:07,090
这里的湿草喷头总体上上下雨，所以基本上这些
here over wet grass sprinkler being on or off rain overall so basically these

227
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,100
这里的湿草喷头总体上上下雨，所以基本上这些
or off rain overall so basically these are binary variables okay and you can

228
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,679
是二进制变量，可以看到各种问题之一
or off rain overall so basically these are binary variables okay and you can

229
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,309
是二进制变量，可以看到各种问题之一
are binary variables okay and you can see various problems one the goes from

230
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:15,319
是二进制变量，可以看到各种问题之一
see various problems one the goes from causes to effects such as cloudy this

231
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:18,699
导致诸如多云的影响，这将导致下雨，这将导致
see various problems one the goes from causes to effects such as cloudy this

00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:27,679
说玻璃会被弄湿，到目前为止B中的推断问题是玻璃
inference problems in B is the glass weren't given that's cloudy

237
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,249
没有得到多云的消息，因此来自
inference problems in B is the glass weren't given that's cloudy

238
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:32,350
没有得到多云的消息，因此来自
weren't given that's cloudy right so information from a gates in the

239
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:32,360
没有得到多云的消息，因此来自
right so information from a gates in the direction of the graph all right so this

240
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,660
图的方向很好，所以这是从正x开始的，那就是
right so information from a gates in the direction of the graph all right so this

241
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,449
图的方向很好，所以这是从正x开始的，那就是
direction of the graph all right so this is from positive x and that's the

242
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:37,459
图的方向很好，所以这是从正x开始的，那就是
is from positive x and that's the problem

243
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:38,309
好吧，这是一个非常简单的问题
is from positive x and that's the problem

244
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:42,129
好吧，这是一个非常简单的问题
all right so that's a very easy problem this is very similar sort of to what you

245
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:45,850
这与您在贝叶斯统计中所做的非常相似
all right so that's a very easy problem this is very similar sort of to what you

246
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,530
这与您在贝叶斯统计中所做的非常相似
this is very similar sort of to what you do in Bayesian statistics will be likely

247
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:47,540
这与您在贝叶斯统计中所做的非常相似
do in Bayesian statistics will be likely to write if you know the parameters what

248
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,929
写，如果你知道参数是什么输出，所以这会导致
do in Bayesian statistics will be likely to write if you know the parameters what

249
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,350
写，如果你知道参数是什么输出，所以这会导致
to write if you know the parameters what is the output so here this causes the

250
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360
写，如果你知道参数是什么输出，所以这会导致
is the output so here this causes the grass to be red so you're asking what is

251
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,140
草是红色的，所以您要问的是，续集等于1
is the output so here this causes the grass to be red so you're asking what is

256
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:03,950
最重要的问题是去工厂的英语问题
English problem to go for the factory closes so if the grass is wet somebody

257
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,490
关闭，这样如果草是湿的，有人可以说是在下雨吗
English problem to go for the factory closes so if the grass is wet somebody

258
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,570
关闭，这样如果草是湿的，有人可以说是在下雨吗
closes so if the grass is wet somebody can say is it raining in other words if

259
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:10,580
关闭，这样如果草是湿的，有人可以说是在下雨吗
can say is it raining in other words if W is equal to R is R equal to R what's

260
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,850
W等于R等于R等于R L的概率更重要

00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:29,119
让我们接受这样的图表，这样我们就不必讨论所有细节了
we don't have to discuss all the details but basically the parents of this are

411
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,489
但基本上，父母没有智力上的困难
we don't have to discuss all the details but basically the parents of this are

there's no difficulty in intelligence but you know the socialist idea is a non

414
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,049
但是你知道社会主义的想法是一个非后裔权利，所以这不会
there's no difficulty in intelligence but you know the socialist idea is a non

415
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:45,580
但是你知道社会主义的想法是一个非后裔权利，所以这不会
but you know the socialist idea is a non descender right so wouldn't be ni this

416
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:45,590
但是你知道社会主义的想法是一个非后裔权利，所以这不会
descender right so wouldn't be ni this no this is the friend of SAT okay the

417
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,389
不，这是SAT的朋友，好的，这是我正在讨论的内容
descender right so wouldn't be ni this no this is the friend of SAT okay the

419
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:51,590
不，这是SAT的朋友，好的，这是我正在讨论的内容
note is something that I am discussing on the bottle but if you look at the

420
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,239
在瓶子上，但如果您在难度上看的方式大相径庭
note is something that I am discussing on the bottle but if you look at the

421

在瓶子上，但如果您在难度上看的方式大相径庭
on the bottle but if you look at the great differently in terms of difficulty

422
00:19:58,629 --> 00:19:58,639
在瓶子上，但如果您在难度上看的方式大相径庭
great differently in terms of difficulty alright it's not independent of the

423
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:02,200
好吧，这不是独立于字母的权利，因为这不是
great differently in terms of difficulty alright it's not independent of the

424
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:09,310
好吧，这不是独立于字母的权利，因为这不是
alright it's not independent of the letter right because this is this is not

425
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:09,320
好吧，这不是独立于字母的权利，因为这不是
letter right because this is this is not in the list of the non-descendants okay

426
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,409
在非后裔列表中，所以给定a和G并不是独立的
letter right because this is this is not in the list of the non-descendants okay

427
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:17,259
在非后裔列表中，所以给定a和G并不是独立的
in the list of the non-descendants okay so G is not independent well given a and

428
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:17,269
在非后裔列表中，所以给定a和G并不是独立的
so G is not independent well given a and B

429
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:19,419
乙
so G is not independent well given a and B

430
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:22,330

started parameters in the module for example we would say you know you

455
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,989
例如，我们会说您知道您分解了联合概率
started parameters in the module for example we would say you know you

is alone and everything is unknown means the toast probabilities in this table

468
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,529
该表中的烤面包概率是那些参数theta可以，所以
the toast probabilities in this table are those parameters theta all right so

469
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:35,539
该表中的烤面包概率是那些参数theta可以，所以
are those parameters theta all right so there is how are you there are two

470

475
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:47,539
斯科蒂参数theta和那些优先级theta不会随着您的
priorities theta don't increase as your dataset increases so for example in the

476
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,019
数据集增加，例如在隐藏的马尔可夫模型中，您可以保持
priorities theta don't increase as your dataset increases so for example in the

477
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:51,700

the same ok and we will do those things later on

482
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,470
好的，我们稍后会做这些事情，但是阴影变量的数量
the same ok and we will do those things later on

483
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,909
好的，我们稍后会做这些事情，但是阴影变量的数量
ok and we will do those things later on but the number of shaded variables

484
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:02,919
好的，我们稍后会做这些事情，但是阴影变量的数量
but the number of shaded variables increases the number of observation data

485
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:05,710
增加观察数据类型的数量增加还可以，所以从某种意义上讲
but the number of shaded variables increases the number of observation data

486
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,850
增加观察数据类型的数量增加还可以，所以从某种意义上讲
increases the number of observation data type increases okay so in some sense the

487
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:09,860
增加观察数据类型的数量增加还可以，所以从某种意义上讲
type increases okay so in some sense the hidden exists and treated differently

488
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,700
隐藏的存在与计算有所不同
type increases okay so in some sense the hidden exists and treated differently

489

496
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:26,940
一两张幻灯片，我很惊讶，但这没关系，我不知道为什么
but this is okay I don't know why this thinking here all right it doesn't

497
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,560
认为这里没关系，我认为实际上是在谈论
but this is okay I don't know why this thinking here all right it doesn't

498
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,000
认为这里没关系，我认为实际上是在谈论
thinking here all right it doesn't matter I think actually talks about

499
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,010

502
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:38,970
证明我们要去了解这一点，所以这需要参数
bit so this takes the parameters people so let's say you know the conditional

503
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,700

so let's say you know the conditional distributions change your graph so

505
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:42,870
假设您知道条件分布会改变您的图表
distributions change your graph so that's why you stay conditioning or

506
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,750
这就是为什么您保持调理或theta的原因，所以我们不是油中毒的人
distributions change your graph so that's why you stay conditioning or

507
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,810
这就是为什么您保持调理或theta的原因，所以我们不是油中毒的人

okay we don't need this life we'll need some partial details so this

555
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:12,100
好吧，我们不需要这个生活，我们需要一些局部细节，所以这
we'll need some partial details so this is actually I mentioned that see that

556
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,510
实际上，我提到看到您要对其进行计算，以最大程度地提高
we'll need some partial details so this is actually I mentioned that see that

561
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:24,880
证据不关注这里的这一点到第二点我在这里做了什么
here to the second what have I done here before I had the probability of X being

562
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,080
在我将X赋予theta的概率之前，在这里我写了这是

563
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,890
在我将X赋予theta的概率之前，在这里我写了这是
before I had the probability of X being given theta so here I wrote this this is

564
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:31,900
在我将X赋予theta的概率之前，在这里我写了这是
given theta so here I wrote this this is sort of my new evidence the

565
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,720
我的新证据是对数似然数据逻辑，但我有
given theta so here I wrote this this is sort of my new evidence the

566
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,450

567
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:36,460
我的新证据是对数似然数据逻辑，但我有
log-likelihood data logical but I have done something else the fact I wrote the

568
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,070
我做了另一件事，事实是我在N上写了目的地，这是什么
log-likelihood data logical but I have done something else the fact I wrote the

569
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,470
我做了另一件事，事实是我在N上写了目的地，这是什么

570
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:40,480
我做了另一件事，事实是我在N上写了目的地，这是什么
destination over N so what is this summation you think why is Tommy what is

571
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,630
总结你认为汤米为什么是N什么是大写N
destination over N so what is this summation you think why is Tommy what is

572
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,750
总结你认为汤米为什么是N什么是大写N
summation you think why is Tommy what is N what's capital N

582
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:11,929
这样写就暗含的假设是我的广告数据
writing like this that my data by ad okay all right so so basically we're

583
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:16,000
好吧，所以基本上，我们正在尝试过滤掉减去日志的数据
writing like this that my data by ad okay all right so so basically we're

584
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,460
好吧，所以基本上，我们正在尝试过滤掉减去日志的数据
okay all right so so basically we're trying to filter that much minus the log

585
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:18,470
好吧，所以基本上，我们正在尝试过滤掉减去日志的数据

parent is independent of the non-disabled and I assume for the

978
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,220
非残障人士，我认为对于父母和前辈来说，
parent is independent of the non-disabled and I assume for the

979
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,789
非残障人士，我认为对于父母和前辈来说，
non-disabled and I assume for the parents and the predecessors are a

980
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:42,799
非残障人士，我认为对于父母和前辈来说，
parents and the predecessors are a subset of the you know descendants so T

981
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:45,670
您知道后代的子集，因此T独立于三个被告
parents and the predecessors are a subset of the you know descendants so T

983
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:48,619
您知道后代的子集，因此T独立于三个被告
is independent of the three defendants given the powers and so this is called

984
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:53,410
给定的权力，所以这被称为指令局部马尔可夫属性
is independent of the three defendants given the powers and so this is called

985
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,519
给定的权力，所以这被称为指令局部马尔可夫属性
given the powers and so this is called the directive local Markov property this

986
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:57,529
给定的权力，所以这被称为指令局部马尔可夫属性
the directive local Markov property this is called the order Markov property we

987
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:59,319
被称为订单马尔可夫财产，我们可以欣赏为什么它是伦敦的
the directive local Markov property this is called the order Markov property we

988
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:01,000
被称为订单马尔可夫财产，我们可以欣赏为什么它是伦敦的
is called the order Markov property we can appreciate why it's for London

989
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,010
被称为订单马尔可夫财产，我们可以欣赏为什么它是伦敦的
can appreciate why it's for London because in essence this knowledge of

990
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:05,200
因为从本质上讲，这种在T数之前的编号知识
can appreciate why it's for London because in essence this knowledge of

991
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,559
因为从本质上讲，这种在T数之前的编号知识
because in essence this knowledge of numbering that is before the number of T

this property is true then also the other properties to all right and that

1001
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:32,450
这个属性是正确的，那么其他属性也是正确的，
other properties to all right and that makes a bit of calculation if you are

00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:38,180
我必须在午餐时间喝点咖啡，因为从我的系统开始
because from my system it's gotten at this time and without it we may still

1034
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,160
这次，没有它，我们可能仍然会在这个小地方一样，但是一个
because from my system it's gotten at this time and without it we may still

this time and without it we may still equally in this little here okay but one

1036
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:46,100
这次，没有它，我们可能仍然会在这个小地方一样，但是一个
equally in this little here okay but one day I'm sure that you see all the coffee

1037
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,890
那天，我敢肯定，您会发现我头顶上所有的咖啡都没有付

00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:50,900
那天，我敢肯定，您会发现我头顶上所有的咖啡都没有付
coming on the top of me not paying attention because talking and drinking

1040
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,800
注意，因为可以继续聊天和喝咖啡而不是丛林
coming on the top of me not paying attention because talking and drinking

1042
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:56,020
注意，因为可以继续聊天和喝咖啡而不是丛林
coffees not the jungle can be continued so drinking wine isn't talking

1043
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,000
所以喝酒不是很好，这会有点
coffees not the jungle can be continued so drinking wine isn't talking

1044
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,970
所以喝酒不是很好，这会有点
so drinking wine isn't talking alright and this is going to be a little

1045
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:06,980
所以喝酒不是很好，这会有点
alright and this is going to be a little bit weird it's not very public is

1046
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,550
有点奇怪，它不是很公开，基本上是图形化的图形显示方式
alright and this is going to be a little bit weird it's not very public is

1047
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:14,050
有点奇怪，它不是很公开，基本上是图形化的图形显示方式
bit weird it's not very public is basically the graphical way to figure

00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:14,060
有点奇怪，它不是很公开，基本上是图形化的图形显示方式
basically the graphical way to figure out what independence relations you have

1049
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,180
找出你在图中有什么独立关系好吧，所以我们想
basically the graphical way to figure out what independence relations you have

1050
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:20,080
找出你在图中有什么独立关系好吧，所以我们想
out what independence relations you have in a graph okay so we want to dis have a

1051
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,090
找出你在图中有什么独立关系好吧，所以我们想
in a graph okay so we want to dis have a calculation so I'll go under the name

1052
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:24,370
计算，所以我将以这种分离为名
in a graph okay so we want to dis have a calculation so I'll go under the name

1053
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:27,070
计算，所以我将以这种分离为名
calculation so I'll go under the name this separation is what is going to

1054
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:27,080
计算，所以我将以这种分离为名
this separation is what is going to allow us to figure out independence in

1055
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,560
让我们找出图表中的独立性，所以我不得不承认
this separation is what is going to allow us to figure out independence in

1056
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,850
让我们找出图表中的独立性，所以我不得不承认
allow us to figure out independence in the graph so I have to admit when you

1057
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:33,860
让我们找出图表中的独立性，所以我不得不承认
the graph so I have to admit when you first see them this may sound a little

1058
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,740
首先看到他们，这听起来可能有点怪异，我要做的唯一一件事是
the graph so I have to admit when you first see them this may sound a little

00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,590
首先看到他们，这听起来可能有点怪异，我要做的唯一一件事是
first see them this may sound a little bit weird the only thing I'm going to

1060
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:38,600
首先看到他们，这听起来可能有点怪异，我要做的唯一一件事是
bit weird the only thing I'm going to say just our homes because Rose has to

1061
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,250
说我们的家，因为玫瑰必须决定，您可以世俗地满足
bit weird the only thing I'm going to say just our homes because Rose has to

1062
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45,670
说我们的家，因为玫瑰必须决定，您可以世俗地满足

1063
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:45,680
说我们的家，因为玫瑰必须决定，您可以世俗地满足
decide and you can secular satisfied then you can test independence

1064
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,920
然后你可以测试独立性关系
decide and you can secular satisfied then you can test independence

1065
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,880
然后你可以测试独立性关系
then you can test independence relationships

1066
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:48,890
然后你可以测试独立性关系
relationships so this'll look like something will

1067
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,220
所以这看起来像是某种驱动力，因此我们不能因为这个原因你可以
relationships so this'll look like something will

1068
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:54,010
所以这看起来像是某种驱动力，因此我们不能因为这个原因你可以
so this'll look like something will drive we cannot for this reason you can

1069
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:54,020
所以这看起来像是某种驱动力，因此我们不能因为这个原因你可以
drive we cannot for this reason you can solve that they're equivalent to this

1070
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,400
解决它们等同于我们在本地标记的属性
drive we cannot for this reason you can solve that they're equivalent to this

解决它们等同于我们在本地标记的属性
local mark of properties that we discussed before and this will go on the

1073
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,330
之前讨论过，这将继续使用分离的名称，因此那里的定义

1075
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:05,600
之前讨论过，这将继续使用分离的名称，因此那里的定义
name the separation so definitions there is way too much information that's right

1076
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,210
太多的信息是正确的，所以让我们逐行且无方向地走

至少是托尼·霍克（Tony Hawk）之一，所以在各种图表中您都可以看到这是我的
least one of the Tony Hawk so in the various graphs that you see this is my

1087
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:27,320
至少是托尼·霍克（Tony Hawk）之一，所以在各种图表中您都可以看到这是我的
various graphs that you see this is my evidence right this is my evidence

1088
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,090
正确的证据，这是我的证据，所以这里从X到Z的路径正确
various graphs that you see this is my evidence right this is my evidence

1089
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:37,900
正确的证据，这是我的证据，所以这里从X到Z的路径正确
evidence right this is my evidence so here the path from X to Z right the

1090
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:37,910
正确的证据，这是我的证据，所以这里从X到Z的路径正确
so here the path from X to Z right the arrows point in this way but

1091
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,970
箭头以这种方式指向，但也可以找到相反的方式，因此它可以
so here the path from X to Z right the arrows point in this way but

1092
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:42,670
箭头以这种方式指向，但也可以找到相反的方式，因此它可以
arrows point in this way but can also find the opposite way so it can

1093
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:42,680
箭头以这种方式指向，但也可以找到相反的方式，因此它可以
can also find the opposite way so it can be this or that so in this case we say

1094
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,240
是这个或那个，在这种情况下，我们说x和z与Y分开，如果
can also find the opposite way so it can be this or that so in this case we say

1095
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,460
是这个或那个，在这种情况下，我们说x和z与Y分开，如果
be this or that so in this case we say that x and z are be separated from Y if

1096
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:51,470
是这个或那个，在这种情况下，我们说x和z与Y分开，如果
that x and z are be separated from Y if Y is observed okay so a lot of times

1097
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:57,570
观察到Y很好，所以很多时候你所说的基本上是
that x and z are be separated from Y if Y is observed okay so a lot of times

1098
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:01,210
观察到Y很好，所以很多时候你所说的基本上是
Y is observed okay so a lot of times what you say basically is whenever this

1099
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:01,220
观察到Y很好，所以很多时候你所说的基本上是
what you say basically is whenever this node and you see the arrow converging

1100
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,090
节点，您会看到箭头融合了这个机会和尾巴，所以如果您有
what you say basically is whenever this node and you see the arrow converging

1101
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,640
节点，您会看到箭头融合了这个机会和尾巴，所以如果您有
node and you see the arrow converging this chance and tail so if you have

1102
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:06,650
节点，您会看到箭头融合了这个机会和尾巴，所以如果您有
this chance and tail so if you have heads entailed already obtained and

1103
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,980
头需要已经获得，并分享相反的方式，这是
this chance and tail so if you have heads entailed already obtained and

1104
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,740
头需要已经获得，并分享相反的方式，这是
heads entailed already obtained and shares the other way around and this is

1105
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:11,750
头需要已经获得，并分享相反的方式，这是
shares the other way around and this is an observed node the next year this

1106
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,500
第二年给该操作员一个观察节点，好吧。帕雷蒂
shares the other way around and this is an observed node the next year this

1107
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,880
第二年给该操作员一个观察节点，好吧。帕雷蒂
an observed node the next year this operator is given Y okay mr. Paretti so

1108
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:18,890
第二年给该操作员一个观察节点，好吧。帕雷蒂
operator is given Y okay mr. Paretti so you can you can start getting the

1109
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:20,380
您可以开始正确理解这个概念，这意味着他们是德克萨斯人
operator is given Y okay mr. Paretti so you can you can start getting the

1110
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:23,050
您可以开始正确理解这个概念，这意味着他们是德克萨斯人
you can you can start getting the concept right means the Texans they're

1111
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:23,060
您可以开始正确理解这个概念，这意味着他们是德克萨斯人
concept right means the Texans they're independent really given Y reinstitute

1112
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,750
独立的真正给定的Y重新通过X而不是X真正丰富了Z
concept right means the Texans they're independent really given Y reinstitute

1113
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:29,140
独立的真正给定的Y重新通过X而不是X真正丰富了Z
independent really given Y reinstitute not really rich Z from X by going

1114
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:29,150
独立的真正给定的Y重新通过X而不是X真正丰富了Z
not really rich Z from X by going through the evidence known why okay and

1115
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,990
通过已知的证据证明为什么还可以，以及您看到的这种小块
not really rich Z from X by going through the evidence known why okay and

1116
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:37,630
通过已知的证据证明为什么还可以，以及您看到的这种小块
through the evidence known why okay and this sort of little blocks that you see

1117
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:37,640
通过已知的证据证明为什么还可以，以及您看到的这种小块
this sort of little blocks that you see on the bottom that's what they indicate

1118
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,950
它们指示的是底部，但从某种意义上说，从X到Z的路径是
this sort of little blocks that you see on the bottom that's what they indicate

1119
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:42,280
它们指示的是底部，但从某种意义上说，从X到Z的路径是
on the bottom that's what they indicate but somehow the path from X to Z is

1120
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:42,290
它们指示的是底部，但从某种意义上说，从X到Z的路径是
but somehow the path from X to Z is broke if you observe why okay I'm

1121
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:46,600
如果您观察为什么会坏，那么我在那里扔了很多术语，但是
but somehow the path from X to Z is broke if you observe why okay I'm

1122
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,130
如果您观察为什么会坏，那么我在那里扔了很多术语，但是
broke if you observe why okay I'm throwing a lots of terminology there but

1123
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:50,140
如果您观察为什么会坏，那么我在那里扔了很多术语，但是
throwing a lots of terminology there but so this is one part of the definition if

1124
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,020
因此，如果您遇到这种情况并明智地观察，那么这就是定义的一部分
throwing a lots of terminology there but so this is one part of the definition if

1125
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,910
因此，如果您遇到这种情况并明智地观察，那么这就是定义的一部分
so this is one part of the definition if you have this situation and wise observe

1126
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:54,920
因此，如果您遇到这种情况并明智地观察，那么这就是定义的一部分
you have this situation and wise observe okay excellent zero disparate from Y

1127
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,250
好，与Y的差值为零，另一种情况是，如果您有股票
you have this situation and wise observe okay excellent zero disparate from Y

1128
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:04,390
好，与Y的差值为零，另一种情况是，如果您有股票
okay excellent zero disparate from Y another case is when if you have a stock

1129
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:04,400
好，与Y的差值为零，另一种情况是，如果您有股票
another case is when if you have a stock situation right so this is the parent

1130
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,270
情况正确，所以这是父母指向两个孩子，所以我们再次
another case is when if you have a stock situation right so this is the parent

1131
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:11,620
情况正确，所以这是父母指向两个孩子，所以我们再次
situation right so this is the parent pointing into two children so again we

1132
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:11,630
情况正确，所以这是父母指向两个孩子，所以我们再次
pointing into two children so again we contain support and wise and evidence

1133
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:14,640
然后包含支持，智慧和证据，并被Y隔开
pointing into two children so again we contain support and wise and evidence

1134
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,190
然后包含支持，智慧和证据，并被Y隔开
contain support and wise and evidence excellency then and be separated by Y so

1135
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:18,200
然后包含支持，智慧和证据，并被Y隔开
excellency then and be separated by Y so again you notice the path is indicated

1136
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,040
再次，您注意到此处指示了路径，因为Z阻止了Z
excellency then and be separated by Y so again you notice the path is indicated

1137
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,940
再次，您注意到此处指示了路径，因为Z阻止了Z
again you notice the path is indicated here products the Z is blocked because Y

1138
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:24,950
再次，您注意到此处指示了路径，因为Z阻止了Z
here products the Z is blocked because Y doesn't allow this to go through

1139
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,160
不允许这样做，并尝试从X到Z或从种子
here products the Z is blocked because Y doesn't allow this to go through

1140
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,589
不允许这样做，并尝试从X到Z或从种子
doesn't allow this to go through and try to go from X to Z or from seed

1141
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:29,599
不允许这样做，并尝试从X到Z或从种子
and try to go from X to Z or from seed to X the pocketbook have instead what's

1142
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:35,260
到口袋里的X却与独立性有什么关系
and try to go from X to Z or from seed to X the pocketbook have instead what's

1143
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,789
到口袋里的X却与独立性有什么关系
to X the pocketbook have instead what's the relation with independence for

1144
00:45:36,789 --> 00:45:36,799
到口袋里的X却与独立性有什么关系
the relation with independence for anything I'm defining I'm just giving

1145
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:38,799
我正在定义的任何内容我只是在给出一些定义，但是我们可以
the relation with independence for anything I'm defining I'm just giving

1146
00:45:38,799 --> 00:45:42,039
我正在定义的任何内容我只是在给出一些定义，但是我们可以
anything I'm defining I'm just giving some definitions right but we can

1147
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:42,049
我正在定义的任何内容我只是在给出一些定义，但是我们可以
some definitions right but we can motivate what these definitions are

1148
00:45:42,049 --> 00:45:43,870
激发这些定义的正确性，所以我们将再次
some definitions right but we can motivate what these definitions are

1149
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:46,990
激发这些定义的正确性，所以我们将再次
motivate what these definitions are going to be about okay so again we will

1150
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:47,000
激发这些定义的正确性，所以我们将再次
going to be about okay so again we will show that in this case given Y and

1151
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,839
显示在这种情况下，给定Y并与给定的Y共享此fork结构
going to be about okay so again we will show that in this case given Y and

1152
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,059
显示在这种情况下，给定Y并与给定的Y共享此fork结构
show that in this case given Y and sharing this fork structure with Y given

1153
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:52,069
显示在这种情况下，给定Y并与给定的Y共享此fork结构
sharing this fork structure with Y given being in the evidence actions here

1154
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:54,130
在给定Y和条件的情况下在证据行动中有条件地独立
sharing this fork structure with Y given being in the evidence actions here

1155
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,390
在给定Y和条件的情况下在证据行动中有条件地独立
being in the evidence actions here conditionally independent given Y and

1156
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:58,400
在给定Y和条件的情况下在证据行动中有条件地独立
conditionally independent given Y and then of course we have this explaining

1157
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,319
那么我们当然可以用这种解释方式来解释X和G为
conditionally independent given Y and then of course we have this explaining

1158
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:08,680
那么我们当然可以用这种解释方式来解释X和G为
then of course we have this explaining away situation where we have X and G be

1159
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:08,690
那么我们当然可以用这种解释方式来解释X和G为
away situation where we have X and G be the causes of the same Y right so the

1160
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:13,750
导致相同的Y的原因正确，因此，此处的箭头是重组
away situation where we have X and G be the causes of the same Y right so the

1161
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,960
导致相同的Y的原因正确，因此，此处的箭头是重组
the causes of the same Y right so the arrows bullet at this is a restructure

1162
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:16,970
导致相同的Y的原因正确，因此，此处的箭头是重组
arrows bullet at this is a restructure and notice that the patient suddenly

1163
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:19,839
并注意到病人突然改变了
arrows bullet at this is a restructure and notice that the patient suddenly

1164
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:20,890
并注意到病人突然改变了
and notice that the patient suddenly changed

1165
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:20,900
并注意到病人突然改变了
changed it says they contain service trucks like

1166
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,890
它说他们包含像这样的服务卡车，我们说Z中的文字是
changed it says they contain service trucks like

1167
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,720
它说他们包含像这样的服务卡车，我们说Z中的文字是
it says they contain service trucks like that and we say the text in Z are

1168
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:27,730
它说他们包含像这样的服务卡车，我们说Z中的文字是
that and we say the text in Z are dissipated if the destruction like math

1169
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:31,240
如果像数学和y这样的破坏没有在证据中消失，为什么不消失
that and we say the text in Z are dissipated if the destruction like math

1170
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,990
如果像数学和y这样的破坏没有在证据中消失，为什么不消失
dissipated if the destruction like math and y is not in the evidence why is not

1171
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:35,000
如果像数学和y这样的破坏没有在证据中消失，为什么不消失
and y is not in the evidence why is not observed so in other ways the path from

1172
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,920
观察到，因此，如果y不安全，则从X到Z的路径将被阻塞
and y is not in the evidence why is not observed so in other ways the path from

1173
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:44,380
观察到，因此，如果y不安全，则从X到Z的路径将被阻塞
observed so in other ways the path from X to Z is block if y is not a safe

1174
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,890
完美，为什么没有设置好
observed so in other ways the path from X to Z is block if y is not a safe

1175
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:45,900
完美，为什么没有设置好


1176
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:53,090
完美，为什么没有设置好
perfect why is nothing set okay

1177
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,240
所以基本上，如果没有明智地观察，我们会在漫画界看到
perfect why is nothing set okay

1178
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:54,250
所以基本上，如果没有明智地观察，我们会在漫画界看到


1179
00:46:54,250 --> 00:47:00,990
所以基本上，如果没有明智地观察，我们会在漫画界看到
so basically if wise not observed we will see in the comics life that

1180
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:01,000
所以基本上，如果没有明智地观察，我们会在漫画界看到
will see in the comics life that excellency you know are they will give

1181
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,720
您知道的是，他们会给这个例子，我们对X和Z说了什么
will see in the comics life that excellency you know are they will give

1182
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,910
您知道的是，他们会给这个例子，我们对X和Z说了什么
excellency you know are they will give this example what did we say for X and Z

1183
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:08,920
您知道的是，他们会给这个例子，我们对X和Z说了什么
this example what did we say for X and Z alone what did we say there were

1184
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:17,130
独自一人，我们说了什么，那帅哥没有防备，所以
this example what did we say for X and Z alone what did we say there were

1185
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:19,440
独自一人，我们说了什么，那帅哥没有防备，所以
alone what did we say there were handsome undefended all right so

1186
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:19,450
独自一人，我们说了什么，那帅哥没有防备，所以
handsome undefended all right so obviously this wise and himself I know

1187
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:21,570
显然，这个智者和他本人我不知道大炮的优越性
handsome undefended all right so obviously this wise and himself I know

1188
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:22,920
显然，这个智者和他本人我不知道大炮的优越性
obviously this wise and himself I know not the excellency of artillery

1189
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:22,930
显然，这个智者和他本人我不知道大炮的优越性
not the excellency of artillery independent once I observed why they

1190
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:25,680
我观察到他们为什么变得依赖后就独立了
not the excellency of artillery independent once I observed why they

1191
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,390
我观察到他们为什么变得依赖后就独立了
independent once I observed why they become dependent okay

1192
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:33,700
因此，在我们完成操作之前，您已经知道XY和z注释，但是您可以告诉您，
independent once I observed why they become dependent okay

1193
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:33,710
因此，在我们完成操作之前，您已经知道XY和z注释，但是您可以告诉您，


1194
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:39,309
因此，在我们完成操作之前，您已经知道XY和z注释，但是您可以告诉您，
so before we had done you you know XY &amp; z notes but you can tell relies this to

1195
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:39,319
因此，在我们完成操作之前，您已经知道XY和z注释，但是您可以告诉您，
z notes but you can tell relies this to a set of notes or fear percentage we

1196
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:41,289
一组注释或恐惧百分比，我们不说在给定图中说
z notes but you can tell relies this to a set of notes or fear percentage we

1197
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:44,920
一组注释或恐惧百分比，我们不说在给定图中说
a set of notes or fear percentage we don't say we say that in a given graph

1198
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:44,930
一组注释或恐惧百分比，我们不说在给定图中说
don't say we say that in a given graph is dissipated from a set of notes be

1199
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,049
从一组音符中耗散，在没有第60步的情况下得到一些证据
don't say we say that in a given graph is dissipated from a set of notes be

1200
00:47:47,049 --> 00:47:49,809
从一组音符中耗散，在没有第60步的情况下得到一些证据
is dissipated from a set of notes be given some evidence on the step of no 60

1201
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:49,819
从一组音符中耗散，在没有第60步的情况下得到一些证据
given some evidence on the step of no 60 if basically this is be separated from

1202
00:47:49,819 --> 00:47:57,910
如果基本上将其与给定的e分开，则尝试神秘
given some evidence on the step of no 60 if basically this is be separated from

1203
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:00,400
如果基本上将其与给定的e分开，则尝试神秘
if basically this is be separated from the given e so to try to mystical for

1204
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:00,410
如果基本上将其与给定的e分开，则尝试神秘
the given e so to try to mystical for any note way to an old in me to be

1205
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:06,099
以任何方式向我中的老人证明是知道这部分是可以的
the given e so to try to mystical for any note way to an old in me to be

1206
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:09,160
以任何方式向我中的老人证明是知道这部分是可以的
any note way to an old in me to be evidence knows that part is block okay

1207
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:09,170
以任何方式向我中的老人证明是知道这部分是可以的
evidence knows that part is block okay using the rules that we have seen so so

1208
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:17,859
使用我们已经看到的规则，所以这可能涉及一个小角度
evidence knows that part is block okay using the rules that we have seen so so

1209
00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:21,670
使用我们已经看到的规则，所以这可能涉及一个小角度
using the rules that we have seen so so this may involve a small angle it right

1210
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:21,680
使用我们已经看到的规则，所以这可能涉及一个小角度
this may involve a small angle it right I mean the thing is you know when you

1211
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,240
我的意思是，当您开始正确地放置此主题时，您就知道了
this may involve a small angle it right I mean the thing is you know when you

1212
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:30,210
我的意思是，当您开始正确地放置此主题时，您就知道了
I mean the thing is you know when you start putting this topics in place right

1213
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:30,220
我的意思是，当您开始正确地放置此主题时，您就知道了
start putting this topics in place right 350 years ago when people doing that you

1214
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:34,240
350年前，当人们这样做时，您可以称呼任何您知道的东西
start putting this topics in place right 350 years ago when people doing that you

1215
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,789
350年前，当人们这样做时，您可以称呼任何您知道的东西
350 years ago when people doing that you can call anything anything you know so

1216
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:36,799
350年前，当人们这样做时，您可以称呼任何您知道的东西
can call anything anything you know so the idea is I don't know the history I

1217
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:40,029
我的想法是我不知道先生的历史。多变
can call anything anything you know so the idea is I don't know the history I

1218
00:48:40,029 --> 00:48:41,980
我的想法是我不知道先生的历史。多变
the idea is I don't know the history I think is very possible mr. Vaile

1219
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:41,990
我的想法是我不知道先生的历史。多变
think is very possible mr. Vaile reference 98 introduced responsible very

1220
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:45,370
参考98引入的负责人很小，所以这个想法是要以图形方式
think is very possible mr. Vaile reference 98 introduced responsible very

1221
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:50,620
参考98引入的负责人很小，所以这个想法是要以图形方式
reference 98 introduced responsible very small so the idea is to to graphically

1222
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:50,630
参考98引入的负责人很小，所以这个想法是要以图形方式
small so the idea is to to graphically business operation the probable and you

1223
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:55,569
可能会进行业务操作，并且您尝试将文本扔掉而使球变形
small so the idea is to to graphically business operation the probable and you

1224
00:48:55,569 --> 00:48:57,579
可能会进行业务操作，并且您尝试将文本扔掉而使球变形
business operation the probable and you try to shape a ball that you throw text

1225
00:48:57,579 --> 00:48:57,589
可能会进行业务操作，并且您尝试将文本扔掉而使球变形
try to shape a ball that you throw text can reach Z all right and you have some

1226
00:48:57,589 --> 00:49:02,500
可以很好地达到Z，并且您有一些规则，最好的日期告诉您何时
try to shape a ball that you throw text can reach Z all right and you have some

1227
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,510
可以很好地达到Z，并且您有一些规则，最好的日期告诉您何时
can reach Z all right and you have some rules the best date tells you when the

1228
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:04,520
可以很好地达到Z，并且您有一些规则，最好的日期告诉您何时
rules the best date tells you when the ball can pass through and evidence we

1229
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,490
球可以通过，我们都不知道的证据
rules the best date tells you when the ball can pass through and evidence we

1230
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:07,390
球可以通过，我们都不知道的证据
ball can pass through and evidence we all don't know

1231
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:07,400
球可以通过，我们都不知道的证据
all don't know okay and so if you can read Z then

1232
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:13,390
好的，所以如果您可以阅读Z，那么基本上，如果您
all don't know okay and so if you can read Z then

1233
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:16,000
好的，所以如果您可以阅读Z，那么基本上，如果您
okay and so if you can read Z then basically the path is not block if you

1234
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,010
好的，所以如果您可以阅读Z，那么基本上，如果您
basically the path is not block if you cannot reach the path is blocked and the

1235
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:18,220
无法到达路径被阻塞，并且在有证据的情况下注释是独立的
basically the path is not block if you cannot reach the path is blocked and the

1236
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,779
无法到达路径被阻塞，并且在有证据的情况下注释是独立的
cannot reach the path is blocked and the notes are independent given the evidence

1237
00:49:19,779 --> 00:49:19,789
无法到达路径被阻塞，并且在有证据的情况下注释是独立的
notes are independent given the evidence so basically this is the same picture

1238
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:22,029
所以基本上，这是我们以前所见的同一幅画，但再想一想
notes are independent given the evidence so basically this is the same picture

1239
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:24,579
所以基本上，这是我们以前所见的同一幅画，但再想一想
so basically this is the same picture that we had before but again think

1240
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:24,589
所以基本上，这是我们以前所见的同一幅画，但再想一想
that we had before but again think you're throwing it home and it's

1241
00:49:24,589 --> 00:49:27,519
你把它扔回家，在东北很重要的一首歌叫做
that we had before but again think you're throwing it home and it's

1242
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:29,500
你把它扔回家，在东北很重要的一首歌叫做
you're throwing it home and it's important on the northeast a song called

1243
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:29,510
你把它扔回家，在东北很重要的一首歌叫做
important on the northeast a song called the most in travel offers it to be as

1244
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,839
旅行中最多的东西是正确的方向
important on the northeast a song called the most in travel offers it to be as

1245
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,849
旅行中最多的东西是正确的方向
the most in travel offers it to be as directions right

1246
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:34,859
旅行中最多的东西是正确的方向
directions right and this has to do with the fact that

1247
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:36,219
这与事实有关，在这种情况下，您知道箭头
directions right and this has to do with the fact that

1248
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:39,199
这与事实有关，在这种情况下，您知道箭头
and this has to do with the fact that you know like in this case the arrows

1249
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:39,209
这与事实有关，在这种情况下，您知道箭头
you know like in this case the arrows can look the other direction as well you

1250
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:41,269
可以看到另一个方向，您得到相同的结果，所以大多数人可以拥有
you know like in this case the arrows can look the other direction as well you

1251
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,939
可以看到另一个方向，您得到相同的结果，所以大多数人可以拥有
can look the other direction as well you get the same result so the most can have

1252
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:43,949
可以看到另一个方向，您得到相同的结果，所以大多数人可以拥有
get the same result so the most can have an opposite to the s directions so

1253
00:49:43,949 --> 00:49:46,849
与s方向相反，因此给出了为什么要抛出一个
get the same result so the most can have an opposite to the s directions so

1254
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:50,929
与s方向相反，因此给出了为什么要抛出一个
an opposite to the s directions so here's the case given why if you throw a

1255
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:50,939
与s方向相反，因此给出了为什么要抛出一个
here's the case given why if you throw a ball is blocked here so actions here be

1256
00:49:50,939 --> 00:49:54,890
球在这里被挡住，所以这里的动作被分开了
here's the case given why if you throw a ball is blocked here so actions here be

1257
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:55,759
球在这里被挡住，所以这里的动作被分开了
ball is blocked here so actions here be separated

1258
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:55,769
球在这里被挡住，所以这里的动作被分开了
separated if Y is not given the ball can go

1259
00:49:55,769 --> 00:49:58,160
如果没有给出Y，则球可以通过，如果Y，则可以从X到Z
separated if Y is not given the ball can go

1260
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,249
如果没有给出Y，则球可以通过，如果Y，则可以从X到Z
if Y is not given the ball can go through you can go from X to Z here if Y

1261
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:01,259
如果没有给出Y，则球可以通过，如果Y，则可以从X到Z
through you can go from X to Z here if Y is given to the spot from X Y Z is

1262
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:04,370
从XYZ到该点被封锁了，所以如果您知道怪物
through you can go from X to Z here if Y is given to the spot from X Y Z is

1263
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,859
从XYZ到该点被封锁了，所以如果您知道怪物
is given to the spot from X Y Z is blocked so if you you know the monster

1264
00:50:06,859 --> 00:50:06,869
从XYZ到该点被封锁了，所以如果您知道怪物
blocked so if you you know the monster me back so actions here independent

1265
00:50:06,869 --> 00:50:10,699
我回来了，所以这里的动作基本上独立于Y我只是给你
blocked so if you you know the monster me back so actions here independent

1266
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:12,679
我回来了，所以这里的动作基本上独立于Y我只是给你
me back so actions here independent basically given Y I'm just giving you

1267
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:12,689
我回来了，所以这里的动作基本上独立于Y我只是给你
basically given Y I'm just giving you this you know because this is what we're

1268
00:50:12,689 --> 00:50:14,989
你知道这是因为如果没有给出Y我们将再次使用
basically given Y I'm just giving you this you know because this is what we're

1269
00:50:14,989 --> 00:50:18,859
你知道这是因为如果没有给出Y我们将再次使用
this you know because this is what we're gonna use again if Y is not given then

1270
00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:18,869
你知道这是因为如果没有给出Y我们将再次使用
gonna use again if Y is not given then the ball can go from X to Z no problem

1271
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:22,880
球可以从X到Z没问题，这就是解释的一种方法
gonna use again if Y is not given then the ball can go from X to Z no problem

1272
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,729
球可以从X到Z没问题，这就是解释的一种方法
the ball can go from X to Z no problem and then this is the is explaining a way

1273
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:28,739
球可以从X到Z没问题，这就是解释的一种方法
and then this is the is explaining a way situation excellency the path is blocked

1274
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:32,419
情况优越，如果没有观察到Y，则路径被阻塞到Y
and then this is the is explaining a way situation excellency the path is blocked

1275
00:50:32,419 --> 00:50:36,019
情况优越，如果没有观察到Y，则路径被阻塞到Y
situation excellency the path is blocked to Y if Y is not observed was very

1276
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:36,029
情况优越，如果没有观察到Y，则路径被阻塞到Y
to Y if Y is not observed was very important it's observe then you can go

1277
00:50:36,029 --> 00:50:38,239
重要的是要观察，然后您可以从X转到Z，所以如果您还记得那些
to Y if Y is not observed was very important it's observe then you can go

1278
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:40,640
重要的是要观察，然后您可以从X转到Z，所以如果您还记得那些
important it's observe then you can go from X to Z so if you remember those

1279
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:40,650
重要的是要观察，然后您可以从X转到Z，所以如果您还记得那些
from X to Z so if you remember those rules basically you can test

1280
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:42,549
原则上，您可以在任何定向下降中测试独立性
from X to Z so if you remember those rules basically you can test

1281
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:45,169
原则上，您可以在任何定向下降中测试独立性
rules basically you can test independence in any directed drop

1282
00:50:45,169 --> 00:50:45,179
原则上，您可以在任何定向下降中测试独立性
independence in any directed drop without doing any calculations budget

1283
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:49,429
不用做任何计算，现在我说你可以做任何事情的预算
independence in any directed drop without doing any calculations budget

1284
00:50:49,429 --> 00:50:54,319
不用做任何计算，现在我说你可以做任何事情的预算
without doing any calculations budget okay now when I say you can do any

1285
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:54,329
不用做任何计算，现在我说你可以做任何事情的预算
okay now when I say you can do any calculations obviously books given with

1286
00:50:54,329 --> 00:50:56,719
计算显然带有135给出的书，但实际上它们给了您正确的
okay now when I say you can do any calculations obviously books given with

1287
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:58,969
计算显然带有135给出的书，但实际上它们给了您正确的
calculations obviously books given with 135 but actually they give you the right

1288
00:50:58,969 --> 00:50:58,979
计算显然带有135给出的书，但实际上它们给了您正确的
135 but actually they give you the right answers right so maybe I will do a

1289
00:50:58,979 --> 00:51:02,599
答案正确，所以也许我会做一个简单的例子，你们可以做更多
135 but actually they give you the right answers right so maybe I will do a

1290
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:04,219
答案正确，所以也许我会做一个简单的例子，你们可以做更多
answers right so maybe I will do a trivial example you guys can do a more

1291
00:51:04,219 --> 00:51:04,229
答案正确，所以也许我会做一个简单的例子，你们可以做更多
trivial example you guys can do a more complicated example but before you do an

1292
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:07,009
复杂的示例，但在您进行示例之前，我还需要告诉您哦
trivial example you guys can do a more complicated example but before you do an

1293
00:51:07,009 --> 00:51:10,400
复杂的示例，但在您进行示例之前，我还需要告诉您哦
complicated example but before you do an example I also need to tell you oh this

1294
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:10,410
复杂的示例，但在您进行示例之前，我还需要告诉您哦
example I also need to tell you oh this is the same slide but you have to

1295
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,380
是同一张幻灯片，但您必须在条件下进行确认，这样会发生什么情况
example I also need to tell you oh this is the same slide but you have to

1296
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:15,410
是同一张幻灯片，但您必须在条件下进行确认，这样会发生什么情况
is the same slide but you have to confirm under conditions so what happens

1297
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:15,420
是同一张幻灯片，但您必须在条件下进行确认，这样会发生什么情况
confirm under conditions so what happens is the bone which is the root node of

1298
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,089
是骨头，它是列表的根节点，因此有推动器
confirm under conditions so what happens is the bone which is the root node of

1299
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:20,089
是骨头，它是列表的根节点，因此有推动器
is the bone which is the root node of the list and so there are pusher to

1300
00:51:20,089 --> 00:51:20,099
是骨头，它是列表的根节点，因此有推动器
the list and so there are pusher to boundary conditions if you reach

1301
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:26,660
边界条件，如果您到达尼克节点并且观察到神话笔记
the list and so there are pusher to boundary conditions if you reach

1302
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,539
边界条件，如果您到达尼克节点并且观察到神话笔记
boundary conditions if you reach Nick node and the myth note is observed

1303
00:51:29,539 --> 00:51:29,549
边界条件，如果您到达尼克节点并且观察到神话笔记
Nick node and the myth note is observed the note comes back all right if this is

1304
00:51:29,549 --> 00:51:36,799
如果基本上观察到，便条纸会回到正确的位置，我们越多
Nick node and the myth note is observed the note comes back all right if this is

1305
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:39,529
如果基本上观察到，便条纸会回到正确的位置，我们越多
the note comes back all right if this is observed basically the more the us the

1306
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:39,539
如果基本上观察到，便条纸会回到正确的位置，我们越多
observed basically the more the us the ball okay now if the error goes in the

1307
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:45,470
现在，如果错误朝着另一个方向发展，现在可以了，那么在这种情况下，如果
observed basically the more the us the ball okay now if the error goes in the

1308
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:51,289
现在，如果错误朝着另一个方向发展，现在可以了，那么在这种情况下，如果
ball okay now if the error goes in the other direction okay so in this case if

1309
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:51,299
现在，如果错误朝着另一个方向发展，现在可以了，那么在这种情况下，如果
other direction okay so in this case if Y is different the path is blocked all

1310
00:51:51,299 --> 00:51:54,799
Y不同，路径被完全阻止，因此球不会返回
other direction okay so in this case if Y is different the path is blocked all

1311
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:56,900
Y不同，路径被完全阻止，因此球不会返回
Y is different the path is blocked all right so the ball doesn't return back

1312
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:56,910
Y不同，路径被完全阻止，因此球不会返回
right so the ball doesn't return back the opposite would interfere

1313
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:58,970
相反会干扰，如果观察到Y，则商场
right so the ball doesn't return back the opposite would interfere

1314
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:02,089
相反会干扰，如果观察到Y，则商场
the opposite would interfere and if Y's are observed the mall

1315
00:52:02,089 --> 00:52:02,099
相反会干扰，如果观察到Y，则商场
and if Y's are observed the mall compartment this way we need something

1316
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:05,839
这样，我们需要一些东西来停止算法点
and if Y's are observed the mall compartment this way we need something

1317
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,789
这样，我们需要一些东西来停止算法点
compartment this way we need something to have to stop the algorithm dot

1318
00:52:07,789 --> 00:52:07,799
这样，我们需要一些东西来停止算法点
to have to stop the algorithm dot something it is listed among the

1319
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:10,579
当我们做一些例子时，它被列在关系中
to have to stop the algorithm dot something it is listed among the

1320
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:12,529
当我们做一些例子时，它被列在关系中
something it is listed among the relationship when we do some examples

1321
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:12,539
当我们做一些例子时，它被列在关系中
relationship when we do some examples remind me to come back on the slide 29

1322
00:52:12,539 --> 00:52:14,690
提醒我回到幻灯片29，这样您就可以看到
relationship when we do some examples remind me to come back on the slide 29

1323
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,729
提醒我回到幻灯片29，这样您就可以看到
remind me to come back on the slide 29 so you can see that through these

1324
00:52:16,729 --> 00:52:16,739
提醒我回到幻灯片29，这样您就可以看到
so you can see that through these boundary conditions actually do make

1325
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:19,009
边界条件实际上确实使教堂还不错，所以这就是我们
so you can see that through these boundary conditions actually do make

1326
00:52:19,009 --> 00:52:30,109
边界条件实际上确实使教堂还不错，所以这就是我们
boundary conditions actually do make Church okay so this is what we were

1327
00:52:30,109 --> 00:52:30,119
边界条件实际上确实使教堂还不错，所以这就是我们
Church okay so this is what we were talking on the previous slide right this

1328
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:35,029
在上一张幻灯片上说的正确，这就是这种情况，所以如果Y
Church okay so this is what we were talking on the previous slide right this

1329
00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:39,140
在上一张幻灯片上说的正确，这就是这种情况，所以如果Y
talking on the previous slide right this is exactly this situation here so if Y

1330
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:39,150
在上一张幻灯片上说的正确，这就是这种情况，所以如果Y
is exactly this situation here so if Y is observable x mark if Y will observe

1331
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,660
是可观察的x标记，如果Y将遵守模型块，那么让我们考虑
is exactly this situation here so if Y is observable x mark if Y will observe

1332
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,450
是可观察的x标记，如果Y将遵守模型块，那么让我们考虑
is observable x mark if Y will observe the model block so let's consider the

1333
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:44,460
是可观察的x标记，如果Y将遵守模型块，那么让我们考虑
the model block so let's consider the following situation we have this V

1334
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:48,079
下面的情况，我们有这个V结构，可以观察到
the model block so let's consider the following situation we have this V

1335
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,839
下面的情况，我们有这个V结构，可以观察到
following situation we have this V structure-wise are observed all right

1336
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:52,849
下面的情况，我们有这个V结构，可以观察到
structure-wise are observed all right don't pay attention to this

1337
00:52:52,849 --> 00:52:54,979
不要注意这是观察到的墙壁，所以如果我发现
structure-wise are observed all right don't pay attention to this

1338
00:52:54,979 --> 00:52:56,900
不要注意这是观察到的墙壁，所以如果我发现
don't pay attention to this the walls are observed so if I found

1339
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:56,910
不要注意这是观察到的墙壁，所以如果我发现
the walls are observed so if I found from it what is going to happen here

1340
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:00,529
从它那里会发生什么
the walls are observed so if I found from it what is going to happen here

1341
00:53:00,529 --> 00:53:03,210
您可以在这种情况下告诉X的em f我们绝对可以肯定的是，答案是否定的。
the walls are observed so if I found from it what is going to happen here

00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:03,220
您可以在这种情况下告诉X的em f我们绝对可以肯定的是，答案是否定的。


1343
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:17,420
您可以在这种情况下告诉X的em f我们绝对可以肯定的是，答案是否定的。
you can tell em f of X in this case we're more definitely the answer is no

1344
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:17,430
您可以在这种情况下告诉X的em f我们绝对可以肯定的是，答案是否定的。
we're more definitely the answer is no all right this is what okay so the

1345
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:23,280
好吧，这是好的，所以罂粟花吹了，但是让我们考虑一下
we're more definitely the answer is no all right this is what okay so the

1346
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,890
好吧，这是好的，所以罂粟花吹了，但是让我们考虑一下
all right this is what okay so the poppies blow however let's consider how

1347
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:25,900
好吧，这是好的，所以罂粟花吹了，但是让我们考虑一下
poppies blow however let's consider how many K Y is not observed but let's say

1348
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:31,069
没有观察到许多KY，但可以说它是Y的子代或

it's children of Y or some noise in the presentation of eyes observe then with

1351
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:38,190
眼神的表现然后观察，如果有同谋，那么宗教就是为什么
it's children of Y or some noise in the presentation of eyes observe then with

1352
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:43,670
眼神的表现然后观察，如果有同谋，那么宗教就是为什么
presentation of eyes observe then with if accomplice so religion is why the

1353
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:43,680
眼神的表现然后观察，如果有同谋，那么宗教就是为什么
if accomplice so religion is why the Magnaflow but now what you seen desired

1354
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,170
Magnaflow，但现在您所看到的是想要的，然后在a和a重的情况下会发生什么
if accomplice so religion is why the Magnaflow but now what you seen desired

因此，当您观察现场直播（如果不是X投票）时，您可以达到


1370
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:20,920
因此，当您观察现场直播（如果不是X投票）时，您可以达到
so when you observe live right if it's not vote for X you can reach you can

1371
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:20,930
因此，当您观察现场直播（如果不是X投票）时，您可以达到
not vote for X you can reach you can reach Z okay so this is a tricky

situation all right to you when you have this

1375
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,000
当您进行此重组时，对您来说没什么问题，这说明了您
situation all right to you when you have this

1376
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,670
当您进行此重组时，对您来说没什么问题，这说明了您
all right to you when you have this restructure this explaining away and you

1377
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:33,680
当您进行此重组时，对您来说没什么问题，这说明了您
restructure this explaining away and you have something here an observation we

1378
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,240
这里有一些观察，我们从Y的孩子那里得到了证据
restructure this explaining away and you have something here an observation we

1379
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,350
这里有一些观察，我们从Y的孩子那里得到了证据
have something here an observation we have evidence from the children of Y

1380
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:40,360
这里有一些观察，我们从Y的孩子那里得到了证据
have evidence from the children of Y pretty effectively the same as having

1381
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,660
实际上与对Y本身进行观察相同，因为
have evidence from the children of Y pretty effectively the same as having

1382
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:47,230
实际上与对Y本身进行观察相同，因为
pretty effectively the same as having observations on Y itself because

1383
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:47,240
实际上与对Y本身进行观察相同，因为
observations on Y itself because basically this unlocks the path from X

1384
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,720
基本上，这可以解锁从X到Z的路径，所以让我们写一下
observations on Y itself because basically this unlocks the path from X

1385
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,340
基本上，这可以解锁从X到Z的路径，所以让我们写一下
basically this unlocks the path from X to Z all right so let's write this and

1386
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:54,350
基本上，这可以解锁从X到Z的路径，所以让我们写一下
to Z all right so let's write this and see that this is not just released but

1387
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:58,150
看到它不仅发布了，而且以某种方式确实有意义，所以让我们
to Z all right so let's write this and see that this is not just released but

1388
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:00,340
看到它不仅发布了，而且以某种方式确实有意义，所以让我们
see that this is not just released but somehow they do make sense so let's

1389
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:00,350
看到它不仅发布了，而且以某种方式确实有意义，所以让我们
somehow they do make sense so let's start with the most trivial case so

1390
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:03,520
从最琐碎的情况开始，所以我们要唱这首好歌
somehow they do make sense so let's start with the most trivial case so

1391
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,490
从最琐碎的情况开始，所以我们要唱这首好歌
start with the most trivial case so we're going to take this alright song

1392
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:05,500
从最琐碎的情况开始，所以我们要唱这首好歌
we're going to take this alright song writing my dissolution Direction Y and

1393
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,280
在给定Z的XP的情况下，写出我的溶出方向Y和VST效果py
we're going to take this alright song writing my dissolution Direction Y and

1394
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,670
在给定Z的XP的情况下，写出我的溶出方向Y和VST效果py
writing my dissolution Direction Y and VST effects py given X P of Z given Y

1395
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:12,680
在给定Z的XP的情况下，写出我的溶出方向Y和VST效果py
VST effects py given X P of Z given Y all right so all right so we condition

1396
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:19,150
好吧，好吧，所以我们以Y为条件，如果我是Y的证据，那么接下来
VST effects py given X P of Z given Y all right so all right so we condition

1397
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:24,640
好吧，好吧，所以我们以Y为条件，如果我是Y的证据，那么接下来
all right so all right so we condition on Y so next if I am evidence of Y what

1398
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:24,650
好吧，好吧，所以我们以Y为条件，如果我是Y的证据，那么接下来
on Y so next if I am evidence of Y what happens between X and Z and I'm just

1399
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:28,120
发生在X和Z之间，我只是在用分子的知识
on Y so next if I am evidence of Y what happens between X and Z and I'm just

1400
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,120
发生在X和Z之间，我只是在用分子的知识
happens between X and Z and I'm just using you know from the numerator little

1401
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:31,130
发生在X和Z之间，我只是在用分子的知识
using you know from the numerator little bit of XY and Z and denominator

1402
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,950
XY和Z的位以及分母确信Y这是x和y的P
using you know from the numerator little bit of XY and Z and denominator

1403
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:36,250
XY和Z的位以及分母确信Y这是x和y的P
bit of XY and Z and denominator convinced of Y this is P of x and y so

1404
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:36,260
XY和Z的位以及分母确信Y这是x和y的P
convinced of Y this is P of x and y so this is no P of x given Y so you notice

1405
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:39,910
在给定Y的情况下，这不是x的P，因此您会注意到卓越与
convinced of Y this is P of x and y so this is no P of x given Y so you notice

1406
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,560
在给定Y的情况下，这不是x的P，因此您会注意到卓越与
this is no P of x given Y so you notice that excellency become independent of

1407
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:41,570
在给定Y的情况下，这不是x的P，因此您会注意到卓越与
that excellency become independent of given Y right okay so when we have this

1408
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:47,830
给定Y对，所以当我们拥有这个时，您就可以观察到它可以包含
that excellency become independent of given Y right okay so when we have this

1409
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:51,640
给定Y对，所以当我们拥有这个时，您就可以观察到它可以包含
given Y right okay so when we have this you know observed and it can contain

1410
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:51,650
给定Y对，所以当我们拥有这个时，您就可以观察到它可以包含
you know observed and it can contain here had some pain and observe then the

1411
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:55,180
这里有些痛苦，观察然后路径被阻塞，那就是我们知道的
you know observed and it can contain here had some pain and observe then the

1412
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:59,770
这里有些痛苦，观察然后路径被阻塞，那就是我们知道的
here had some pain and observe then the path is blocked and that's we you know

1413
00:55:59,770 --> 00:55:59,780
这里有些痛苦，观察然后路径被阻塞，那就是我们知道的
path is blocked and that's we you know we call this graph separation right and

1414
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:02,650
我们称此图分离为对，它等效于
path is blocked and that's we you know we call this graph separation right and

1415
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,950
我们称此图分离为对，它等效于
we call this graph separation right and it's equivalent to

1416
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:04,960
我们称此图分离为对，它等效于
it's equivalent to this independent simulation would be

1417
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,079
这个独立的模拟将是一个无缝的问题，所以这里的想法是
it's equivalent to this independent simulation would be

1418
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:10,440
这个独立的模拟将是一个无缝的问题，所以这里的想法是
this independent simulation would be seamless a question so the idea here is

1419
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:10,450
这个独立的模拟将是一个无缝的问题，所以这里的想法是
seamless a question so the idea here is rather than having to prove an equation

1420
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,690
而不是必须证明这样的等式，如果您可以证明该音符
seamless a question so the idea here is rather than having to prove an equation

1421
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:16,470
而不是必须证明这样的等式，如果您可以证明该音符
rather than having to prove an equation like that if you can prove that the note

1422
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:16,480
而不是必须证明这样的等式，如果您可以证明该音符
like that if you can prove that the note section Z are not separated all right

1423
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,470
Z部分没有分开，箭头刻度的位置
like that if you can prove that the note section Z are not separated all right

1424
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:21,570
Z部分没有分开，箭头刻度的位置
section Z are not separated all right and the rien tation of the arrow scale

1425
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:21,580
Z部分没有分开，箭头刻度的位置
and the rien tation of the arrow scale don't even make a big difference okay

1426
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:24,349
甚至不要做很大的改变好吧，他会用最大的痣
and the rien tation of the arrow scale don't even make a big difference okay

1427
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:26,550
甚至不要做很大的改变好吧，他会用最大的痣
don't even make a big difference okay stretch he'll use the biggest mole

1428
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:26,560
甚至不要做很大的改变好吧，他会用最大的痣
stretch he'll use the biggest mole algorithm for something from extra

between zero and that part is blocked then excellency are independent even why

1432
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:33,450
那么卓越是独立的，即使为什么Felicia Rizal会提高到
between zero and that part is blocked then excellency are independent even why

1433
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:36,750
那么卓越是独立的，即使为什么Felicia Rizal会提高到
then excellency are independent even why okay Felicia Rizal would it improve to

1434
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:36,760
那么卓越是独立的，即使为什么Felicia Rizal会提高到
okay Felicia Rizal would it improve to check this permission independent spirit

okay you know this is the Michael che all right first folder and it says given

1439
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:51,730
好吧，您知道这是Michael che的第一文件夹，它说给定
all right first folder and it says given X I X I plus 1 is independent of for the

1440
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:55,200
XIXI加1与上一个练习无关
all right first folder and it says given X I X I plus 1 is independent of for the

1441
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,930
XIXI加1与上一个练习无关
X I X I plus 1 is independent of for the previous exercise right this the

1442
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:57,940
XIXI加1与上一个练习无关
previous exercise right this the first-order Markov chain can give me an

1443
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,349
一阶马尔可夫链可以通过使用
previous exercise right this the first-order Markov chain can give me an

1444
00:57:01,349 --> 00:57:04,170
一阶马尔可夫链可以通过使用
first-order Markov chain can give me an argument of this being through using the

1445
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:04,180
一阶马尔可夫链可以通过使用
argument of this being through using the separation however going to stop this

1446
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:07,680
分离但是要阻止这个，这就是你知道的，所以我们说
argument of this being through using the separation however going to stop this

1447
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:16,290
分离但是要阻止这个，这就是你知道的，所以我们说
separation however going to stop this that this is you know so let's say in

1448
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:16,300
分离但是要阻止这个，这就是你知道的，所以我们说
that this is you know so let's say in this case x-rays the evidence for my

1449
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:20,250
这个案例会为我的眼睛提供X光证据3然后我说，基本上
that this is you know so let's say in this case x-rays the evidence for my

1450
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:23,609
这个案例会为我的眼睛提供X光证据3然后我说，基本上
this case x-rays the evidence for my eyes 3 then I say that basically what we

1451
00:57:23,609 --> 00:57:23,619
这个案例会为我的眼睛提供X光证据3然后我说，基本上
eyes 3 then I say that basically what we need to prove is to let's say that X for

1452
00:57:23,619 --> 00:57:25,950
需要证明的是，在最终案文1中，假设X代表所有正确的漏洞利用
eyes 3 then I say that basically what we need to prove is to let's say that X for

1453
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:31,230
需要证明的是，在最终案文1中，假设X代表所有正确的漏洞利用
need to prove is to let's say that X for all right exploits in the final text 1

1454
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:32,240
你实际上你知道的很好，所以这是正确的证据，所以我们改善了
need to prove is to let's say that X for all right exploits in the final text 1

1455
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:32,250
你实际上你知道的很好，所以这是正确的证据，所以我们改善了


1456
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:37,800
你实际上你知道的很好，所以这是正确的证据，所以我们改善了
you actually you know so okay so this is the evidence right so we improve our

1457
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:37,810
你实际上你知道的很好，所以这是正确的证据，所以我们改善了
the evidence right so we improve our exports in defender of x2 and x1 Topshop

1458
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:42,089
x2和x1 Topshop防御者的出口，您将如何饮用这种饮料？
the evidence right so we improve our exports in defender of x2 and x1 Topshop

1459
00:57:42,089 --> 00:57:43,980
x2和x1 Topshop防御者的出口，您将如何饮用这种饮料？
exports in defender of x2 and x1 Topshop are you going to drink this how you

1460
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:43,990
x2和x1 Topshop防御者的出口，您将如何饮用这种饮料？
are you going to drink this how you gonna prove that given explain that

1461
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,720
将证明给定的解释将独立的效果导出到没有
are you going to drink this how you gonna prove that given explain that

1462
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,260
将证明给定的解释将独立的效果导出到没有
gonna prove that given explain that exports independent effects to without

做任何计算
exports independent effects to without doing any calculations

1465
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,070
但删除使战争发怒的算法
exports independent effects to without doing any calculations

1466
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:55,080
但删除使战争发怒的算法


1467
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:59,990
但删除使战争发怒的算法
but remove the algorithm that makes war angry

1468
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:02,470
所以我们在这种情况下用箭头杀死了什么情况，不是，这是
but remove the algorithm that makes war angry

1469
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:02,480
所以我们在这种情况下用箭头杀死了什么情况，不是，这是


1470
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,520
所以我们在这种情况下用箭头杀死了什么情况，不是，这是
so what situation do we have killed with the arrows in this evidence no this is

1471
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:06,530
所以我们在这种情况下用箭头杀死了什么情况，不是，这是
the arrows in this evidence no this is what Henson tell you all right so if you

1472
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,970
亨森告诉你的一切都很好，所以如果你扔一个球而没有观察到树木
the arrows in this evidence no this is what Henson tell you all right so if you

1473
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:12,660
亨森告诉你的一切都很好，所以如果你扔一个球而没有观察到树木
what Henson tell you all right so if you throw a ball look and no trees observe

1474
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:12,670
亨森告诉你的一切都很好，所以如果你扔一个球而没有观察到树木
throw a ball look and no trees observe what happens when you throw the ball

1475
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:14,800
当您从x264的口袋里丢球时会发生什么事，所以没事吧
throw a ball look and no trees observe what happens when you throw the ball

1476
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:20,980
当您从x264的口袋里丢球时会发生什么事，所以没事吧
what happens when you throw the ball from x264 the pocket no all right so

1477
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:20,990
当您从x264的口袋里丢球时会发生什么事，所以没事吧
from x264 the pocket no all right so it's sports independent XP sing with me

1478
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:24,300
如果我给它加分时，这是与运动无关的XP和我一起唱歌
from x264 the pocket no all right so it's sports independent XP sing with me

1479
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,210
如果我给它加分时，这是与运动无关的XP和我一起唱歌
it's sports independent XP sing with me if I put a little extra on when it rates

1480
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:28,220
如果我给它加分时，这是与运动无关的XP和我一起唱歌
if I put a little extra on when it rates extreme I want to probe in the pencil

1481
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:32,620
极端，我想用X 4的铅笔探测X 1，所以如果我扔了，我们
if I put a little extra on when it rates extreme I want to probe in the pencil

1482
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,510
极端，我想用X 4的铅笔探测X 1，所以如果我扔了，我们
extreme I want to probe in the pencil for X 4 for X 1 so if I throw and we're

1483
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:34,520
极端，我想用X 4的铅笔探测X 1，所以如果我扔了，我们
for X 4 for X 1 so if I throw and we're from extraordinaire its X 3

1484
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,609
来自非凡，它的X 3是，因为没有观察到该节点
for X 4 for X 1 so if I throw and we're from extraordinaire its X 3

1485
00:58:36,609 --> 00:58:39,790
来自非凡，它的X 3是，因为没有观察到该节点
from extraordinaire its X 3 yes because this node is not observe but

1486
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:39,800
来自非凡，它的X 3是，因为没有观察到该节点
yes because this node is not observe but popular tax free

00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,089
大众免税
yes because this node is not observe but popular tax free

1488
00:58:43,089 --> 00:58:43,380
好的，所以现在这个教程示例我认为您认为这是理所当然的，但是您知道
yes because this node is not observe but popular tax free

1489
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:43,390
好的，所以现在这个教程示例我认为您认为这是理所当然的，但是您知道


1490
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:50,380
好的，所以现在这个教程示例我认为您认为这是理所当然的，但是您知道
ok so now this tutorial example I think you take it for granted but you know if

1491
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:50,390
好的，所以现在这个教程示例我认为您认为这是理所当然的，但是您知道
you take it for granted but you know if I start making fancy connections between

1492
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,780
我开始在规范先生之间建立花哨的联系，这是非常简单的算法，
you take it for granted but you know if I start making fancy connections between

1493
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,900
我开始在规范先生之间建立花哨的联系，这是非常简单的算法，
I start making fancy connections between the norms mister very easy algorithm to

反对假设给你一个平台工作来做这个事情好吧，所以所有
against assuming to give you a platform work to work on this thing okay so all

1500
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:06,980
反对假设给你一个平台工作来做这个事情好吧，所以所有
work to work on this thing okay so all right an issue because it's sort of an

1501
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:09,430
解决一个问题，因为这是再次执行此操作的一种重要方式
work to work on this thing okay so all right an issue because it's sort of an

1502
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:16,780
解决一个问题，因为这是再次执行此操作的一种重要方式
right an issue because it's sort of an important way of doing this ok again

1503
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:16,790
解决一个问题，因为这是再次执行此操作的一种重要方式
important way of doing this ok again showing in this case with a dispatcher

1504
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:19,329
在这种情况下显示的是调度员右尾并观察
important way of doing this ok again showing in this case with a dispatcher

1505
00:59:19,329 --> 00:59:24,910
在这种情况下显示的是调度员右尾并观察
showing in this case with a dispatcher right with a tail and tail and observe

1506
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:28,960
好吧，不，对不起，好吧，这不是先生
showing in this case with a dispatcher right with a tail and tail and observe

1507
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:28,970
好吧，不，对不起，好吧，这不是先生


1508
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:33,040
好吧，不，对不起，好吧，这不是先生
okay what no I'm sorry it's okay it's not at this time sir

1509
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,050
好吧，不，对不起，好吧，这不是先生
not at this time sir this is this is the four o'clock sir

1510
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,079
这就是这四点钟先生的权利，失败与失败，并遵守
not at this time sir this is this is the four o'clock sir

1511
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:38,290
这就是这四点钟先生的权利，失败与失败，并遵守
this is this is the four o'clock sir rights and fail and fail and observe the

1512
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:38,300
这就是这四点钟先生的权利，失败与失败，并遵守
rights and fail and fail and observe the path is blocked for I didn't observe the

1513
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:42,400
路径被阻塞，因为我没有观察到零件被阻塞好了，所以在这种情况下
rights and fail and fail and observe the path is blocked for I didn't observe the

1514
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,490
路径被阻塞，因为我没有观察到零件被阻塞好了，所以在这种情况下
path is blocked for I didn't observe the part is unblocked okay so in this case

1515
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:45,500
路径被阻塞，因为我没有观察到零件被阻塞好了，所以在这种情况下
part is unblocked okay so in this case of the fourth given why actions they're

1516
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,430
给出了为什么它们是独立动作的第四分之三
part is unblocked okay so in this case of the fourth given why actions they're

1517
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:49,690
给出了为什么它们是独立动作的第四分之三
of the fourth given why actions they're independent

1518
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:49,700
给出了为什么它们是独立动作的第四分之三
independent if why some observe that you know if in

1519
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:55,480
如果为什么有人观察到您知道在这种情况下是否可以看到
independent if why some observe that you know if in

1520
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,829
如果为什么有人观察到您知道在这种情况下是否可以看到
if why some observe that you know if in this case you can see that the

1521
00:59:56,829 --> 00:59:56,839
如果为什么有人观察到您知道在这种情况下是否可以看到
this case you can see that the probability affection see margarine

1522
00:59:56,839 --> 00:59:58,510
概率影响见人造黄油基本上你知道这不等于
this case you can see that the probability affection see margarine

1523
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:02,859
概率影响见人造黄油基本上你知道这不等于
probability affection see margarine basically you know this is not equal to

1524
01:00:02,859 --> 01:00:02,869
概率影响见人造黄油基本上你知道这不等于
basically you know this is not equal to P of X x gives independence

1525
01:00:02,869 --> 01:00:09,040
X x的P给出独立性
basically you know this is not equal to P of X x gives independence

1526
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:13,250
再次，远景，这是我最困难的案件证明书，有两个
basically you know this is not equal to P of X x gives independence

1527
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:13,260
再次，远景，这是我最困难的案件证明书，有两个


1528
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:18,950
再次，远景，这是我最困难的案件证明书，有两个
and again vistas this is the most difficult case certificate I have two

1529
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:18,960
再次，远景，这是我最困难的案件证明书，有两个
difficult case certificate I have two causes of why if the part is blocked

1530
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,510
为什么当y为空时部分被阻塞的原因是
difficult case certificate I have two causes of why if the part is blocked

1531
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,849
为什么当y为空时部分被阻塞的原因是
causes of why if the part is blocked when y is nothing self that's the

1532
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:25,859
为什么当y为空时部分被阻塞的原因是
when y is nothing self that's the opposite from all the previous cases if

1533
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:27,890
与前面所有情况相反，如果在两个方向上都可以观察到Y，则可以行走
when y is nothing self that's the opposite from all the previous cases if

1534
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,630
与前面所有情况相反，如果在两个方向上都可以观察到Y，则可以行走
opposite from all the previous cases if Y is observed in the both can walk

1535
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:29,640
与前面所有情况相反，如果在两个方向上都可以观察到Y，则可以行走
Y is observed in the both can walk through all right

1536
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,720
通过所有的权利
Y is observed in the both can walk through all right

1537
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,730
好吧，所以再次与x和z处于边际的情况相反
Y is observed in the both can walk through all right

1538
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:33,740
好吧，所以再次与x和z处于边际的情况相反


1539
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:40,760
好吧，所以再次与x和z处于边际的情况相反
okay so again goes to its opposite from the other case x and z are marginally

1540
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:40,770
好吧，所以再次与x和z处于边际的情况相反
the other case x and z are marginally independent but you can try to establish

1541
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:42,700
独立的，但您可以尝试建立基本的初始独立性
the other case x and z are marginally independent but you can try to establish

1542
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,700
独立的，但您可以尝试建立基本的初始独立性
independent but you can try to establish basically initial independence given the

1543
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:46,710
独立的，但您可以尝试建立基本的初始独立性
basically initial independence given the evidence Y X is not independent you okay

1544
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:55,130
证据表明YX不是独立的，您还好，我们谈到了
basically initial independence given the evidence Y X is not independent you okay

1545
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:58,940
证据表明YX不是独立的，您还好，我们谈到了
evidence Y X is not independent you okay and we talked about this let's

1546
01:00:58,940 --> 01:00:58,950
证据表明YX不是独立的，您还好，我们谈到了
and we talked about this let's concentrate on this on this example

1547
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:01,970
专注于这个例子，他们需要什么，因为你
and we talked about this let's concentrate on this on this example

1548
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:04,820
专注于这个例子，他们需要什么，因为你
concentrate on this on this example right they need anything because you

1549
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:04,830
专注于这个例子，他们需要什么，因为你
right they need anything because you know I have no idea with the space here

1550
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,530
知道我对这里的空间一无所知，因为我们需要一起思考
right they need anything because you know I have no idea with the space here

1551
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,750
知道我对这里的空间一无所知，因为我们需要一起思考
know I have no idea with the space here okay because we need to think together

1552
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:08,760
知道我对这里的空间一无所知，因为我们需要一起思考
okay because we need to think together here so you can help me as you aspiring

1553
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,859
在这里，因此您可以在有志于在这里发言时为我提供帮助，所以在这种情况下，我可以
okay because we need to think together here so you can help me as you aspiring

1554
01:01:12,859 --> 01:01:15,410
在这里，因此您可以在有志于在这里发言时为我提供帮助，所以在这种情况下，我可以
here so you can help me as you aspiring speaking here so in this case I have

1555
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:15,420
在这里，因此您可以在有志于在这里发言时为我提供帮助，所以在这种情况下，我可以
speaking here so in this case I have nothing observed and I thought well for

1556
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:17,630
没有观察到任何东西，我想的很好，接下来您能告诉我发生了什么步骤吗
speaking here so in this case I have nothing observed and I thought well for

1557
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,700
没有观察到任何东西，我想的很好，接下来您能告诉我发生了什么步骤吗
nothing observed and I thought well for next can you tell me what happens step

1558
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:19,710
没有观察到任何东西，我想的很好，接下来您能告诉我发生了什么步骤吗
next can you tell me what happens step by step and maybe if you don't remember

1559
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,070
分步进行，也许如果您忘记了，我们会回到之前的所有幻灯片
next can you tell me what happens step by step and maybe if you don't remember

1560
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:25,670
分步进行，也许如果您忘记了，我们会回到之前的所有幻灯片
by step and maybe if you don't remember we go back to all the previous slides

1561
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:25,870
来自X，我想看看没有涉及的地方
by step and maybe if you don't remember we go back to all the previous slides

1562
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:25,880
来自X，我想看看没有涉及的地方


1563
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:32,630
来自X，我想看看没有涉及的地方
from from X and I want to see where this not hasn't involved

1564
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:32,640
来自X，我想看看没有涉及的地方
not hasn't involved so what is my extraction phase of the

1565
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,030
所以我的结构提取阶段是什么，所以这是
not hasn't involved so what is my extraction phase of the

1566
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:38,330
所以我的结构提取阶段是什么，所以这是
so what is my extraction phase of the structure all right so this is

1567
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:38,340
所以我的结构提取阶段是什么，所以这是
structure all right so this is unobserved alright so what happens to

1568
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,480
没观察到好，所以两者发生的事情在路径上看起来都很紧张
structure all right so this is unobserved alright so what happens to

1569
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,050
没观察到好，所以两者发生的事情在路径上看起来都很紧张
unobserved alright so what happens to the both look nervous to the to the path

1570
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:45,060
没观察到好，所以两者发生的事情在路径上看起来都很紧张
the both look nervous to the to the path here when I look at the two arrows being

1571
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:48,260
在这里，当我看着像这样向下的两个箭头时
the both look nervous to the to the path here when I look at the two arrows being

1572
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,900
在这里，当我看着像这样向下的两个箭头时
here when I look at the two arrows being down like that

1573
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:55,850
我可以从X移到Y否，因为观察到的情况我可以从X移到W
here when I look at the two arrows being down like that

1574
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:55,860
我可以从X移到Y否，因为观察到的情况我可以从X移到W


1575
01:01:55,860 --> 01:02:05,360
我可以从X移到Y否，因为观察到的情况我可以从X移到W
can I go from X to Y no because those are observed can I move over from X to W

1576
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,120
我可以从X转到W是吗，因为太太。根据观察到的生活的斯泰森故事是
can I go from X to Y no because those are observed can I move over from X to W

1577
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:07,130
我可以从X转到W是吗，因为太太。根据观察到的生活的斯泰森故事是


1578
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:16,490
我可以从X转到W是吗，因为太太。根据观察到的生活的斯泰森故事是
can I go from X to W yeah because mrs. Stetson tale based on observed life is

1579
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:16,500
我可以从X转到W是吗，因为太太。根据观察到的生活的斯泰森故事是
Stetson tale based on observed life is Pakistan block okay then I mixed loudly

1580
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:20,510
巴基斯坦封锁好了，然后我大声混音，音量下降到什么水平
Stetson tale based on observed life is Pakistan block okay then I mixed loudly

1581
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:22,130
巴基斯坦封锁好了，然后我大声混音，音量下降到什么水平
Pakistan block okay then I mixed loudly and what happens to the volume down to

1582
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:22,140
巴基斯坦封锁好了，然后我大声混音，音量下降到什么水平
and what happens to the volume down to you when that me is not observed goes up

1583
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:25,370
当你没有观察到我的时候你会上升，所以球丢了，他们再也不会回来
and what happens to the volume down to you when that me is not observed goes up

1584
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,700
当你没有观察到我的时候你会上升，所以球丢了，他们再也不会回来
you when that me is not observed goes up so the ball is lost they never come back

1585
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:27,710
当你没有观察到我的时候你会上升，所以球丢了，他们再也不会回来
so the ball is lost they never come back okay tell me now what happens when I

1586
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:30,260
好吧，现在告诉我，当我观察到你的时候会发生什么
so the ball is lost they never come back okay tell me now what happens when I

1587
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,890
好吧，现在告诉我，当我观察到你的时候会发生什么
okay tell me now what happens when I observed that me you

1588
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:32,900
好吧，现在告诉我，当我观察到你的时候会发生什么
observed that me you so obviously the volume there all right

1589
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:37,000
所以很明显那里的音量很好，你知道我们什么也没说
observed that me you so obviously the volume there all right

1590
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,940
所以很明显那里的音量很好，你知道我们什么也没说
so obviously the volume there all right you know we don't say anything

1591
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:39,950
所以很明显那里的音量很好，你知道我们什么也没说
you know we don't say anything stimulus situation so the ball comes

1592
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:42,200
刺激的情况，所以球来了好了，从零开始会发生什么
you know we don't say anything stimulus situation so the ball comes

1593
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:46,480
刺激的情况，所以球来了好了，从零开始会发生什么
stimulus situation so the ball comes here okay what happens this from zero

1594
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:46,490
刺激的情况，所以球来了好了，从零开始会发生什么
here okay what happens this from zero from our bounding conditions the mall

1595
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:48,800
从我们的边界条件来看，购物中心回来了，然后观察到
here okay what happens this from zero from our bounding conditions the mall

1596
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,350
从我们的边界条件来看，购物中心回来了，然后观察到
from our bounding conditions the mall comes back and then this one observed

1597
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:51,360
从我们的边界条件来看，购物中心回来了，然后观察到
comes back and then this one observed the wall was too wide to here

1598
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:55,070
墙太宽了，在这里给定W，关于x和y我们能说什么
comes back and then this one observed the wall was too wide to here

1599
01:02:55,070 --> 01:03:00,260
墙太宽了，在这里给定W，关于x和y我们能说什么
the wall was too wide to here what can we say about x and y given W

1600
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,900
所以我们有这个RR是分隔的x和y，并且两个列表都可以达到Y
the wall was too wide to here what can we say about x and y given W

1601
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:01,910
所以我们有这个RR是分隔的x和y，并且两个列表都可以达到Y


1602
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:09,730
所以我们有这个RR是分隔的x和y，并且两个列表都可以达到Y
so we have this RR is the x and y in the separated and both the list can reach Y

1603
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:09,740
所以我们有这个RR是分隔的x和y，并且两个列表都可以达到Y
separated and both the list can reach Y so what can you tell me when that B is

1604
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:12,250
所以你能告诉我什么时候观察到B，以便明年
separated and both the list can reach Y so what can you tell me when that B is

1605
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:19,420
所以你能告诉我什么时候观察到B，以便明年
so what can you tell me when that B is observed so in order for next year it's

1606
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:19,430
所以你能告诉我什么时候观察到B，以便明年
observed so in order for next year it's Y all right so this is the Ritz ability

1607
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:22,150
是的，所以这是丽兹能力条件，所以烦人的W或多或少
observed so in order for next year it's Y all right so this is the Ritz ability

1608
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:28,300
是的，所以这是丽兹能力条件，所以烦人的W或多或少
Y all right so this is the Ritz ability condition so annoying W is more or less

1609
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:28,310
是的，所以这是丽兹能力条件，所以烦人的W或多或少
condition so annoying W is more or less the same as knowing easy and you can

1610
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:31,540
就像了解简单一样，您可以从析构函数中记住
condition so annoying W is more or less the same as knowing easy and you can

1611
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,100
就像了解简单一样，您可以从析构函数中记住
the same as knowing easy and you can remember from the destructor

1612
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:33,110
就像了解简单一样，您可以从析构函数中记住
remember from the destructor knowing this the evidence makes notes x

1613
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:35,650
知道这一证据后，便会记录x和y，从而使它们具有从属权利
remember from the destructor knowing this the evidence makes notes x

1614
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:42,610
知道这一证据后，便会记录x和y，从而使它们具有从属权利
knowing this the evidence makes notes x and y what makes them dependent right

1615
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:42,620
知道这一证据后，便会记录x和y，从而使它们具有从属权利
and y what makes them dependent right because anything we say about X or Y

1616
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:45,880
因为我们所说的关于X或Y的任何内容都暗示着关于瑜伽的某些知识
and y what makes them dependent right because anything we say about X or Y

1617
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,340
因为我们所说的关于X或Y的任何内容都暗示着关于瑜伽的某些知识
because anything we say about X or Y imply something about yoga okay

1618
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:48,350
因为我们所说的关于X或Y的任何内容都暗示着关于瑜伽的某些知识
imply something about yoga okay all right so here the take apart is any

1619
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:52,060
好的，所以这里值得一提的是您从中获得的任何信息
imply something about yoga okay all right so here the take apart is any

1620
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,620
好的，所以这里值得一提的是您从中获得的任何信息
all right so here the take apart is any information that you get down from

1621
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:53,630
好的，所以这里值得一提的是您从中获得的任何信息
information that you get down from chamber is basically four five eighths

1622
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:55,840
分庭基本上是四个五分之八点半，这是棘手的部分
information that you get down from chamber is basically four five eighths

1623
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,310
分庭基本上是四个五分之八点半，这是棘手的部分
chamber is basically four five eighths half points and this is the tricky part

1624
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:57,320
分庭基本上是四个五分之八点半，这是棘手的部分
half points and this is the tricky part for this graphs

1625
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,010
对于这个图
half points and this is the tricky part for this graphs

1626
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:07,650
我知道，但是这个想法是对的，我们正尝试让您知道有趣的时候
half points and this is the tricky part for this graphs

1627
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:07,660
我知道，但是这个想法是对的，我们正尝试让您知道有趣的时候


1628
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:13,920
我知道，但是这个想法是对的，我们正尝试让您知道有趣的时候
I know but the idea is right we're trying to see you know when interesting

1629
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:13,930
我知道，但是这个想法是对的，我们正尝试让您知道有趣的时候
trying to see you know when interesting to go back from X to X right there is

1630
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:15,750
从X返回X的右边，你知道我们要坚持它的
trying to see you know when interesting to go back from X to X right there is

1631
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,610
从X返回X的右边，你知道我们要坚持它的
to go back from X to X right there is you know we want to stick its the

1632
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:17,620
从X返回X的右边，你知道我们要坚持它的
you know we want to stick its the volcano rich wife Theresa part ever

1633
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:20,930
火山富婆特蕾莎（Theresa part）永远没有粉红猪小妹（Peppa）好吗
you know we want to stick its the volcano rich wife Theresa part ever

1634
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:26,010
火山富婆特蕾莎（Theresa part）永远没有粉红猪小妹（Peppa）好吗
volcano rich wife Theresa part ever no Peppa okay

1635
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:29,920
如果您的目标保持不变，这是您阅读的一个示例，这是
volcano rich wife Theresa part ever no Peppa okay

1636
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:29,930
如果您的目标保持不变，这是您阅读的一个示例，这是


1637
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:36,880
如果您的目标保持不变，这是您阅读的一个示例，这是
this is an example that you read if your target stays the same things and this is

1638
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:36,890
如果您的目标保持不变，这是您阅读的一个示例，这是
target stays the same things and this is a very nice example from Bishop's book

1639
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:39,310
Bishop的书中的一个非常好的例子，实际上是关于
target stays the same things and this is a very nice example from Bishop's book

1640
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:43,599
Bishop的书中的一个非常好的例子，实际上是关于
a very nice example from Bishop's book actually about buzzes compilations for

1641
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:43,609
Bishop的书中的一个非常好的例子，实际上是关于
actually about buzzes compilations for this explaining away paste okay so I

1642
01:04:43,609 --> 01:04:47,079
这个解释消失了，好吧，所以我记得我遍历了所有答案文胸
actually about buzzes compilations for this explaining away paste okay so I

1643
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:51,430
这个解释消失了，好吧，所以我记得我遍历了所有答案文胸
this explaining away paste okay so I remember I go through all the answer bra

1644
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:51,440
这个解释消失了，好吧，所以我记得我遍历了所有答案文胸
remember I go through all the answer bra and I believe I'm not sure but I think

1645
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,859
我相信我不确定，但我认为他们以前的Chrome作品之一
remember I go through all the answer bra and I believe I'm not sure but I think

1646
01:04:53,859 --> 01:04:55,359
我相信我不确定，但我认为他们以前的Chrome作品之一
and I believe I'm not sure but I think one of their former chrome works has

1647
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:55,369
我相信我不确定，但我认为他们以前的Chrome作品之一
one of their former chrome works has this something like this okay so there

1648
01:04:55,369 --> 01:04:59,530
这样的事情还可以，所以以前有个问题，但是肯定可以
one of their former chrome works has this something like this okay so there

1649
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:03,370
这样的事情还可以，所以以前有个问题，但是肯定可以
this something like this okay so there is a former problem but so certainly do

1650
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:03,380
这样的事情还可以，所以以前有个问题，但是肯定可以
is a former problem but so certainly do this homework and when we see the

1651
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,050
这个作业，当我们看到代数代数时，他们在这里说
is a former problem but so certainly do this homework and when we see the

1652
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:08,680
这个作业，当我们看到代数代数时，他们在这里说
this homework and when we see the algebra algebra they say here in wrote

1653
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:08,690
这个作业，当我们看到代数代数时，他们在这里说
algebra algebra they say here in wrote you've got zero point 1 1 1 then 0 1 1 1

1654
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:12,609
您得到零点1 1 1然后是0 1 1 1，因为您会感激不尽
algebra algebra they say here in wrote you've got zero point 1 1 1 then 0 1 1 1

1655
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:14,200
您得到零点1 1 1然后是0 1 1 1，因为您会感激不尽
you've got zero point 1 1 1 then 0 1 1 1 because you will appreciate

1656
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:14,210
您得到零点1 1 1然后是0 1 1 1，因为您会感激不尽
because you will appreciate but this numbers is not magic right

1657
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,599
但是这个数字不是魔术，基本上不会因此而变得
because you will appreciate but this numbers is not magic right

1658
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:19,870
但是这个数字不是魔术，基本上不会因此而变得
but this numbers is not magic right there's not become basically by this

1659
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:19,880
但是这个数字不是魔术，基本上不会因此而变得
there's not become basically by this condition of of abilities that we assume

1660
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,880
能力的条件，我们假设它们是已知的，并且这个先验还可以，所以当
there's not become basically by this condition of of abilities that we assume

1661
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,849
能力的条件，我们假设它们是已知的，并且这个先验还可以，所以当
condition of of abilities that we assume them known and this prior okay so when

1662
01:05:24,849 --> 01:05:24,859
能力的条件，我们假设它们是已知的，并且这个先验还可以，所以当
them known and this prior okay so when you do this algebra so in this case it's

1663
01:05:24,859 --> 01:05:27,700
你做这个代数，所以在这种情况下，基本上是相同的例子
them known and this prior okay so when you do this algebra so in this case it's

1664
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,589
你做这个代数，所以在这种情况下，基本上是相同的例子
you do this algebra so in this case it's basically to the same example that we

1665
01:05:29,589 --> 01:05:29,599
你做这个代数，所以在这种情况下，基本上是相同的例子
basically to the same example that we will discuss in with the rain case

1666
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,480
将会与下雨情况进行讨论，所以知道这是0
basically to the same example that we will discuss in with the rain case

1667
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:35,050
将会与下雨情况进行讨论，所以知道这是0
will discuss in with the rain case alright so knowing that this is 0

1668
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:35,060
将会与下雨情况进行讨论，所以知道这是0
alright so knowing that this is 0 somehow saying something about B

1669
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:37,349
以某种方式说出有关B的信息会产生这种可能性
alright so knowing that this is 0 somehow saying something about B

1670
01:05:37,349 --> 01:05:39,730
以某种方式说出有关B的信息会产生这种可能性
somehow saying something about B produces the probability that this left

1671
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:39,740
以某种方式说出有关B的信息会产生这种可能性
produces the probability that this left is 0 all right since we explained the

1672
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:43,930
是0，因为我们解释了我从Z收到的观察
produces the probability that this left is 0 all right since we explained the

1673
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:47,740
是0，因为我们解释了我从Z收到的观察
is 0 all right since we explained the observation that I receive from Z this

1674
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:47,750
是0，因为我们解释了我从Z收到的观察
observation that I receive from Z this is a very nice example please

1675
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:50,140
这是一个很好的例子，请缠绕并进行计算
observation that I receive from Z this is a very nice example please

1676
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:55,390
这是一个很好的例子，请缠绕并进行计算
is a very nice example please winded and do that calculation okay

1677
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:55,800
你能用最大的米兰作品告诉我，他们甚至有权利像我一样吗？
is a very nice example please winded and do that calculation okay

1678
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:55,810
你能用最大的米兰作品告诉我，他们甚至有权利像我一样吗？


1679
01:05:55,810 --> 01:06:03,750
你能用最大的米兰作品告诉我，他们甚至有权利像我一样吗？
can you show me with the biggest Milan written that they even have right as my

1680
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:03,760
你能用最大的米兰作品告诉我，他们甚至有权利像我一样吗？
written that they even have right as my evidence is independent of B given a

1681
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,270
证据独立于B，告诉我您将如何处理
written that they even have right as my evidence is independent of B given a

1682
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:08,310
证据独立于B，告诉我您将如何处理
evidence is independent of B given a tell me what you will do with the

1683
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:08,320
证据独立于B，告诉我您将如何处理
tell me what you will do with the biggest ball algorithm

1684
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:11,430
最大球算法
tell me what you will do with the biggest ball algorithm

1685
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:16,060
太可怕了，我跌倒了我无法达到的规则，如果这是真的，那么先生。
tell me what you will do with the biggest ball algorithm

1686
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:16,070
太可怕了，我跌倒了我无法达到的规则，如果这是真的，那么先生。


1687
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:23,350
太可怕了，我跌倒了我无法达到的规则，如果这是真的，那么先生。
so terrible I fell beyond the rules can I reach and if this is true right mr.

1688
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:23,360
太可怕了，我跌倒了我无法达到的规则，如果这是真的，那么先生。
I reach and if this is true right mr. Sanford the ball is blocked right so no

1689
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,930
Sanford球被挡住了，所以没有迫不及待，因为我们相信我们不能
I reach and if this is true right mr. Sanford the ball is blocked right so no

1690
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:28,720
Sanford球被挡住了，所以没有迫不及待，因为我们相信我们不能
Sanford the ball is blocked right so no no wait because we believe we cannot

1691
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:28,730
Sanford球被挡住了，所以没有迫不及待，因为我们相信我们不能
no wait because we believe we cannot think it's like eating and blind being

1692
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:31,480
认为这就像吃饭和瞎子对吧哦，当您检查手机时
no wait because we believe we cannot think it's like eating and blind being

1693
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:35,290
认为这就像吃饭和瞎子对吧哦，当您检查手机时
think it's like eating and blind being right Oh checking your phone when you

1694
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:35,300
认为这就像吃饭和瞎子对吧哦，当您检查手机时
right Oh checking your phone when you walk and then you expect me to pay

1695
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,540
走，然后你希望我也对你注意同一件事
right Oh checking your phone when you walk and then you expect me to pay

1696
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:40,320
走，然后你希望我也对你注意同一件事
walk and then you expect me to pay attention to you right the same thing

1697
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:40,330
走，然后你希望我也对你注意同一件事
attention to you right the same thing so a independent big given up you know

1698
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:47,980
所以一个独立的大人物放弃了，你知道告诉我有关球的事情，所以我喜欢
attention to you right the same thing so a independent big given up you know

1699
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:49,900
所以一个独立的大人物放弃了，你知道告诉我有关球的事情，所以我喜欢
so a independent big given up you know tell me about the ball so I like the

1700
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:49,910
所以一个独立的大人物放弃了，你知道告诉我有关球的事情，所以我喜欢
tell me about the ball so I like the ball I say if I bought from a what

1701
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:51,790
我说如果我从一个球上买到它来时发生了什么，那么我会说
tell me about the ball so I like the ball I say if I bought from a what

1702
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:54,850
我说如果我从一个球上买到它来时发生了什么，那么我会说
ball I say if I bought from a what happens to it when it comes here then

1703
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:54,860
我说如果我从一个球上买到它来时发生了什么，那么我会说
happens to it when it comes here then the whole roll up left alright so the

1704
01:06:54,860 --> 01:07:00,820
整个卷起都向左行，这样电动机就被向右堵住了，因为
happens to it when it comes here then the whole roll up left alright so the

1705
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:06,160
整个卷起都向左行，这样电动机就被向右堵住了，因为
the whole roll up left alright so the motor is blocked right right because

1706
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:06,170
整个卷起都向左行，这样电动机就被向右堵住了，因为
motor is blocked right right because this is unobserved okay so this part is

1707
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:13,120
这是无法观察的，所以这部分被阻止了，但是无论如何我们都验证不是
motor is blocked right right because this is unobserved okay so this part is

1708
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:18,790
这是无法观察的，所以这部分被阻止了，但是无论如何我们都验证不是
this is unobserved okay so this part is blocked but anyways we verify was not

1709
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:18,800
这是无法观察的，所以这部分被阻止了，但是无论如何我们都验证不是
blocked but anyways we verify was not the case and then one goes up there

1710
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,650
的情况，然后一个人在那里，因为这要观察这一部分将
blocked but anyways we verify was not the case and then one goes up there

1711
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:23,410
的情况，然后一个人在那里，因为这要观察这一部分将
the case and then one goes up there because this to observe this part will

1712
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:23,420
的情况，然后一个人在那里，因为这要观察这一部分将
because this to observe this part will also be blocked right so you know but

1713
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:26,350
也被封锁了，所以你知道但不在那里
because this to observe this part will also be blocked right so you know but

1714
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:28,780
也被封锁了，所以你知道但不在那里
also be blocked right so you know but not there

1715
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:34,319
好吧，这是相同的语言或完全相同的不同水域
also be blocked right so you know but not there

1716
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:34,329
好吧，这是相同的语言或完全相同的不同水域


1717
01:07:34,329 --> 01:07:39,569
好吧，这是相同的语言或完全相同的不同水域
okay this is sort of the same language or different waters exactly the same

1718
01:07:39,569 --> 01:07:39,579
好吧，这是相同的语言或完全相同的不同水域
or different waters exactly the same thing okay these are all the rules

1719
01:07:39,579 --> 01:07:45,719
好的，这些都是规则
or different waters exactly the same thing okay these are all the rules

1720
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:48,230
现在您可能会问我为什么幻灯片不流动，因为您有时知道
or different waters exactly the same thing okay these are all the rules

1721
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:48,240
现在您可能会问我为什么幻灯片不流动，因为您有时知道


1722
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:53,030
现在您可能会问我为什么幻灯片不流动，因为您有时知道
now you may ask me why are the slides not liquid because you know sometimes I

1723
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:53,040
现在您可能会问我为什么幻灯片不流动，因为您有时知道
not liquid because you know sometimes I in here let's say 2005 I ride the slide

1724
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:56,510
在这里，假设2005年我骑滑梯而我忘了，那么你有2015年
not liquid because you know sometimes I in here let's say 2005 I ride the slide

1725
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:59,720
在这里，假设2005年我骑滑梯而我忘了，那么你有2015年
in here let's say 2005 I ride the slide and that I forgot and then you have 2015

1726
01:07:59,720 --> 01:07:59,730
在这里，假设2005年我骑滑梯而我忘了，那么你有2015年
and that I forgot and then you have 2015 I prefer something else and and then you

1727
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:02,870
我更喜欢别的东西，然后你得到它没什么，这很好，但是你知道
and that I forgot and then you have 2015 I prefer something else and and then you

1728
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,160
我更喜欢别的东西，然后你得到它没什么，这很好，但是你知道
I prefer something else and and then you get it's nothing it's nice but you know

1729
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:04,170
我更喜欢别的东西，然后你得到它没什么，这很好，但是你知道
get it's nothing it's nice but you know what I like to keep that because when

1730
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:06,650
我喜欢保留的内容是因为当您阅读它们时，您会多放一页
get it's nothing it's nice but you know what I like to keep that because when

1731
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:09,520
我喜欢保留的内容是因为当您阅读它们时，您会多放一页
what I like to keep that because when you read them yes you put an extra page

1732
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:09,530
我喜欢保留的内容是因为当您阅读它们时，您会多放一页
you read them yes you put an extra page but you may get something from the

1733
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:11,690
但您可能会从另一张幻灯片中得到一些东西，似乎是
you read them yes you put an extra page but you may get something from the

1734
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:13,069
但您可能会从另一张幻灯片中得到一些东西，似乎是
but you may get something from the different slide that seems to be the

1735
01:08:13,069 --> 01:08:13,079
但您可能会从另一张幻灯片中得到一些东西，似乎是
different slide that seems to be the same but may have something different

1736
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:15,440
一样，但那里可能有所不同
different slide that seems to be the same but may have something different

1737
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:20,210
一样，但那里可能有所不同
same but may have something different there okay

1738
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:22,740
不要生气，所以在我们之前有一个简单的例子
same but may have something different there okay

1739
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:22,750
不要生气，所以在我们之前有一个简单的例子


1740
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:27,919
不要生气，所以在我们之前有一个简单的例子
don't be pissed so some simple example just before we

1741
01:08:27,919 --> 01:08:27,929
不要生气，所以在我们之前有一个简单的例子
so some simple example just before we finish the election today right we

1742
01:08:27,929 --> 01:08:29,329
今天就完成选举，我们真的必须接受这个
so some simple example just before we finish the election today right we

1743
01:08:29,329 --> 01:08:31,030
今天就完成选举，我们真的必须接受这个
finish the election today right we really have to take this

1744
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:31,040
今天就完成选举，我们真的必须接受这个
really have to take this so this is the proportion if you collect

1745
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:39,309
因此，如果您很少从iid数据中收集数据，那么这就是比例
really have to take this so this is the proportion if you collect

1746
01:08:39,309 --> 01:08:44,450
因此，如果您很少从iid数据中收集数据，那么这就是比例
so this is the proportion if you collect data from iid data with little

1747
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:44,460
因此，如果您很少从iid数据中收集数据，那么这就是比例
data from iid data with little innovation and something new what can be

1748
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:48,470
创新和新事物可能是其他事物，实际上这可能是
data from iid data with little innovation and something new what can be

1749
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:50,689
创新和新事物可能是其他事物，实际上这可能是
innovation and something new what can be something else actually this can be an

1750
01:08:50,689 --> 01:08:50,699
创新和新事物可能是其他事物，实际上这可能是
something else actually this can be an indicator variables no tells you what

1751
01:08:50,699 --> 01:08:52,760
指标变量no告诉您这里的混合中是什么高斯，但是
something else actually this can be an indicator variables no tells you what

1752
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,729
指标变量no告诉您这里的混合中是什么高斯，但是
indicator variables no tells you what Gaussian in a mixture here's but the

1753
01:08:55,729 --> 01:08:55,739
指标变量no告诉您这里的混合中是什么高斯，但是
Gaussian in a mixture here's but the idea here is would you look at the

1754
01:08:55,739 --> 01:08:58,820
这里的想法是你要看看数据的概率，所以所有这些
Gaussian in a mixture here's but the idea here is would you look at the

1755
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:01,760
这里的想法是你要看看数据的概率，所以所有这些
idea here is would you look at the probability of the data so these all the

1756
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:01,770
这里的想法是你要看看数据的概率，所以所有这些
probability of the data so these all the collections of data x1 to xn each of

1757
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:06,919
数据x1至xn的收集这些给您的消费税是
probability of the data so these all the collections of data x1 to xn each of

1758
01:09:06,919 --> 01:09:09,320
数据x1至xn的收集这些给您的消费税是
collections of data x1 to xn each of these the excise given you is

1759
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:09,330
数据x1至xn的收集这些给您的消费税是
these the excise given you is independent alright so this is the iid

1760
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:12,260
独立好吧，所以这是你们在每个
these the excise given you is independent alright so this is the iid

1761
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:14,930
独立好吧，所以这是你们在每个
independent alright so this is the iid assumption that you guys use in every

1762
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:14,940
独立好吧，所以这是你们在每个
assumption that you guys use in every statistics course you pay and the idea

1763
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:21,140
您支付的统计课程，这里的想法是图形表示
assumption that you guys use in every statistics course you pay and the idea

1764
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,660
您支付的统计课程，这里的想法是图形表示
statistics course you pay and the idea here is representation a graphical

1765
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:23,670
您支付的统计课程，这里的想法是图形表示
here is representation a graphical representation of the I I need property

1766
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:26,059
II需求属性的表示形式是带有城市的简单图形，因此可以
here is representation a graphical representation of the I I need property

1767
01:09:26,059 --> 01:09:30,200
II需求属性的表示形式是带有城市的简单图形，因此可以
representation of the I I need property is the simple graph with the city so can

1768
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:30,210
II需求属性的表示形式是带有城市的简单图形，因此可以
is the simple graph with the city so can somebody tell me just you know why this

1769
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:34,490
有人告诉我，你知道为什么这张图基本上发明了这种独立性
is the simple graph with the city so can somebody tell me just you know why this

1770
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:37,519
有人告诉我，你知道为什么这张图基本上发明了这种独立性
somebody tell me just you know why this graph basically invent this independence

1771
01:09:37,519 --> 01:09:37,529
有人告诉我，你知道为什么这张图基本上发明了这种独立性
graph basically invent this independence relation otherwise my x1 is independent

1772
01:09:37,529 --> 01:09:39,769
关系，否则我的x1独立于X 2
graph basically invent this independence relation otherwise my x1 is independent

1773
01:09:39,769 --> 01:09:42,350
关系，否则我的x1独立于X 2
relation otherwise my x1 is independent of X 2

1774
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:48,189
在这种情况下，从x1转到x2的唯一方法是向右的虚线箭头
relation otherwise my x1 is independent of X 2

1775
01:09:48,189 --> 01:09:48,199
在这种情况下，从x1转到x2的唯一方法是向右的虚线箭头


1776
01:09:48,199 --> 01:09:58,300
在这种情况下，从x1转到x2的唯一方法是向右的虚线箭头
what is the only way to go from x1 to x2 in this case the broken arrow right

1777
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:02,700
所以等等我什么时候得到这个
what is the only way to go from x1 to x2 in this case the broken arrow right

1778
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:02,710
所以等等我什么时候得到这个


1779
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:06,420
所以等等我什么时候得到这个
so wait when do I get this

1780
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:21,740
所以不要害怕过山车，因为我的exe是我的约会对象，显然
so wait when do I get this

1781
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:21,750
所以不要害怕过山车，因为我的exe是我的约会对象，显然


1782
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:26,990
所以不要害怕过山车，因为我的exe是我的约会对象，显然
so don't get coaster scared okay because my exes are my date obviously have to

1783
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:27,000
所以不要害怕过山车，因为我的exe是我的约会对象，显然
my exes are my date obviously have to mark them because that's my evidence

1784
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,910
标记它们，因为那是我的证据，但是当我写此关系时，
my exes are my date obviously have to mark them because that's my evidence

1785
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:32,540
标记它们，因为那是我的证据，但是当我写此关系时，
mark them because that's my evidence right but when I write this relation and

1786
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:32,550
标记它们，因为那是我的证据，但是当我写此关系时，
right but when I write this relation and I'm looking at this Malaysian my

1787
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:34,040
我正在从公开演讲中看到这个马来西亚人的证据是什么
right but when I write this relation and I'm looking at this Malaysian my

1788
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,560
我正在从公开演讲中看到这个马来西亚人的证据是什么
I'm looking at this Malaysian my evidence from public speakings what

1789
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:36,570
我正在从公开演讲中看到这个马来西亚人的证据是什么
evidence from public speakings what right you know what variable when I say

1790
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:40,790
对，当我说给定的三个月亮时，你知道什么变量，所以如果我
evidence from public speakings what right you know what variable when I say

1791
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:44,900
对，当我说给定的三个月亮时，你知道什么变量，所以如果我
right you know what variable when I say three of the given moon right so if I

1792
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:44,910
对，当我说给定的三个月亮时，你知道什么变量，所以如果我
three of the given moon right so if I want to welcome x1 to x2 I have to go

1793
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:47,479
要欢迎x1到x2，我必须仔细检查新证据，所以我已经
three of the given moon right so if I want to welcome x1 to x2 I have to go

1794
01:10:47,479 --> 01:10:50,540
要欢迎x1到x2，我必须仔细检查新证据，所以我已经
want to welcome x1 to x2 I have to go through the evidence new alright so I've

1795
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:50,550
要欢迎x1到x2，我必须仔细检查新证据，所以我已经
through the evidence new alright so I've got another 2x2 the path from here is

1796
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:54,380
又得到了2x2，从这里开始的路径被封锁了
through the evidence new alright so I've got another 2x2 the path from here is

1797
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,450
又得到了2x2，从这里开始的路径被封锁了
got another 2x2 the path from here is blocked all right

1798
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:56,460
又得到了2x2，从这里开始的路径被封锁了
blocked all right because I already know the values of me

1799
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,790
因为我已经知道我的价值观，所以您需要开始多年
blocked all right because I already know the values of me

1800
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:03,350
因为我已经知道我的价值观，所以您需要开始多年
because I already know the values of me okay so you need to start get years to

1801
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:03,360
因为我已经知道我的价值观，所以您需要开始多年
okay so you need to start get years to do this little drops basically that

1802
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:08,689
做这些小滴，基本上是因为他们不只是一种假医生
okay so you need to start get years to do this little drops basically that

1803
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:11,390
做这些小滴，基本上是因为他们不只是一种假医生
do this little drops basically that they're not just a sort of dummy doctor

1804
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:11,400
做这些小滴，基本上是因为他们不只是一种假医生
they're not just a sort of dummy doctor relations but they embed from holistic

1805
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,430
关系，但它们是从整体关系中嵌入的，所以本质上讲，当您拥有
they're not just a sort of dummy doctor relations but they embed from holistic

1806
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:17,000
关系，但它们是从整体关系中嵌入的，所以本质上讲，当您拥有
relations but they embed from holistic relationship so in essence when you have

1807
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:17,010
关系，但它们是从整体关系中嵌入的，所以本质上讲，当您拥有
relationship so in essence when you have this graph immediately this is their

1808
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:20,140
这张图立刻是他们的权利，所以它一次都不是另一个
relationship so in essence when you have this graph immediately this is their

1809
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:23,570
这张图立刻是他们的权利，所以它一次都不是另一个
this graph immediately this is their right so it's not one of the other once

1810
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:23,580
这张图立刻是他们的权利，所以它一次都不是另一个
right so it's not one of the other once you plot it this is what immediately you

1811
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,580
您将其绘制出来，这就是您立即暗示您拥有iid的原因
right so it's not one of the other once you plot it this is what immediately you

1812
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,740
您将其绘制出来，这就是您立即暗示您拥有iid的原因
you plot it this is what immediately you are implying that you have the iid

1813
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:27,750
您将其绘制出来，这就是您立即暗示您拥有iid的原因
are implying that you have the iid assumption

1814
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,430
假设还可以，你显然可以知道
are implying that you have the iid assumption

1815
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:32,300
假设还可以，你显然可以知道
assumption okay and you can obviously you know hear

1816
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:32,310
假设还可以，你显然可以知道
okay and you can obviously you know hear that if you might analyze me out all

1817
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:35,360
如果你可以对我进行分析
okay and you can obviously you know hear that if you might analyze me out all

1818
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:35,570
如果你可以对我进行分析
that if you might analyze me out all right

1819
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:35,580
如果你可以对我进行分析
right that marginally basically you can P of

1820
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:38,689
基本上你可以成为我的P
right that marginally basically you can P of

1821
01:11:38,689 --> 01:11:40,550
基本上你可以成为我的P
that marginally basically you can P of me

1822
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:40,560
基本上你可以成为我的P
me it doesn't factor is P of X 1 P of X 2

1823
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,850
它不考虑X的P 1或X 2的P等，所以没有真正的
me it doesn't factor is P of X 1 P of X 2

1824
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:48,320
它不考虑X的P 1或X 2的P等，所以没有真正的
it doesn't factor is P of X 1 P of X 2 etc okay and so there's no really

1825
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:48,330
它不考虑X的P 1或X 2的P等，所以没有真正的
etc okay and so there's no really all right the basically you cannot you

1826
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:53,570
好吧，基本上，你不能，你不能批准任何独立性，所以让我们
etc okay and so there's no really all right the basically you cannot you

1827
01:11:53,570 --> 01:11:57,439
好吧，基本上，你不能，你不能批准任何独立性，所以让我们
all right the basically you cannot you cannot approve any independence so let's

1828
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:57,449
好吧，基本上，你不能，你不能批准任何独立性，所以让我们
cannot approve any independence so let's do

1829
01:11:57,449 --> 01:11:59,660
做
cannot approve any independence so let's do

1830
01:11:59,660 --> 01:11:59,740
再次请那些琐碎的例子之一，让我们来证明这一切
cannot approve any independence so let's do

1831
01:11:59,740 --> 01:11:59,750
再次请那些琐碎的例子之一，让我们来证明这一切


1832
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:04,930
再次请那些琐碎的例子之一，让我们来证明这一切
so again please maybe one of those trivial example so let's prove this all

1833
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:04,940
再次请那些琐碎的例子之一，让我们来证明这一切
trivial example so let's prove this all right so we have evidence x2 and we want

1834
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:08,500
对，所以我们有证据x2，我们想证明两个不同的X
trivial example so let's prove this all right so we have evidence x2 and we want

1835
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,880
对，所以我们有证据x2，我们想证明两个不同的X
right so we have evidence x2 and we want to prove that X for two different

1836
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:09,890
对，所以我们有证据x2，我们想证明两个不同的X
to prove that X for two different effects on an extinct

1837
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:11,440
会影响灭绝，所以请原谅我想要的红色Nestor
to prove that X for two different effects on an extinct

1838
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,950
会影响灭绝，所以请原谅我想要的红色Nestor
effects on an extinct okay so excuse my red Nestor we want to

1839
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:14,960
会影响灭绝，所以请原谅我想要的红色Nestor
okay so excuse my red Nestor we want to say exports in the final factoid exit so

1840
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,860
说出口在最终的拟人出口中，所以使用最大的Mall算法，而不是
okay so excuse my red Nestor we want to say exports in the final factoid exit so

1841
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,780
说出口在最终的拟人出口中，所以使用最大的Mall算法，而不是
say exports in the final factoid exit so with the biggest mall algorithm rather

1842
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:19,790
说出口在最终的拟人出口中，所以使用最大的Mall算法，而不是
with the biggest mall algorithm rather than going to do

1843
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:21,180
而不是去做所有的事情，所以给定X，我们仍然需要
with the biggest mall algorithm rather than going to do

1844
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:23,770
而不是去做所有的事情，所以给定X，我们仍然需要
than going to do all right so given X still we need to

1845
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:23,780
而不是去做所有的事情，所以给定X，我们仍然需要
all right so given X still we need to prove those exports in the panel of X 1

1846
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:26,050
在X 1和X 6面板中证明这些出口，所以我们不要错过X 1证明
all right so given X still we need to prove those exports in the panel of X 1

1847
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:29,710
在X 1和X 6面板中证明这些出口，所以我们不要错过X 1证明
prove those exports in the panel of X 1 and X 6 so let's not miss X 1 the proof

1848
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:29,720
在X 1和X 6面板中证明这些出口，所以我们不要错过X 1证明
and X 6 so let's not miss X 1 the proof independence of export X 1 where your

1849
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:33,070
出口X 1的独立性，您在男孩中的角色可以通过这种方式进行，或者
and X 6 so let's not miss X 1 the proof independence of export X 1 where your

1850
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:35,730
出口X 1的独立性，您在男孩中的角色可以通过这种方式进行，或者
independence of export X 1 where your own role in the boy can go this way or

1851
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:35,740
出口X 1的独立性，您在男孩中的角色可以通过这种方式进行，或者
own role in the boy can go this way or can go all the way like that so if the

1852
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:39,700
可以像这样一直走下去，所以如果球这样走下去，这里发生了什么
own role in the boy can go this way or can go all the way like that so if the

1853
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:42,060
可以像这样一直走下去，所以如果球这样走下去，这里发生了什么
can go all the way like that so if the ball goes this way what happens here

1854
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:42,070
可以像这样一直走下去，所以如果球这样走下去，这里发生了什么
ball goes this way what happens here you know if the world goes this way then

1855
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:45,820
你知道世界是不是这样，所以你知道是的是的
ball goes this way what happens here you know if the world goes this way then

1856
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:51,580
你知道世界是不是这样，所以你知道是的是的
you know if the world goes this way then you know yes yes yes

1857
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:52,200
好吧，你告诉我那里发生了什么
you know if the world goes this way then you know yes yes yes

1858
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:52,210
好吧，你告诉我那里发生了什么


1859
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:57,360
好吧，你告诉我那里发生了什么
well you tell me what happens there

1860
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,629
所以我可以从X个小鸡那里去吗我可以到x2
well you tell me what happens there

1861
01:13:00,629 --> 01:13:00,639
所以我可以从X个小鸡那里去吗我可以到x2


1862
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:08,400
所以我可以从X个小鸡那里去吗我可以到x2
so can I go from X chicks can I go to x2

1863
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:14,699
这样我们就可以知道了
so can I go from X chicks can I go to x2

1864
01:13:14,699 --> 01:13:14,709
这样我们就可以知道了


1865
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:20,310
这样我们就可以知道了
so we can know okay

1866
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:20,450
但请记住下一段文字是我说的不匹配先生的方式
so we can know okay

1867
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:20,460
但请记住下一段文字是我说的不匹配先生的方式


1868
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:27,770
但请记住下一段文字是我说的不匹配先生的方式
but remember next text is the way that I say is a mismatch sir

1869
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:27,780
但请记住下一段文字是我说的不匹配先生的方式
say is a mismatch sir all right so it's not observed it's not

1870
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:30,560
好吧，所以它没有被观察到，它是不可观察的错过
say is a mismatch sir all right so it's not observed it's not

1871
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,350
好吧，所以它没有被观察到，它是不可观察的错过
all right so it's not observed it's not observable missed

1872
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:39,900
如果没有x6观察会发生什么，那就不好了，然后从X到X是正确的
all right so it's not observed it's not observable missed

1873
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:39,910
如果没有x6观察会发生什么，那就不好了，然后从X到X是正确的


1874
01:13:39,910 --> 01:14:04,050
如果没有x6观察会发生什么，那就不好了，然后从X到X是正确的
if x6 is no observe what happens it's no okay and then from X to X is right this

1875
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:04,060
如果没有x6观察会发生什么，那就不好了，然后从X到X是正确的
okay and then from X to X is right this is given and and then I'm working on

1876
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:07,410
被给定，然后我就以这种方式工作，然后就知道了
okay and then from X to X is right this is given and and then I'm working on

1877
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:08,580
被给定，然后我就以这种方式工作，然后就知道了
is given and and then I'm working on this way and then it's you know

1878
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:08,590
被给定，然后我就以这种方式工作，然后就知道了
this way and then it's you know protected too so this is true so you

1879
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:11,760
也受保护，所以这是真的，所以您知道是否要写这种
this way and then it's you know protected too so this is true so you

1880
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,080
也受保护，所以这是真的，所以您知道是否要写这种
protected too so this is true so you know if you write to this sort of this

1881
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:13,090
也受保护，所以这是真的，所以您知道是否要写这种
know if you write to this sort of this calculation with the factorization of

1882
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:16,170
用概率分布的因式分解进行计算
know if you write to this sort of this calculation with the factorization of

1883
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:18,180
用概率分布的因式分解进行计算
calculation with the factorization of the probability distribution it will

1884
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:18,190
用概率分布的因式分解进行计算
the probability distribution it will take you basically half an hour or

1885
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:20,310
基本上要花你半个小时左右
the probability distribution it will take you basically half an hour or

1886
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:21,510
基本上要花你半个小时左右
take you basically half an hour or something

1887
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:21,520
基本上要花你半个小时左右
something if you dress this relationship you do

1888
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,580
如果你打扮这种关系，你做的话，他们可能会因此而迷失，而不必
something if you dress this relationship you do

1889
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:25,950
如果你打扮这种关系，你做的话，他们可能会因此而迷失，而不必
if you dress this relationship you do they may be lost by it you don't have to

1890
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:25,960
如果你打扮这种关系，你做的话，他们可能会因此而迷失，而不必
they may be lost by it you don't have to bother again so let's finish so X 1

1891
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:34,920
再次打扰，让我们结束，以便X 1给X诊所中的指数
they may be lost by it you don't have to bother again so let's finish so X 1

1892
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,630
再次打扰，让我们结束，以便X 1给X诊所中的指数
bother again so let's finish so X 1 given X clinics the exponents in the

1893
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:36,640
再次打扰，让我们结束，以便X 1给X诊所中的指数
given X clinics the exponents in the benefit sticks okay so it's no exponents

1894
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:43,320
好处棒好了，所以在没有固定时间的时候就没有指数了。有两个部分
given X clinics the exponents in the benefit sticks okay so it's no exponents

1895
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,910
好处棒好了，所以在没有固定时间的时候就没有指数了。有两个部分
benefit sticks okay so it's no exponents in the time no fixed is there two parts

1896
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:44,920
好处棒好了，所以在没有固定时间的时候就没有指数了。有两个部分
in the time no fixed is there two parts one part is this way is this parking lot

1897
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:48,740
一部分是这种方式，这是停车场，现在是这部分，是，不在这里
in the time no fixed is there two parts one part is this way is this parking lot

1898
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:56,370
一部分是这种方式，这是停车场，现在是这部分，是，不在这里
one part is this way is this parking lot yes right now is this part yes not here

1899
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:56,380
一部分是这种方式，这是停车场，现在是这部分，是，不在这里
yes right now is this part yes not here it states that given X for Linux state

1900
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:59,540
它指出对于Linux，给定的X状态x2不是独立的极端，因此给定的X
yes right now is this part yes not here it states that given X for Linux state

1901
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:05,430
它指出对于Linux，给定的X状态x2不是独立的极端，因此给定的X
it states that given X for Linux state x2 is not independent extreme so given X

1902
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:05,440
它指出对于Linux，给定的X状态x2不是独立的极端，因此给定的X
x2 is not independent extreme so given X 1 X 6 roll it a little more like this

1903
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,830
1 X 6像这样滚动一点，越能分散注意力
x2 is not independent extreme so given X 1 X 6 roll it a little more like this

1904
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:10,290
1 X 6像这样滚动一点，越能分散注意力
1 X 6 roll it a little more like this the more can walk from this distraction

1905
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:10,300
1 X 6像这样滚动一点，越能分散注意力
the more can walk from this distraction why because this is observed then the

1906
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:13,860
为什么，因为观察到了这一点，所以更多的可以去解释
the more can walk from this distraction why because this is observed then the

1907
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:16,140
为什么，因为观察到了这一点，所以更多的可以去解释
why because this is observed then the more can go there can go to explain

1908
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:16,150
为什么，因为观察到了这一点，所以更多的可以去解释
more can go there can go to explain there is a path so this going the

1909
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:17,730
有一条路，所以这倒退了
more can go there can go to explain there is a path so this going the

1910
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:18,620
有一条路，所以这倒退了
there is a path so this going the backwards

1911
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:18,630
有一条路，所以这倒退了
backwards okay

1912
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:23,660
好的，所以这是必须要了解的最大的模型操作
backwards okay

1913
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:23,670
好的，所以这是必须要了解的最大的模型操作


1914
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:31,140
好的，所以这是必须要了解的最大的模型操作
all right so this is the biggest model thing in action for a must know

1915
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:31,150
好的，所以这是必须要了解的最大的模型操作
thing in action for a must know computation problems okay

1916
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:35,280
计算问题好吧，我只完成144，所以我不
thing in action for a must know computation problems okay

1917
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,400
计算问题好吧，我只完成144，所以我不
computation problems okay let me just finish what's 144 so I don't

1918
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:38,410
计算问题好吧，我只完成144，所以我不
let me just finish what's 144 so I don't know what's my last slide because I had

1919
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:42,230
知道我的最后一张幻灯片是什么，因为我有，我们将从头再来
let me just finish what's 144 so I don't know what's my last slide because I had

1920
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:45,240
知道我的最后一张幻灯片是什么，因为我有，我们将从头再来
know what's my last slide because I had and we're going to come back from on

1921
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:45,250
知道我的最后一张幻灯片是什么，因为我有，我们将从头再来
and we're going to come back from on this would do the slides on Thursday but

1922
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:53,670
这会在星期四做幻灯片，但是我基本上总结了相同的内容
and we're going to come back from on this would do the slides on Thursday but

1923
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:55,350
这会在星期四做幻灯片，但是我基本上总结了相同的内容
this would do the slides on Thursday but I went basically to summarize the same

1924
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:55,360
这会在星期四做幻灯片，但是我基本上总结了相同的内容
I went basically to summarize the same slide that had before for now in

1925
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,450
除了这个当地北部和以前的滑梯
I went basically to summarize the same slide that had before for now in

1926

除了这个当地北部和以前的滑梯
slide that had before for now in addition to this local the northern and

1927
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:00,100
除了这个当地北部和以前的滑梯
addition to this local the northern and lack of property I also put this

1928
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,550
缺乏财产我也把这个减速财产好了，你知道
addition to this local the northern and lack of property I also put this

1929
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:07,440
缺乏财产我也把这个减速财产好了，你知道
lack of property I also put this deceleration property okay you know

1930
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:07,450
缺乏财产我也把这个减速财产好了，你知道
deceleration property okay you know which is you know sort of a graph

1931
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:11,550
您知道这是一种将一组图分离的图论方法
deceleration property okay you know which is you know sort of a graph

1932

01:16:13,950 --> 01:16:13,960
您知道这是一种将一组图分离的图论方法
theoretic way of separating a set of notes a from beginner so main evidence

1934
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,900
注意到一个初学者，所以如果我扔了这个，主要的证据可以说

1935
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,870
注意到一个初学者，所以如果我扔了这个，主要的证据可以说
notes a from beginner so main evidence shall any the say if I throw this

1936
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:18,880
注意到一个初学者，所以如果我扔了这个，主要的证据可以说
shall any the say if I throw this property this global map of property

1937
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,100
财产这是财产生态学的全球地图，这是由
shall any the say if I throw this property this global map of property

1938
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:25,650
财产这是财产生态学的全球地图，这是由
property this global map of property ecology this is an ahkam directed by the

1939
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:25,660
财产这是财产生态学的全球地图，这是由
ecology this is an ahkam directed by the profit division is the order Markov

profit division is the order Markov property and if you can solve the G next

1942
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:32,380
利润除法是订单的马尔可夫性质，如果您可以解决下一个G
property and if you can solve the G next 12 leads to old and then you can

1943
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:35,070
12导致陈旧，然后您实际上可以显示相反的结果，而不是
property and if you can solve the G next 12 leads to old and then you can

1944
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:36,750
12导致陈旧，然后您实际上可以显示相反的结果，而不是
12 leads to old and then you can actually show the opposite which is not

1945
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:36,760
12导致陈旧，然后您实际上可以显示相反的结果，而不是
actually show the opposite which is not trivial but only 12 Nick stingy all of

1946
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,870
琐碎，但只有12个尼克小气，如果可以的话，它们都比较好
actually show the opposite which is not trivial but only 12 Nick stingy all of

1947
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:42,420
琐碎，但只有12个尼克小气，如果可以的话，它们都比较好
trivial but only 12 Nick stingy all of them relatively well if you could put

1948
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:42,430
琐碎，但只有12个尼克小气，如果可以的话，它们都比较好
them relatively well if you could put one you can write the other two okay and

1949
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:45,630
一个你可以写另外两个还可以，你也可以基本上解决家禽问题
them relatively well if you could put one you can write the other two okay and

1950
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:48,810
一个你可以写另外两个还可以，你也可以基本上解决家禽问题
one you can write the other two okay and also you can solve the poultry basically

1951
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:48,820
一个你可以写另外两个还可以，你也可以基本上解决家禽问题
also you can solve the poultry basically lead to the same factorization of the

1952
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:51,180
导致联合分布的相同因式分解，该图是
also you can solve the poultry basically lead to the same factorization of the

1953
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:52,740
导致联合分布的相同因式分解，该图是
lead to the same factorization of the Joint Distribution the graph which is

1954
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:52,750
导致联合分布的相同因式分解，该图是
Joint Distribution the graph which is the relation that you share the body

1955
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:54,980
你分享身体的关系还好，所以你知道
Joint Distribution the graph which is the relation that you share the body

1956
01:16:54,980 --> 01:17:01,110
你分享身体的关系还好，所以你知道
the relation that you share the body okay so this sort of is you know

1957
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:01,120
你分享身体的关系还好，所以你知道
okay so this sort of is you know something easy to remember this is way

1958
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,180
一些容易记住的方法基本上更强大，因为
okay so this sort of is you know something easy to remember this is way

1959
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:05,820
一些容易记住的方法基本上更强大，因为
something easy to remember this is way more powerful basically because in

1960
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:05,830
一些容易记住的方法基本上更强大，因为
more powerful basically because in essence doesn't really even care what

1961
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:08,250
本质上根本不关心非后代将什么倒置
more powerful basically because in essence doesn't really even care what

1962
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,990
本质上根本不关心非后代将什么倒置
essence doesn't really even care what are the non descendants invert the

1963
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:10,000
本质上根本不关心非后代将什么倒置
are the non descendants invert the direction of the arrow says although the

1964
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,210
箭头的方向说，尽管
are the non descendants invert the direction of the arrow says although the

1965
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,850
箭头的方向说，尽管
direction of the arrow says although the numbering of the

1966
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:13,860
箭头的方向说，尽管
numbering of the right so this made separation actually

1967
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:17,520
是的，所以这种分离实际上可以应用于有向和有向
numbering of the right so this made separation actually

1968
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,040
是的，所以这种分离实际上可以应用于有向和有向
right so this made separation actually can be applied to both directed and

1969
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:20,050
是的，所以这种分离实际上可以应用于有向和有向
can be applied to both directed and undirected graphs and it is the way to

1970
01:17:20,050 --> 01:17:22,739
无向图，这是证明条件独立性的方法
can be applied to both directed and undirected graphs and it is the way to

1971
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:24,770
无向图，这是证明条件独立性的方法
undirected graphs and it is the way to prove condition independence to this

1972
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:24,780
无向图，这是证明条件独立性的方法
prove condition independence to this again if you want the top of each of

1973
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:27,149
再次，如果您想要每个这些的顶部，我们正在学习这个，您有

再次，如果您想要每个这些的顶部，我们正在学习这个，您有
these we're learning this this you have shown them at least with examples the

1976
01:17:29,229 --> 01:17:31,889
至少通过示例向他们展示了事实真相很少，而您又
these we're learning this this you have shown them at least with examples the

1977
01:17:31,889 --> 01:17:35,159
至少通过示例向他们展示了事实真相很少，而您又
shown them at least with examples the truth is very few lines and again you

1978
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:35,169
至少通过示例向他们展示了事实真相很少，而您又
truth is very few lines and again you can consult one of the Bible's in in

1979
01:17:35,169 --> 01:17:38,359
可以在社区图形模型中查阅圣经中的其中一项
truth is very few lines and again you can consult one of the Bible's in in
