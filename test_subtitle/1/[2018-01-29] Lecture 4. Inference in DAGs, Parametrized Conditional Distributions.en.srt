1
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:14,520
all right 12:31 I thought 50 and some risking but look thought I think we are

2
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,460
risking but look thought I think we are maybe 10 20 slides residuals from

3
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,680
maybe 10 20 slides residuals from lecture 3 because I'm going to try to

4
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,130
lecture 3 because I'm going to try to cover them sort of part just the

5
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,360
cover them sort of part just the concepts there's nothing really

6
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,390
concepts there's nothing really substantial there and and hopefully in

7
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,760
substantial there and and hopefully in the majority of the lecture today I want

8
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,000
the majority of the lecture today I want to go through some examples of

9
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,260
to go through some examples of parametrized conditional distributions

10
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,660
parametrized conditional distributions right we said the this directed graphs

11
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,950
right we said the this directed graphs are defined with local conditional

12
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,390
are defined with local conditional probability so we need to see how we

13
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,300
probability so we need to see how we parameterize host and then I'll give you

14
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,460
parameterize host and then I'll give you an example a little bit ahead of the

15
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,890
an example a little bit ahead of the schedule here an example of how you

16
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,560
schedule here an example of how you compute the parameters on those

17
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,630
compute the parameters on those conditional distributions given some

18
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,950
conditional distributions given some data the other part I don't think we're

19
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,990
data the other part I don't think we're going to be able to reach it today

20
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,870
going to be able to reach it today it's basically an example so I even will

21
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,880
it's basically an example so I even will cover it on the next use the oral wait

22
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:18,920
cover it on the next use the oral wait until maybe a month or two down the road

23
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:18,930


24
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:26,310
so reminder we have seen three independent relationships for directed

25
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,940
independent relationships for directed graphs basically the most powerful was

26
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,360
graphs basically the most powerful was this constant of this separation based

27
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,050
this constant of this separation based on this biggest ball algorithm or at

28
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:42,490
on this biggest ball algorithm or at least the biggest bone structure rules

29
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:42,500


30
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:49,810
in essence the Talgo a to operate for both directed and undirected graphs for

31
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,400
both directed and undirected graphs for direct blocks we said we have to pay

32
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,240
direct blocks we said we have to pay attention to these B structures the

33
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,700
attention to these B structures the explaining away we have seen this

34
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,310
explaining away we have seen this directed local Markov property and

35
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,480
directed local Markov property and edenal descendants this is the

36
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,770
edenal descendants this is the predecessors and without really any

37
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,490
predecessors and without really any rigorous proof we basically said these

38
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,870
rigorous proof we basically said these relationships are equivalent to each

39
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,000
relationships are equivalent to each other right if you start with one you

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,930
other right if you start with one you can solve the rest and all of them are

41
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,910
can solve the rest and all of them are actually equivalent to a factorization

42
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,110
actually equivalent to a factorization of the Joint Distribution in in over the

43
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,570
of the Joint Distribution in in over the graph that takes this point okay so in

44
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,360
graph that takes this point okay so in in if you remember with this some

45
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,010
in if you remember with this some examples what we started with the

46
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,480
examples what we started with the factorization like this and then we

47
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,270
factorization like this and then we proved this village you remember by

48
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,159
proved this village you remember by doing marginalization and all of these

49
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:45,520
doing marginalization and all of these things the lefty way the idea now is

50
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,590
things the lefty way the idea now is when I'm going to start with this and

51
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,080
when I'm going to start with this and try to prove this you know if this not

52
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,270
try to prove this you know if this not established from the graph then this

53
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,260
established from the graph then this follows and this is what we need okay

54
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,420
follows and this is what we need okay all right

55
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,370
all right so just if you think that sort of you

56
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,969
so just if you think that sort of you have to type of distribution or family

57
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:08,820
have to type of distribution or family of distributions one the family of

58
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,570
of distributions one the family of distributions that factorizes this way

59
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,210
distributions that factorizes this way over the graph and then another family

60
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,640
over the graph and then another family of distributions to satisfies all the

61
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,290
of distributions to satisfies all the independence relations defined by the

62
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,129
independence relations defined by the graph then basically theorem which is

63
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:25,620
graph then basically theorem which is more or less we highlighted says that

64
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,750
more or less we highlighted says that this two distribution formulas are the

65
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,040
this two distribution formulas are the same okay so the distributions the

66
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,840
same okay so the distributions the SUBSCRIBE independence relations the

67
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,310
SUBSCRIBE independence relations the conditional independence relations

68
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,100
conditional independence relations applied by the graph or the

69
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,810
applied by the graph or the distributions of a price of like this

70
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,360
distributions of a price of like this they are basically the two distributions

71
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,689
they are basically the two distributions all the same okay again I'm not gonna be

72
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:50,279
all the same okay again I'm not gonna be repeating things we have discussed so

73
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:56,670
repeating things we have discussed so let me bring some definition I don't

74
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,279
let me bring some definition I don't think we will make enormous use but it

75
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,379
think we will make enormous use but it is something you may come across in the

76
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,629
is something you may come across in the literature so this definition of what is

77
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:08,240
literature so this definition of what is called the re equivalent I standing from

78
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,810
called the re equivalent I standing from independence so I of Z for a given graph

79
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,370
independence so I of Z for a given graph G is the set of all the conditional

80
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,110
G is the set of all the conditional independence statements and called it by

81
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,870
independence statements and called it by the graph what's the definition so for

82
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,540
the graph what's the definition so for example in the previous case let's say

83
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,909
example in the previous case let's say if this were all the relations for this

84
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:27,360
if this were all the relations for this graph then you know I of G R of this

85
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,390
graph then you know I of G R of this relation okay so it's to set or for

86
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,950
relation okay so it's to set or for conditioning in the present statement

87
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,770
conditioning in the present statement and coded by the graph and two blocks we

88
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,890
and coded by the graph and two blocks we call them I equivalent if I of G 1 is

89
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:43,320
call them I equivalent if I of G 1 is equal to I of G 2 and you can show if G

90
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,969
equal to I of G 2 and you can show if G 1 and G 2 have the same undirected

91
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,800
1 and G 2 have the same undirected skeleton and the same set of be

92
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,909
skeleton and the same set of be structures there I equivalent okay so

93
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,680
structures there I equivalent okay so they have the same independence

94
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,790
they have the same independence relations I am only going to process

95
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,820
relations I am only going to process these things that I marked here with red

96
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,260
these things that I marked here with red wine and

97
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:02,270


98
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,950
very important for directed glass it says we can only identify graph

99
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,440
says we can only identify graph structures are equivalent so basically

100
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,120
structures are equivalent so basically if you try to identify I would say the

101
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,490
if you try to identify I would say the directions are closed is it to the left

102
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,260
directions are closed is it to the left or to the right you do not be able to do

103
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,080
or to the right you do not be able to do that okay

104
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,200
that okay and in many ways not to limitation

105
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,570
and in many ways not to limitation basically of the directed glass but then

106
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,550
basically of the directed glass but then there are properties of directly graphs

107
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,670
there are properties of directly graphs that undirected graphs don't have but

108
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,490
that undirected graphs don't have but remember this all right you cannot

109
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,090
remember this all right you cannot identify the structure of directed graph

110
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:44,320
identify the structure of directed graph join this I equivalent okay and here's

111
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,630
join this I equivalent okay and here's another important definition let's say

112
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,200
another important definition let's say we have a distribution P okay and let's

113
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,900
we have a distribution P okay and let's define IFP to be the set of independent

114
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,060
define IFP to be the set of independent of the condition independent statements

115
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,030
of the condition independent statements implied by the distribution P right

116
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,830
implied by the distribution P right nobody situation right not just the

117
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,200
nobody situation right not just the distribution P so the story Sultan

118
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,330
distribution P so the story Sultan conditional independent statements we

119
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,510
conditional independent statements we call those I of P now for a given graph

120
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:12,580
call those I of P now for a given graph G if the I of G is a subset of I of P

121
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,300
G if the I of G is a subset of I of P then we call I agree to be an I map of

122
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,260
then we call I agree to be an I map of the distribution P so in some sense this

123
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,420
the distribution P so in some sense this is the bass work here we can use the

124
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,090
is the bass work here we can use the graph G as a proxy for the distribution

125
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:30,160
graph G as a proxy for the distribution P now what you need to keep in mind here

126
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,940
P now what you need to keep in mind here is that the distribution P may satisfy

127
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,500
is that the distribution P may satisfy additional independent relationships not

128
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,780
additional independent relationships not implied by the ground but every

129
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,340
implied by the ground but every independent relation prime where the

130
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,210
independent relation prime where the graph is satisfied by the distribution P

131
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,280
graph is satisfied by the distribution P ok that's why the idea here is you can

132
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,220
ok that's why the idea here is you can use it as a safe proxy for pin actually

133
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,990
use it as a safe proxy for pin actually I'll show you somewhere I don't know

134
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,540
I'll show you somewhere I don't know what it is a little picture from

135
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,710
what it is a little picture from Bishop's book but effectively treat this

136
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,670
Bishop's book but effectively treat this G as a filter that allows through it

137
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,100
G as a filter that allows through it only the distributions be the satisfy

138
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,500
only the distributions be the satisfy the independence relations implied by

139
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,930
the independence relations implied by the graph okay so if you have a

140
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,360
the graph okay so if you have a distribution without

141
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,160
distribution without doesn't describe independence relations

142
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,530
doesn't describe independence relations of the graph so if this is not satisfied

143
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,290
of the graph so if this is not satisfied then it cannot go through the graph the

144
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,000
then it cannot go through the graph the faculty if you cannot use the graph tool

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,890
faculty if you cannot use the graph tool to represent fertilizer distribution so

146
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:28,870
to represent fertilizer distribution so take an example let's take the discrete

147
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,060
take an example let's take the discrete distribution defined selection of Y I

148
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,880
distribution defined selection of Y I take values 0 and 1 and let's give some

149
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,430
take values 0 and 1 and let's give some values of the joint probability of the

150
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,920
values of the joint probability of the effects and why I am NOT going to do the

151
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,800
effects and why I am NOT going to do the algebra you can it's right here assuming

152
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,610
algebra you can it's right here assuming the calculations are correct right but

153
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,460
the calculations are correct right but it comes up that you can show that V of

154
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,760
it comes up that you can show that V of X to the Y is equal to P of X P of Y so

155
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,150
X to the Y is equal to P of X P of Y so the x and y are marginally independent

156
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:59,350
the x and y are marginally independent all right so the chickens for this

157
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,829
all right so the chickens for this problem is the center don't involve sex

158
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:06,220
problem is the center don't involve sex independent of Y all right no graph here

159
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,350
independent of Y all right no graph here or anything like that right so we have

160
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,630
or anything like that right so we have this distribution and the only

161
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,420
this distribution and the only independence relation you can solve is

162
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,019
independence relation you can solve is is what you see here so high F P is the

163
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:19,510
is what you see here so high F P is the set that only includes X independent of

164
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:24,360
set that only includes X independent of Y now let's consider different graphs

165
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,050
Y now let's consider different graphs and let's see what is I of G for each of

166
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,670
and let's see what is I of G for each of these graphs how many independent

167
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:38,000
these graphs how many independent relations we have here on the left

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,010


169
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,250
this noise exists between x and y nothing so so what is the relation

170
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,650
nothing so so what is the relation between x and y independent y FG is

171
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,090
between x and y independent y FG is include this this type of include 20x

172
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,480
include this this type of include 20x independent Y in this case there is no

173
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,120
independent Y in this case there is no independence relation 0 and this list no

174
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,880
independence relation 0 and this list no offense relation is 0 so the agreement

175
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,290
offense relation is 0 so the agreement made that all paragraphs basically you

176
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,620
made that all paragraphs basically you know they are can be used the surrogates

177
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,010
know they are can be used the surrogates for the distribution P whenever a page

178
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,900
for the distribution P whenever a page has this property

179
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:13,910


180
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,700
all right now can I list some of these three graphs to represent the

181
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:26,510
three graphs to represent the distribution P this of course because it

182
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,640
distribution P this of course because it satisfies the time dependence relation

183
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,480
satisfies the time dependence relation this doesn't require any independence

184
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,400
this doesn't require any independence relation so any distribution will go

185
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,190
relation so any distribution will go through it the distribution people

186
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,410
through it the distribution people especially in additional independence

187
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,810
especially in additional independence relation but that's okay right

188
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,460
relation but that's okay right you will not violate anything in this

189
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,530
you will not violate anything in this graph because this graph gives zero

190
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,400
graph because this graph gives zero independence relations embedded okay the

191
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,340
independence relations embedded okay the same in this case so how can we open

192
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,350
same in this case so how can we open three graphs I 1 I 2 I 3 etc the I of G

193
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,260
three graphs I 1 I 2 I 3 etc the I of G is subset the Phi of P so there are I

194
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,360
is subset the Phi of P so there are I Maps basically of the distribution P

195
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,330
Maps basically of the distribution P alright and if you like a little

196
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,120
alright and if you like a little graphical justification of what I said

197
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,990
graphical justification of what I said before something that we put in red just

198
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,640
before something that we put in red just here but since you can only identify

199
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,000
here but since you can only identify graph tracks or apply equivalent alright

200
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,400
graph tracks or apply equivalent alright so here are our three starter gets

201
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,960
so here are our three starter gets basically three graphs all right

202
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,990
basically three graphs all right and there are you know I not of the

203
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,400
and there are you know I not of the distribution P ok because to blast them

204
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,390
distribution P ok because to blast them satisfy basically the underlying

205
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,740
satisfy basically the underlying independent relations with pikas

206
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,100
independent relations with pikas ok which is this one

207
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,110


208
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:57,220
this doesn't say anything so a parent basically says if this is really formal

209
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,990
basically says if this is really formal language because already we have paid

210
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,510
language because already we have paid leave is ten times if G is and I'm a

211
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,360
leave is ten times if G is and I'm a puppy then people priced according to G

212
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,590
puppy then people priced according to G okay and fertilized according to G

213
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,480
okay and fertilized according to G basically implies this authorization

214
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,760
basically implies this authorization that we have seen up to now and the

215
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,450
that we have seen up to now and the proof is sort of trivial because if you

216
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,540
proof is sort of trivial because if you take the distribution P and you arrange

217
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,270
take the distribution P and you arrange the nodes in topological order using

218
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,020
the nodes in topological order using sort of the product rules of probability

219
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,460
sort of the product rules of probability you can write it as you see on the first

220
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,550
you can write it as you see on the first line or always be sick here and then

221
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,740
line or always be sick here and then these previous notes will be basically

222
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,500
these previous notes will be basically the parent and the known descendants to

223
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,780
the parent and the known descendants to accept the pilot so Z is the non

224
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,930
accept the pilot so Z is the non descendants - the parent and I can write

225
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,290
descendants - the parent and I can write this probability equal to that Y because

226
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,380
this probability equal to that Y because G is an I'm up of P and there is the

227
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:58,360
G is an I'm up of P and there is the proof of the fear all right Z is an IMAP

228
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,830
proof of the fear all right Z is an IMAP of T ok

229
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,010
of T ok then P Papa Hodges according to C so

230
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,110
then P Papa Hodges according to C so basically the idea is if this satisfies

231
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,120
basically the idea is if this satisfies the independence relations implied by

232
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,540
the independence relations implied by the God then peak and fertilized on the

233
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,250
the God then peak and fertilized on the graph the way we have seen it which is

234
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,900
graph the way we have seen it which is this ok so again nothing extraordinary

235
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,360
this ok so again nothing extraordinary we have seen this ten times but the

236
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,780
we have seen this ten times but the first is total four it only requires

237
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,170
first is total four it only requires this property of conditional

238
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,590
this property of conditional independence implied by the graph Z and

239
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,820
independence implied by the graph Z and this is what I have used okay now if you

240
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,250
this is what I have used okay now if you weigh around and I think it may be

241
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,260
weigh around and I think it may be coming in a few slides I won't cover

242
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,519
coming in a few slides I won't cover that but if you want to start with

243
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,949
that but if you want to start with ition that but for a sizzler gratin you

244
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,470
ition that but for a sizzler gratin you want to prove independence relation such

245
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,259
want to prove independence relation such as based equal to that if you can

246
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:51,350
as based equal to that if you can actually do directly by similar to the

247
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,030
actually do directly by similar to the examples we developed three lectures

248
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,879
examples we developed three lectures okay so you can just talk about

249
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:58,910
okay so you can just talk about distribution compute this and then

250
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:05,780
distribution compute this and then Sullivan is equal to that all right this

251
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,549
Sullivan is equal to that all right this is just the example we discussed we have

252
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:09,199
is just the example we discussed we have seen this no need

253
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:16,119
seen this no need okay definition many definitions here

254
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:20,600
okay definition many definitions here nothing really amazing so with the

255
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,720
nothing really amazing so with the current ago being an IMAP for the

256
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,360
current ago being an IMAP for the distribution right so now I will define

257
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,179
distribution right so now I will define it to be a line and a graph is a minimal

258
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:34,759
it to be a line and a graph is a minimal IMAP well if the removal of even a

259
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,829
IMAP well if the removal of even a single edge from the graph when the

260
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:40,850
single edge from the graph when the street not a map of the distribution in

261
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,079
street not a map of the distribution in other ways there is not a step set of Z

262
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:50,900
other ways there is not a step set of Z such that Z prime is an IMAP of P okay

263
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,769
such that Z prime is an IMAP of P okay so that we call it the name a Lima

264
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:55,910
so that we call it the name a Lima alright and the last thing I want to

265
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,129
alright and the last thing I want to define is the Osher this is the graph of

266
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:01,220
define is the Osher this is the graph of was telling you with which is

267
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,540
was telling you with which is pictorially a nice way to think of this

268
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,929
pictorially a nice way to think of this I maps right so the discipline has a

269
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:11,540
I maps right so the discipline has a distribution to pass through all right

270
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,420
distribution to pass through all right when the distribution satisfies the

271
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,210
when the distribution satisfies the independence relations implied by the

272
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,519
independence relations implied by the graph but the distribution P can have

273
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,610
graph but the distribution P can have additional independence relations not

274
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,100
additional independence relations not implied by the graph right but whatever

275
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,169
implied by the graph right but whatever is implied by the graph has to be

276
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:28,850
is implied by the graph has to be satisfied by the distribution otherwise

277
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,960
satisfied by the distribution otherwise this doesn't pass through that's why you

278
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,730
this doesn't pass through that's why you know the concept here is you use this is

279
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,820
know the concept here is you use this is a distribution filter

280
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:42,580
a distribution filter well I tell me bring the last pair

281
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,340
well I tell me bring the last pair another complicated actually concept we

282
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,140
another complicated actually concept we will get with one very fundamental

283
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,630
will get with one very fundamental example so if somebody gives you a

284
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:55,010
example so if somebody gives you a distribution P of many variables can you

285
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,070
distribution P of many variables can you find the directed graph that has exactly

286
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,700
find the directed graph that has exactly the same independent relations condition

287
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,990
the same independent relations condition independent relations as the

288
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,810
independent relations as the distribution P the P is not possible you

289
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,050
distribution P the P is not possible you can write down some winner distribution

290
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,170
can write down some winner distribution with some conditional independence

291
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,199
with some conditional independence relation can you find a graph that is

292
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,710
relation can you find a graph that is basically a perfect map of the

293
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,720
basically a perfect map of the distribution this is what I call a

294
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:28,610
distribution this is what I call a perfect map

295
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:28,620


296
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,090
I mean you can can you appreciate that this type of is a little bit more

297
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,220
this type of is a little bit more difficult problem than before if one is

298
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,190
difficult problem than before if one is you make a graph and you say okay I know

299
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,019
you make a graph and you say okay I know what relations are satisfied

300
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:40,730
what relations are satisfied so I know which distributions which

301
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,310
so I know which distributions which let's find out now you were given a

302
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,919
let's find out now you were given a distribution P and you say can you find

303
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,510
distribution P and you say can you find me a graph that represents the

304
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,370
me a graph that represents the distribution precisely okay so the

305
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,680
distribution precisely okay so the answer is not every distribution has a

306
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,500
answer is not every distribution has a perfect map and a very fundamental

307
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,510
perfect map and a very fundamental example in the literature you will love

308
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,110
example in the literature you will love point many pages devoted actually to

309
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,990
point many pages devoted actually to this example is an example with four

310
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,750
this example is an example with four variables this is the an undirected

311
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,210
variables this is the an undirected version of the graph that satisfies the

312
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,519
version of the graph that satisfies the following relation using dependency

313
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:20,659
following relation using dependency given B and D and this independent of B

314
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:24,289
given B and D and this independent of B given a FC by the way that since the

315
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:26,889
given a FC by the way that since the biggest bottleneck in principle is

316
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:31,490
biggest bottleneck in principle is become interpolation algorithm in in

317
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,680
become interpolation algorithm in in undirected graphs you may want to

318
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,139
undirected graphs you may want to appreciate the path here but when they

319
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:39,769
appreciate the path here but when they are independent given a and T and a and

320
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:41,510
are independent given a and T and a and C are independent given D and B because

321
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,450
C are independent given D and B because in essence the let's say aliens here

322
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,909
in essence the let's say aliens here independent given T and B because the

323
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:48,860
independent given T and B because the path from A to C is blocked if you go

324
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,139
path from A to C is blocked if you go this way call it block if you move out

325
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:57,970
this way call it block if you move out way given D and B okay so the separation

326
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:03,380
way given D and B okay so the separation is really this separation the way we

327
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,779
is really this separation the way we have said in directed graphs but this

328
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:08,500
have said in directed graphs but this undirected graph satisfies this relation

329
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,899
undirected graph satisfies this relation okay this can you pass me that the

330
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:13,580
okay this can you pass me that the biggest one out which basically it

331
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,019
biggest one out which basically it doesn't care care about arrows or

332
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:18,440
doesn't care care about arrows or anything if the you know you give them B

333
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,600
anything if the you know you give them B then this path is blocked then this path

334
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,260
then this path is blocked then this path is blocked

335
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,250
is blocked okay if you're given a and T and you

336
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,899
okay if you're given a and T and you want to go to these the two paths are

337
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,240
want to go to these the two paths are also blocked so this have the relations

338
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,539
also blocked so this have the relations and so you're asking is can I find the

339
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,610
and so you're asking is can I find the directed graph that actually satisfies

340
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,710
directed graph that actually satisfies these two relations

341
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,259
these two relations and this and so here are two examples

342
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:43,729
and this and so here are two examples this examples have despite its two

343
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:51,650
this examples have despite its two relation what do you think

344
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:51,660


345
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,850
I mean you can you know and I would say this actually you spend maybe 10 minutes

346
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,280
this actually you spend maybe 10 minutes to prove if this to the lessons are

347
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,590
to prove if this to the lessons are satisfied by these graphs but just look

348
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,050
satisfied by these graphs but just look at it visually are this two graphs

349
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,490
at it visually are this two graphs basically having the same independent

350
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:09,110
basically having the same independent relation says this undirected graph so

351
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,640
relation says this undirected graph so it says here so let's say this graph

352
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,090
it says here so let's say this graph right which is being dependent on this

353
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,200
right which is being dependent on this graph what is the part of the biggest

354
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,090
graph what is the part of the biggest algorithm of Facebook based independent

355
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,390
algorithm of Facebook based independent of D with no conditioning nothing is

356
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,030
of D with no conditioning nothing is given right here right there's no

357
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:33,020
given right here right there's no evidence so that is no condition and the

358
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,730
evidence so that is no condition and the goal from B to D the only ways to go

359
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:41,780
goal from B to D the only ways to go through there and what is this is the

360
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,810
through there and what is this is the best marks right this is the explaining

361
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,480
best marks right this is the explaining away this time parents basically causes

362
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,900
away this time parents basically causes of the same the factory so basically

363
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,000
of the same the factory so basically since this is not even being their blog

364
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,710
since this is not even being their blog though they are independent okay

365
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,440
though they are independent okay so this relation has nothing to do with

366
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,070
so this relation has nothing to do with any of Austria's similarly BN one does

367
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,360
any of Austria's similarly BN one does not satisfy basically those two

368
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,510
not satisfy basically those two relations so bottom line

369
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,360
relations so bottom line not every distribution has a perfect

370
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,430
not every distribution has a perfect mark okay so don't expect to basically

371
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,320
mark okay so don't expect to basically have a distribution and then sprinkle

372
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,570
have a distribution and then sprinkle the graph that represents it usually you

373
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,900
the graph that represents it usually you start with a graph with some

374
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,450
start with a graph with some mathematical intuition and then you use

375
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,250
mathematical intuition and then you use the graph as a proxy for the

376
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,400
the graph as a proxy for the distributions you want to to work with

377
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,160
distributions you want to to work with it but the idea to do that is if you are

378
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,110
it but the idea to do that is if you are limiting yourself to the distributions

379
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,300
limiting yourself to the distributions of satisfies the properties of our graph

380
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,690
of satisfies the properties of our graph anything else basically

381
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,520
anything else basically working with it's not look like a

382
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,210
working with it's not look like a mathematical model and you are have to

383
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,430
mathematical model and you are have to obey the rules of that model and if the

384
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,750
obey the rules of that model and if the model is wrong you have problems all

385
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,710
model is wrong you have problems all right don't need was to basically

386
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:03,880
right don't need was to basically they're repeating project part so next

387
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:14,180
they're repeating project part so next time go to the limits for today

388
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,190


389
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,070
the lecture is not being posted didn't have time

390
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,150
they have time to have lots of drink my coffee so this is priority number six

391
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:28,630
coffee so this is priority number six okay so you'll be there by later today

392
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640


393
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,500
so inferencing the office effectively means right but we are giving some

394
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,039
means right but we are giving some evidence and we have to estimate some

395
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,350
evidence and we have to estimate some unknown quantities which can be either

396
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,430
unknown quantities which can be either the student variables and and we do lots

397
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,980
the student variables and and we do lots of examples basically hidden variables

398
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,120
of examples basically hidden variables would be one for each data point but

399
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,830
would be one for each data point but also will be lots of static parameters

400
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,390
also will be lots of static parameters like the parameters in the conditional

401
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,029
like the parameters in the conditional distributions that we need just made so

402
00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:01,190
distributions that we need just made so that's an interest problem okay for

403
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,289
that's an interest problem okay for example in hidden Markov models that we

404
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:05,570
example in hidden Markov models that we will spend maybe two lectures to to go

405
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,090
will spend maybe two lectures to to go through the details you just made the

406
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,560
through the details you just made the hidden states if you've given the

407
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:17,060
hidden states if you've given the technology observations okay in for

408
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,310
technology observations okay in for example in disease-causing I'm sorry in

409
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,649
example in disease-causing I'm sorry in in symmetrical applications for example

410
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:25,220
in symmetrical applications for example did you know the some symptoms that the

411
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,830
did you know the some symptoms that the patient has and you are asking what is

412
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,570
patient has and you are asking what is the disease that causes those symptoms

413
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,779
the disease that causes those symptoms okay so it's basically the same thing as

414
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:36,320
okay so it's basically the same thing as in hmm but the variables some of them

415
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,090
in hmm but the variables some of them can be continuous or discrete

416
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,880
can be continuous or discrete so some mixing with state-space models

417
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,450
so some mixing with state-space models may be the case and there's many other

418
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,039
may be the case and there's many other examples as well so the equation that we

419
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,620
examples as well so the equation that we discussed is basically this equation

420
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,720
discussed is basically this equation that you see here and I'm going to do a

421
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,789
that you see here and I'm going to do a very specific example today with

422
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:57,680
very specific example today with discrete variables hopefully before the

423
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,289
discrete variables hopefully before the end of the lecture so you can see this

424
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:01,549
end of the lecture so you can see this equation in action

425
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:04,640
equation in action so here the notation this is the

426
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,010
so here the notation this is the evidence V means visible variable states

427
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,409
evidence V means visible variable states that hidden feet are the static

428
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:12,110
that hidden feet are the static parameters like that the distributions

429
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,040
parameters like that the distributions defining the probability tables

430
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,050


431
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,570
you basically write the Joint Distribution like that and this is the

432
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,820
Distribution like that and this is the evidence and the evidence basically

433
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,100
evidence and the evidence basically requires marginalization over the hidden

434
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,790
requires marginalization over the hidden variables as you see on the bottom and

435
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,560
variables as you see on the bottom and and these are the three examples

436
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,570
and these are the three examples basically that you know or two of the

437
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,750
basically that you know or two of the examples of liberation so this is the

438
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,780
examples of liberation so this is the kind of operations we need to do and you

439
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,270
kind of operations we need to do and you notice here there is a big summation so

440
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,030
notice here there is a big summation so if these variables are hundreds of

441
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,910
if these variables are hundreds of thousands if you need to do this in raft

442
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,550
thousands if you need to do this in raft in a very effective way all right

443
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,950
in a very effective way all right otherwise this calculation would be

444
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,780
otherwise this calculation would be computationally sort of not easy thing

445
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,290
computationally sort of not easy thing to do

446
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,930
to do okay so don't get the impression or the

447
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,930
okay so don't get the impression or the summation and X a yes but let's say it's

448
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,140
summation and X a yes but let's say it's exhales its thousand variables and each

449
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,330
exhales its thousand variables and each of them takes ten values then you're in

450
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:08,800
of them takes ten values then you're in trouble

451
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:18,560
trouble okay sprinkler problem the web graph is

452
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,470
okay sprinkler problem the web graph is the visible variables right so W is the

453
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,430
the visible variables right so W is the variables the hidden variables is let's

454
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,810
variables the hidden variables is let's say in this particular case we're

455
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,310
say in this particular case we're interested to know it the sprinkler is

456
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:40,210
interested to know it the sprinkler is on or okay and they call them here

457
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:44,000
on or okay and they call them here nuisance variables in the sense but I

458
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,070
nuisance variables in the sense but I only want to estimate if the sprinkler

459
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,810
only want to estimate if the sprinkler is all wrong I don't really care about

460
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,110
is all wrong I don't really care about the Claudian array so there are hidden

461
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,880
the Claudian array so there are hidden bottom is listed as I have no interest

462
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,190
bottom is listed as I have no interest to the estimation and if you have no

463
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,780
to the estimation and if you have no interest in estimation you know what you

464
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,140
interest in estimation you know what you need to do with them you need to

465
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,330
need to do with them you need to integrate them out by that's the

466
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:06,650
integrate them out by that's the Bayesian way okay so again this T naught

467
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,360
Bayesian way okay so again this T naught and s they're really hidden variables

468
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,520
and s they're really hidden variables but in this case they only care involved

469
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,340
but in this case they only care involved the sprinkler so this is where there are

470
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,010
the sprinkler so this is where there are called my query or hidden variables this

471
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,830
called my query or hidden variables this again are hidden by was don't care so I

472
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,529
again are hidden by was don't care so I am going to

473
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:21,719
am going to - great them out and you can see the

474
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:25,249
- great them out and you can see the integration out on CNR so when I write

475
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:27,869
integration out on CNR so when I write this the joint probability of s and W

476
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:30,539
this the joint probability of s and W divided by the probability of W you

477
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:34,169
divided by the probability of W you notice in the denominator since I have

478
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:36,289
notice in the denominator since I have the joint of all the variables i

479
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:39,389
the joint of all the variables i marginalize this would be the

480
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,649
marginalize this would be the probability of love you shall have to

481
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:44,599
probability of love you shall have to multi relies on s C and R on the

482
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:48,479
multi relies on s C and R on the numerator this is the join of S&amp;W

483
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:51,239
numerator this is the join of S&amp;W S&amp;W shall have to marginalize with

484
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:53,029
S&amp;W shall have to marginalize with respects to these notions variables

485
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:55,799
respects to these notions variables cloudy and rain and this is what you see

486
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:58,879
cloudy and rain and this is what you see here okay

487
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:02,190
here okay these modernisations you can start off

488
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:07,409
these modernisations you can start off think you know visually at least in the

489
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:11,279
think you know visually at least in the context of discrete variables s as some

490
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,919
context of discrete variables s as some sort of collapsing big tables so you can

491
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,109
sort of collapsing big tables so you can take care if you have an XYZ table that

492
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:21,330
take care if you have an XYZ table that the speed of a pie with numbers all

493
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,999
the speed of a pie with numbers all right so each of this little love boxes

494
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:27,210
right so each of this little love boxes the cubes contains the probability of x

495
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,669
the cubes contains the probability of x y&amp;z having the particular values in this

496
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:32,009
y&amp;z having the particular values in this box right so if you want from this to

497
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:35,430
box right so if you want from this to get the marginal attractively you can be

498
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,310
get the marginal attractively you can be conception in the direction of Z to get

499
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:42,469
conception in the direction of Z to get the two-dimensional table right slope

500
00:27:42,469 --> 00:27:45,719
the two-dimensional table right slope this which is easily processed in two

501
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:48,180
this which is easily processed in two dimensions if it is in fifty dimensions

502
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,369
dimensions if it is in fifty dimensions really performing all these summations

503
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:54,060
really performing all these summations it's a if they're expensive task okay so

504
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:58,899
it's a if they're expensive task okay so keep that in mind

505
00:27:58,899 --> 00:27:58,909


506
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:04,940
so again for this particular probably might give you you know some of the

507
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,560
might give you you know some of the calculations I think they were contained

508
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,950
calculations I think they were contained also in the previous slide so

509
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,049
also in the previous slide so effectively what you do is you plug in

510
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:13,840
effectively what you do is you plug in the Joint Distribution of the variables

511
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,180
the Joint Distribution of the variables you plug in the values of s and W that

512
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,609
you plug in the values of s and W that your of interest and then you have to

513
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:22,159
your of interest and then you have to sum over all the possible values of

514
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,470
sum over all the possible values of these cloudy and rain

515
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,960
these cloudy and rain so this summations each of these

516
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,879
so this summations each of these variables which say takes two values all

517
00:28:28,879 --> 00:28:31,789
variables which say takes two values all along so you're going to have terms that

518
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:35,299
along so you're going to have terms that are as big as this so four terms and

519
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,519
are as big as this so four terms and then I feel you're gonna have eight

520
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:46,549
then I feel you're gonna have eight terms so generally if the body of this

521
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:49,070
terms so generally if the body of this table if the favors are obviously the

522
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,320
table if the favors are obviously the present discrete variables that's a very

523
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,060
present discrete variables that's a very easy problem all right

524
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,340
easy problem all right there is a problem solved out the years

525
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,859
there is a problem solved out the years ago so there's really no interest to do

526
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:59,359
ago so there's really no interest to do any research right then you take this

527
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:01,549
any research right then you take this because the money curves except in our

528
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:04,099
because the money curves except in our plot right now at least distributions

529
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:08,119
plot right now at least distributions are sort of forgotten I want to believe

530
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,739
are sort of forgotten I want to believe that everything has been done also

531
00:29:09,739 --> 00:29:11,119
that everything has been done also thirty forty years ago

532
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,830
thirty forty years ago okay so there's nothing no it's just to

533
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,889
okay so there's nothing no it's just to do if these conditional distributions

534
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:19,129
do if these conditional distributions are members of the exponential family I

535
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:22,879
are members of the exponential family I think the things you already have been

536
00:29:22,879 --> 00:29:24,379
think the things you already have been done and they don't look very much

537
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:25,960
done and they don't look very much different from working with gaussians

538
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,070
different from working with gaussians for those who don't know what's an

539
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,799
for those who don't know what's an exponential family of distributions you

540
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,409
exponential family of distributions you may want to look on my slice from the

541
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:38,619
may want to look on my slice from the first in the previous semester and just

542
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:41,269
first in the previous semester and just the sample a nice table but tells you

543
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:42,919
the sample a nice table but tells you which distribution speak you know

544
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:46,279
which distribution speak you know category and why things are nice when we

545
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:48,830
category and why things are nice when we work with that but right now I mean a

546
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,509
work with that but right now I mean a Detroit's our most basic unit with

547
00:29:50,509 --> 00:29:54,769
Detroit's our most basic unit with discrete values and Gaussian to convey

548
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:56,509
discrete values and Gaussian to convey the message basically on how to operate

549
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:57,270
the message basically on how to operate with this graph

550
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:02,460
with this graph so let's start with discrete animals if

551
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,680
so let's start with discrete animals if something doesn't make sense to stop me

552
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,530
something doesn't make sense to stop me because this sort of this examples were

553
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,740
because this sort of this examples were built on lots more complicated graphs as

554
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,960
built on lots more complicated graphs as we go along in the course so let's say I

555
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,390
we go along in the course so let's say I have two discrete variables X 1 and X 2

556
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:24,360
have two discrete variables X 1 and X 2 and they form a multi noni distribution

557
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,490
and they form a multi noni distribution so they can take each of them can take

558
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,000
so they can take each of them can take take different values each of these

559
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
take different values each of these values with probability mu I for the sum

560
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,550
values with probability mu I for the sum of holding is equal to R so you can

561
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,260
of holding is equal to R so you can think you know this is a generalization

562
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,230
think you know this is a generalization of a binary value me I can take values 0

563
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,470
of a binary value me I can take values 0 1 here I can take 10 values each of

564
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,720
1 here I can take 10 values each of those values with probability mu army to

565
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,810
those values with probability mu army to UK okay so there are two cases if the

566
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:56,190
UK okay so there are two cases if the most general will be to write the Joint

567
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:59,000
most general will be to write the Joint Distribution the way that you see here

568
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,600
Distribution the way that you see here okay for both not familiar notation here

569
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:10,620
okay for both not familiar notation here this axis right on 0 1 alright so we

570
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,990
this axis right on 0 1 alright so we send each of the botanist but this body

571
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:17,670
send each of the botanist but this body was to take with probabilities mu i all

572
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:17,850
was to take with probabilities mu i all right

573
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:21,030
right is the only one but you don't know which

574
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,730
is the only one but you don't know which of the K variables is active so what we

575
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:26,280
of the K variables is active so what we do here you notice is this is the joint

576
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,700
do here you notice is this is the joint distribution the probability of this

577
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,680
distribution the probability of this take the value I and still manage the

578
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,820
take the value I and still manage the exclude theta value J we call it V IJ

579
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,700
exclude theta value J we call it V IJ right so this is the joint probability

580
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,440
right so this is the joint probability that this just has the value R in this

581
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,720
that this just has the value R in this case the body J and I put in the

582
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,470
case the body J and I put in the exponent X 1 IX today and I take the

583
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,650
exponent X 1 IX today and I take the part of a forecast massage Sanjay

584
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:53,700
part of a forecast massage Sanjay because in this product only mission I

585
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,920
because in this product only mission I and one terry from X 1 and X 2 will take

586
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,330
and one terry from X 1 and X 2 will take the value 1 and everything else will be

587
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:01,170
the value 1 and everything else will be 0 right and something preserving did you

588
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,220
0 right and something preserving did you work

589
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:07,060
work you are alright because the various

590
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,710
you are alright because the various effects the star right so if we went to

591
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,299
effects the star right so if we went to a like this this is the only way we can

592
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:13,510
a like this this is the only way we can do it one of the night distance a each

593
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,570
do it one of the night distance a each vector r1 is equal to 1 this equal to

594
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,510
vector r1 is equal to 1 this equal to market x12 equal to that than equal to

595
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,480
market x12 equal to that than equal to that because we were run out of paper

596
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,630
that because we were run out of paper okay

597
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,360
okay this equation is compact it works you

598
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,190
this equation is compact it works you the joint probability distribution mu IJ

599
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,810
the joint probability distribution mu IJ and you isolate God

600
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:34,930
and you isolate God okay so this is you know it says the

601
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,030
okay so this is you know it says the number of counts that parameters in this

602
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,490
number of counts that parameters in this polish k square- walk will will be this

603
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:48,850
polish k square- walk will will be this number control

604
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:48,860


605
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:57,720
so we have K squared then the one comes from quad

606
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:57,730


607
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:06,340
so kmkj square and the one comes from

608
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:06,350


609
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:17,250
what's the password why one there's one there

610
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:17,260


611
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:24,190
nope

612
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:24,200


613
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,349
because when I some write all the possible probabilities the you know of

614
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:31,090
possible probabilities the you know of the different states the sum has to be

615
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:35,409
the different states the sum has to be equal to one is a normalization sir K

616
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:38,499
equal to one is a normalization sir K square minus one right now if I assume

617
00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:40,840
square minus one right now if I assume that the distributions of X 1 and X 2

618
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,259
that the distributions of X 1 and X 2 are independent given the parameters

619
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:49,149
are independent given the parameters mean I can write instead of repeating

620
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:50,919
mean I can write instead of repeating this with this joint probabilities mean

621
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:53,409
this with this joint probabilities mean say I can write this as the progress of

622
00:33:53,409 --> 00:33:56,619
say I can write this as the progress of UI's times the product of u j's

623
00:33:56,619 --> 00:34:05,139
UI's times the product of u j's okay and here the way it is written I am

624
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:07,509
okay and here the way it is written I am assuming that mu is the same basically

625
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:12,940
assuming that mu is the same basically about x1 x2 okay I don't see anything

626
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,970
about x1 x2 okay I don't see anything that separates the two so right they are

627
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,789
that separates the two so right they are independent and particularly way the

628
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:26,700
independent and particularly way the circle I'm going to tell you in a circle

629
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:26,710


630
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:31,000
let's count to support is not released and then we will discuss what this is

631
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,539
and then we will discuss what this is about

632
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:36,129
about what is the 210 minus r oncoming flow to

633
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:38,770
what is the 210 minus r oncoming flow to describe each of this distribution sorry

634
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,970
describe each of this distribution sorry because this is the product of two

635
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:43,869
because this is the product of two independent solutions of x1 x2 how many

636
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:46,240
independent solutions of x1 x2 how many values from a parameter need for each of

637
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,510
values from a parameter need for each of this individual product terms and it

638
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,409
this individual product terms and it came minus one right here 10 years

639
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:55,510
came minus one right here 10 years normalization of each of the P of x1 pfx

640
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,910
normalization of each of the P of x1 pfx do so k minus 1 and then I have two

641
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:01,630
do so k minus 1 and then I have two blocks so the new essentially means that

642
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,789
blocks so the new essentially means that when I have it the notation is not clear

643
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:06,190
when I have it the notation is not clear of saying that chuan has it song lyrics

644
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:12,260
of saying that chuan has it song lyrics to has its own new you see that

645
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:12,270


646
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:20,890
yes No

647
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:20,900


648
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:27,780
so basically this works the same is this equation right so x1 can take a states

649
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,630
equation right so x1 can take a states each of this case 2 I is with four

650
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,950
each of this case 2 I is with four committed in the I so let's say for

651
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,690
committed in the I so let's say for example that this was a mining anything

652
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,490
example that this was a mining anything right so near land it would be the

653
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:39,280
right so near land it would be the probability of x1 is during minute 2

654
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,920
probability of x1 is during minute 2 which is 1 minus b1 that the probability

655
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,930
which is 1 minus b1 that the probability equal to 1 but Sarah have a of those

656
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,660
equal to 1 but Sarah have a of those stage so I like all of them like that

657
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,730
stage so I like all of them like that and because I have K State's and K news

658
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:55,240
and because I have K State's and K news they we have to someone so I really have

659
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,750
they we have to someone so I really have K minus 1 K minus 1 parameters okay so I

660
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,430
K minus 1 K minus 1 parameters okay so I have K minus twelve parameter the

661
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,490
have K minus twelve parameter the implication is that this term use are

662
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:07,930
implication is that this term use are different now this is a thing right so

663
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:12,040
different now this is a thing right so you know this year I you know for

664
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,900
you know this year I you know for example for this independent

665
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,210
example for this independent distribution have it like that if you

666
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,830
distribution have it like that if you have a general distribution of LM

667
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:23,470
have a general distribution of LM variables basically the total number of

668
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:27,010
variables basically the total number of parameters is K to the N minus 1 all

669
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,110
parameters is K to the N minus 1 all right this is similar to what we had

670
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,390
right this is similar to what we had here so we have two values k square-

671
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,330
here so we have two values k square- want for them to be K to the M minus 1

672
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,060
want for them to be K to the M minus 1 so this is gross too fast for actually

673
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,290
so this is gross too fast for actually being able to do anything

674
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,260
being able to do anything now if the values are independent the

675
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,450
now if the values are independent the novel problem should be K minus 1 for

676
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,900
novel problem should be K minus 1 for its distribution times M so very small

677
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:51,840
its distribution times M so very small number and if I have a Markov chain

678
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,000
number and if I have a Markov chain alright where everything is defined in

679
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,770
alright where everything is defined in terms of this conditional distributions

680
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:59,440
terms of this conditional distributions of X i given only the previous value so

681
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,200
of X i given only the previous value so this is a first-order Markov chain it

682
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,450
this is a first-order Markov chain it says that the total number of parameters

683
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:08,170
says that the total number of parameters is K minus 1 plus n minus 1 K K minus 1

684
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:13,060
is K minus 1 plus n minus 1 K K minus 1 and and tell me what it says there what

685
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,290
and and tell me what it says there what is this novel comic problem so if I have

686
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,300
is this novel comic problem so if I have a Markov chain a first-order wide the

687
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:24,550
a Markov chain a first-order wide the total number of parameters for you know

688
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,880
total number of parameters for you know my variables is K minus 1 plus M minus 1

689
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,770
my variables is K minus 1 plus M minus 1 K minus 1 J minus 1 is from you remember

690
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,360
K minus 1 J minus 1 is from you remember to describe the Joint Distribution you

691
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,580
to describe the Joint Distribution you need to start with P of x1 and then P of

692
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,770
need to start with P of x1 and then P of X will give the next 100 P or 53 given

693
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:42,100
X will give the next 100 P or 53 given x2 etc so P reflects one has K minus

694
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,950
x2 etc so P reflects one has K minus small variables where it is and then I

695
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:48,760
small variables where it is and then I have remaining n minus 1 particles and

696
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,780
have remaining n minus 1 particles and they are defined through this

697
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,410
they are defined through this conditional distribution and how much

698
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,990
conditional distribution and how much how many body must I need for this case

699
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:00,540
how many body must I need for this case here and K any K square minus K because

700
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,390
here and K any K square minus K because this distribution for its many effects I

701
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,930
this distribution for its many effects I minus one has to sum to one and I have

702
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:11,860
minus one has to sum to one and I have three values of X I minus 1 so the K

703
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:18,460
three values of X I minus 1 so the K squared minus K okay for a Markov chain

704
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,400
squared minus K okay for a Markov chain basically you can see the cost is linear

705
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,610
basically you can see the cost is linear in M you can see here K 2 parallel

706
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,860
in M you can see here K 2 parallel alright that's not very good

707
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,970
alright that's not very good so this is sort of the most trivial case

708
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,650
so this is sort of the most trivial case and and the graph basically for that

709
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:39,640
and and the graph basically for that looks like now I know some of you have I

710
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,260
looks like now I know some of you have I mean I'm assuming of taking other

711
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,810
mean I'm assuming of taking other statistics process some took the course

712
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,930
statistics process some took the course the semester and some have not

713
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:52,330
the semester and some have not so you know I know you got some homework

714
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,540
so you know I know you got some homework problems where the assumption was that

715
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,670
problems where the assumption was that you look at the graph and you know

716
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,980
you look at the graph and you know everything from the skies what it means

717
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:04,030
everything from the skies what it means with I suggest this if when you come

718
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,890
with I suggest this if when you come across these things and you don't know

719
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,710
across these things and you don't know or you want to see more references send

720
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:11,020
or you want to see more references send me an email I will send you very few

721
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,870
me an email I will send you very few pages of reading to see these things in

722
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,850
pages of reading to see these things in in detail just in case you haven't seen

723
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,630
in detail just in case you haven't seen them before

724
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,750
them before so this is

725
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,120
so this is the cases with discreet Barnabas and I

726
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,500
the cases with discreet Barnabas and I give you a few examples so let's look at

727
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:29,690
give you a few examples so let's look at the example of the top okay it says we

728
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,160
the example of the top okay it says we take everything to be discrete right now

729
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,640
take everything to be discrete right now okay so I have a Markov chain

730
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,500
okay so I have a Markov chain okay next one next to the exam but x1

731
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,260
okay next one next to the exam but x1 depends on I mean you can sit here some

732
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,840
depends on I mean you can sit here some parameters mean you are excused from you

733
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:51,230
parameters mean you are excused from you to examine some um and mainly depends

734
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:58,460
to examine some um and mainly depends means the general the composition or

735
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,320
means the general the composition or factorization of the distribution of

736
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,390
factorization of the distribution of we're looking at this graph the

737
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:16,160
we're looking at this graph the distribution is given you on its power

738
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,200
distribution is given you on its power alright the distributions of x2 given x1

739
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,550
alright the distributions of x2 given x1 and given you two extremes even

740
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,190
and given you two extremes even explained given in you three acceptance

741
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,810
explained given in you three acceptance of this product okay

742
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,230
of this product okay potential the product of P of me to feel

743
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:37,190
potential the product of P of me to feel from you three P of MU M so this is the

744
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:40,520
from you three P of MU M so this is the factorization over the gap okay so um

745
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,920
factorization over the gap okay so um are basically the parameters that are

746
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,490
are basically the parameters that are needed to define this dynamical model or

747
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:49,310
needed to define this dynamical model or the terms you have to go from X minus n

748
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:55,880
the terms you have to go from X minus n minus 1 to xn okay and in this case you

749
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,250
minus 1 to xn okay and in this case you know there's no levels because they are

750
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,960
know there's no levels because they are discrete and take K values

751
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,810
discrete and take K values this can take K values and I will need

752
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,910
this can take K values and I will need to put some priority good poverty put is

753
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:08,570
to put some priority good poverty put is a dealer distribution the red

754
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,270
a dealer distribution the red distributions are going to count very

755
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:14,270
distributions are going to count very often later in the question I only want

756
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:18,050
often later in the question I only want you to look on Wikipedia and get some

757
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:20,460
you to look on Wikipedia and get some sense of what

758
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,430
sense of what it's a conjugate prior basically to the

759
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,960
it's a conjugate prior basically to the Volta and Moody distribution so it's

760
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,140
Volta and Moody distribution so it's very important to to play and it's

761
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:33,359
very important to to play and it's social a very sort of interesting topic

762
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,200
social a very sort of interesting topic for research because here some I very

763
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,730
for research because here some I very recent ideas a colleague from dear

764
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,480
recent ideas a colleague from dear Claire processes not distributions okay

765
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,150
Claire processes not distributions okay and statistical computer science because

766
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:50,670
and statistical computer science because this is a very important topic does this

767
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,530
this is a very important topic does this looking at this graph does it make any

768
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:59,309
looking at this graph does it make any sense right the optimization this is all

769
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:02,040
sense right the optimization this is all my own on battabox my exes and my new is

770
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,960
my own on battabox my exes and my new is nothing I don't give anything right so

771
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,790
nothing I don't give anything right so the Joint Distribution I write it like

772
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,240
the Joint Distribution I write it like that

773
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,550
that is this equation like the first and

774
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:17,800
is this equation like the first and second line do we make tent no general

775
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:17,810


776
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:28,150
right so you you know you have to put these conditionals giving the parents

777
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,460
these conditionals giving the parents but then sometimes when her parents

778
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,500
but then sometimes when her parents meanwhile has no parent so he will come

779
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,380
meanwhile has no parent so he will come home Nia took has no plans we come alone

780
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,330
home Nia took has no plans we come alone um he's no father he come alone all

781
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,640
um he's no father he come alone all right and because we would be interested

782
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,430
right and because we would be interested to eventually sort of the Bayesian

783
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:45,370
to eventually sort of the Bayesian analysis on the parameters in the model

784
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,400
analysis on the parameters in the model is good to put the prior all right a lot

785
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,250
is good to put the prior all right a lot prior theories to declare prior that is

786
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,250
prior theories to declare prior that is going to have its own type of parameters

787
00:42:53,250 --> 00:43:01,359
going to have its own type of parameters alpha alpha mutant yep

788
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:01,369


789
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:10,959
from n equal to 2 thank you yep okay so the product to be m equal to 2 I wish I

790
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:14,289
the product to be m equal to 2 I wish I can just say to my computer please

791
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:18,279
can just say to my computer please change doesn't I don't know why the

792
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:21,819
change doesn't I don't know why the technology is not as sophisticated so

793
00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:23,380
technology is not as sophisticated so please remind me if I forget to change

794
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,380
please remind me if I forget to change this and the same I supposed to have to

795
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,799
this and the same I supposed to have to it right okay so this is the very

796
00:43:29,799 --> 00:43:35,319
it right okay so this is the very general setting and I am taking the same

797
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:37,779
general setting and I am taking the same problem and I'm actually simplifying it

798
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:40,779
problem and I'm actually simplifying it enormously with a second Republic the

799
00:43:40,779 --> 00:43:42,370
enormously with a second Republic the graphical model so what's the

800
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,809
graphical model so what's the simplification that you see on the

801
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:52,150
simplification that you see on the second graph that is enormous so what is

802
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:55,089
second graph that is enormous so what is the simplification you can stick on the

803
00:43:55,089 --> 00:44:01,089
the simplification you can stick on the top so the parameters start I made some

804
00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:04,450
top so the parameters start I made some using the same parameters to define all

805
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:05,370
using the same parameters to define all this conditional probability

806
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:08,019
this conditional probability distributions okay I mean that's of

807
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:10,269
distributions okay I mean that's of course a major assumption but you can

808
00:44:10,269 --> 00:44:12,910
course a major assumption but you can appreciate the inference with one meal

809
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,430
appreciate the inference with one meal versus doing influence with thousands of

810
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:15,700
versus doing influence with thousands of gnu's

811
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,870
gnu's okay all right so time of the parameters

812
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:28,719
okay all right so time of the parameters makes things extremely late so I think

813
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:31,089
makes things extremely late so I think maybe in the processing we maybe

814
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:33,819
maybe in the processing we maybe advocated this problem and we said is

815
00:44:33,819 --> 00:44:36,130
advocated this problem and we said is not going to be here so often in this

816
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:37,870
not going to be here so often in this course but let me use this as a sort of

817
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:40,599
course but let me use this as a sort of a counter example so let's say we have M

818
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:42,249
a counter example so let's say we have M variables again that they are discrete

819
00:44:42,249 --> 00:44:45,609
variables again that they are discrete and each of them can take K different

820
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:48,219
and each of them can take K different states and I'm interested in some sort

821
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:50,739
states and I'm interested in some sort of a classification problem strike one

822
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:56,589
of a classification problem strike one for example to know if X 1 to X what's

823
00:44:56,589 --> 00:44:59,950
for example to know if X 1 to X what's the probability of y equal to 1 right

824
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,979
the probability of y equal to 1 right given X 1 and X n so maybe why can't one

825
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:05,000
given X 1 and X n so maybe why can't one is 1000 from

826
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
is 1000 from later come y equal to zero some other

827
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,400
later come y equal to zero some other Gaussian okay but I'm interested to just

828
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,310
Gaussian okay but I'm interested to just compute only to do classification in

829
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,300
compute only to do classification in this probability

830
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,840
this probability okay so somebody can build this

831
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,730
okay so somebody can build this complicated graphs that we had before

832
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:22,640
complicated graphs that we had before and form the joint probability of Y and

833
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,120
and form the joint probability of Y and all the XS alright and do interested of

834
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,080
all the XS alright and do interested of graph but an approach that is actually

835
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,940
graph but an approach that is actually the best if the only thing you carry is

836
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,430
the best if the only thing you carry is this conditional probability is actually

837
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,230
this conditional probability is actually to try to flip it in some non-linearity

838
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,690
to try to flip it in some non-linearity and what non-linearity here is the

839
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:41,210
and what non-linearity here is the sigmoid function so basically what you

840
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,730
sigmoid function so basically what you say is you know what I'm going to model

841
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:46,310
say is you know what I'm going to model this as a sigmoid function where I'm

842
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:49,000
this as a sigmoid function where I'm gonna use some linear approach linear

843
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,160
gonna use some linear approach linear interpolation of the artists okay with

844
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:59,080
interpolation of the artists okay with some unknown parameters W so you know

845
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,980
some unknown parameters W so you know conditional distributions or anything

846
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,560
conditional distributions or anything like that and then of analysis or the

847
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,920
like that and then of analysis or the W's and I only have M plus small W all

848
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,530
W's and I only have M plus small W all right so this says things you can write

849
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,840
right so this says things you can write in the quantities of classification

850
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,530
in the quantities of classification these are the best ways to actually to

851
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:21,650
these are the best ways to actually to model this using a parameter is

852
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,380
model this using a parameter is basically model for this conditional

853
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,080
basically model for this conditional distribution around about claiming the

854
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,870
distribution around about claiming the whole Joint Distribution working sort of

855
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:33,880
whole Joint Distribution working sort of in in in of the narrative sense okay but

856
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,320
in in in of the narrative sense okay but this gives you only this probability you

857
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,630
this gives you only this probability you cannot do much except just using that

858
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,120
cannot do much except just using that probability that's good you stop there

859
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,340
probability that's good you stop there if it's not good then it has to look at

860
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:47,120
if it's not good then it has to look at a more general way

861
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:47,130


862
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:52,479
all right tell me the example that you guys should be given in the homework

863
00:46:52,479 --> 00:47:00,049
guys should be given in the homework okay anybody has go to this problem so

864
00:47:00,049 --> 00:47:01,579
okay anybody has go to this problem so let me work it for you because I haven't

865
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:06,109
let me work it for you because I haven't read the solution so I don't know what

866
00:47:06,109 --> 00:47:10,400
read the solution so I don't know what it is asking maybe he's asking you to do

867
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,219
it is asking maybe he's asking you to do what's on the slide and flop is the case

868
00:47:12,219 --> 00:47:15,079
what's on the slide and flop is the case you better correct my slide because I'm

869
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:16,309
you better correct my slide because I'm sure something must be wrong

870
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:19,460
sure something must be wrong all right not just typed wrong but you

871
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:28,039
all right not just typed wrong but you know so you guys find a mistake software

872
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:31,999
know so you guys find a mistake software linearization model you can think again

873
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:39,380
linearization model you can think again of you know where this conditional

874
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,719
of you know where this conditional distributions of X i given its parents

875
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:45,469
distributions of X i given its parents we're going to model it as a linear

876
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:48,650
we're going to model it as a linear thousand model what does that mean means

877
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:51,799
thousand model what does that mean means we're going to take the mean of this

878
00:47:51,799 --> 00:47:57,549
we're going to take the mean of this condition the tribution to be a weighted

879
00:47:57,549 --> 00:48:01,819
condition the tribution to be a weighted average of their parents this is what

880
00:48:01,819 --> 00:48:05,239
average of their parents this is what this is plus some bias term and then

881
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:09,170
this is plus some bias term and then plus some noise this is very generic

882
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,390
plus some noise this is very generic actually this is what we call the linear

883
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:16,309
actually this is what we call the linear Gaussian model alright so in this case

884
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:17,900
Gaussian model alright so in this case what is very particular for this linear

885
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,299
what is very particular for this linear Gaussian model is that the axis that you

886
00:48:20,299 --> 00:48:23,660
Gaussian model is that the axis that you use to define the mean defined from the

887
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,789
use to define the mean defined from the products right this one of the finest

888
00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:28,279
products right this one of the finest this X J's are the parents of no diary

889
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:31,789
this X J's are the parents of no diary but this mean is linear in X J and then

890
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:36,019
but this mean is linear in X J and then I plug in some noise V so the announced

891
00:48:36,019 --> 00:48:37,609
I plug in some noise V so the announced basically in the problem our world is

892
00:48:37,609 --> 00:48:41,450
basically in the problem our world is double used all right the bias terms

893
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:47,359
double used all right the bias terms based and the variance is V okay so if

894
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,829
based and the variance is V okay so if you want to share this being a model

895
00:48:48,829 --> 00:48:53,329
you want to share this being a model written sort of in an algebraic form you

896
00:48:53,329 --> 00:48:55,489
written sort of in an algebraic form you can say the VEX hi

897
00:48:55,489 --> 00:48:58,489
can say the VEX hi the main value plus square root of VI

898
00:48:58,489 --> 00:49:01,640
the main value plus square root of VI times from normal Gaussian but they

899
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:08,509
times from normal Gaussian but they actually okay with this elementary

900
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:10,759
actually okay with this elementary properties so you can see this this way

901
00:49:10,759 --> 00:49:14,569
properties so you can see this this way or you can see it this way it is the

902
00:49:14,569 --> 00:49:15,829
or you can see it this way it is the same thing okay

903
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:19,700
same thing okay so linear motion because you know this

904
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,370
so linear motion because you know this the in the mean is a linear function of

905
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:27,019
the in the mean is a linear function of the exist the linearity comes everywhere

906
00:49:27,019 --> 00:49:29,329
the exist the linearity comes everywhere it's Gaussian because not only this

907
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:31,339
it's Gaussian because not only this condition distribution of X i given the

908
00:49:31,339 --> 00:49:33,529
condition distribution of X i given the parent is down shell for that so you can

909
00:49:33,529 --> 00:49:36,079
parent is down shell for that so you can so if you take all of these gardens you

910
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,150
so if you take all of these gardens you multiply them with each other if you

911
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:40,279
multiply them with each other if you expand and then you close the square as

912
00:49:40,279 --> 00:49:42,470
expand and then you close the square as they say you can solve that the joint

913
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:45,710
they say you can solve that the joint distribution is also Gaussian right it's

914
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,609
distribution is also Gaussian right it's a quadratic I mean and I again I am NOT

915
00:49:48,609 --> 00:49:50,989
a quadratic I mean and I again I am NOT doing the algebra because it's not water

916
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:54,079
doing the algebra because it's not water but if you take the logs right and you

917
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,900
but if you take the logs right and you come up the product of all these

918
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,640
come up the product of all these distributions becomes summation of the

919
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,799
distributions becomes summation of the logs and then you get this squares and

920
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:03,289
logs and then you get this squares and if you expand them you can basically get

921
00:50:03,289 --> 00:50:05,690
if you expand them you can basically get a square for to fit that they're

922
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:09,259
a square for to fit that they're multivariate gaussian so this leads to

923
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:14,809
multivariate gaussian so this leads to the multivariate Gaussian so the problem

924
00:50:14,809 --> 00:50:17,150
the multivariate Gaussian so the problem here is we want for this graph but is

925
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,460
here is we want for this graph but is represented by this conditional

926
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,210
represented by this conditional distributions we want to compute the

927
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:25,370
distributions we want to compute the mean of all the nodes and we want to

928
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:33,549
mean of all the nodes and we want to compute the the covariance right and

929
00:50:33,549 --> 00:50:33,559


930
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:38,599
this are the equations where he wants you to prove them for me they are my

931
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:41,089
you to prove them for me they are my sites but once you take some time to

932
00:50:41,089 --> 00:50:43,220
sites but once you take some time to prove this equations because they are

933
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,559
prove this equations because they are not obvious okay nothing is obvious in

934
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:55,239
not obvious okay nothing is obvious in life and so if you take the mean let's

935
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:59,329
life and so if you take the mean let's here this is the main of the condition

936
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:01,309
here this is the main of the condition of the tradition of next events parlance

937
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:03,360
of the tradition of next events parlance okay

938
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,650
okay [Applause]

939
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:11,380
[Applause] take the main effect I is actually let

940
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,120
take the main effect I is actually let me give this equation the meaning of X I

941
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:17,980
me give this equation the meaning of X I is summation over the parents of Waj the

942
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,099
is summation over the parents of Waj the mean effect A plus bi and the mean of

943
00:51:21,099 --> 00:51:27,940
mean effect A plus bi and the mean of this which is zero all right

944
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:27,950


945
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:35,680
using this little equation the this means if you put them together alright

946
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,109
means if you put them together alright if you calculate them recursively and

947
00:51:38,109 --> 00:51:40,359
if you calculate them recursively and you put them in order you know it will

948
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:42,310
you put them in order you know it will give you the mean of the multivariate

949
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:45,970
give you the mean of the multivariate body will exit everybody says this the

950
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:49,120
body will exit everybody says this the question I'm just using this and I take

951
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,849
question I'm just using this and I take the mean of X I the summation there will

952
00:51:51,849 --> 00:51:55,180
the mean of X I the summation there will be the mean of its J this is constant

953
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:58,240
be the mean of its J this is constant the mean of this is zero alright so

954
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,950
the mean of this is zero alright so basically they have very testy relation

955
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,740
basically they have very testy relation and those means of what I put them

956
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,300
and those means of what I put them together in a vector form will give me

957
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,040
together in a vector form will give me the mean of vector X

958
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:15,820
the mean of vector X okay now bit more complicated the name

959
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,670
okay now bit more complicated the name of the covariance is giving sort of a

960
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:23,140
of the covariance is giving sort of a similar expression this coefficient WJ k

961
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,070
similar expression this coefficient WJ k for k of the parent i have to use a cake

962
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,690
for k of the parent i have to use a cake here because there's an ion is a there

963
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:31,870
here because there's an ion is a there right so WJ k the covariance of excite

964
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:36,490
right so WJ k the covariance of excite with the XK minus of X I XJ so notice

965
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:39,190
with the XK minus of X I XJ so notice here there's a j from the urban decay

966
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,740
here there's a j from the urban decay that are the parlance of j and then

967
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,070
that are the parlance of j and then there is an extra pair that is another

968
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:47,440
there is an extra pair that is another function alright so a equal to RF i and

969
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,700
function alright so a equal to RF i and j is equal otherwise 0 square root of

970
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,849
j is equal otherwise 0 square root of the IV j mr. variance is right so i need

971
00:52:54,849 --> 00:52:58,780
the IV j mr. variance is right so i need to have VI VJ and when i like the

972
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,270
to have VI VJ and when i like the situation I forgot to maybe to put this

973
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:03,280
situation I forgot to maybe to put this from the previous slide this is for I

974
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,250
from the previous slide this is for I less or equal to J so you may want to

975
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,169
less or equal to J so you may want to take and

976
00:53:07,169 --> 00:53:11,640
take and so this in the weight of a habit is for

977
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,089
so this in the weight of a habit is for I less or equal to jelly okay if you

978
00:53:15,089 --> 00:53:17,309
I less or equal to jelly okay if you know this right you can need something

979
00:53:17,309 --> 00:53:19,679
know this right you can need something else you can use symmetry and you can

980
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:22,799
else you can use symmetry and you can get for I greater than say a similar

981
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:24,390
get for I greater than say a similar expression but this is choir less or

982
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:30,739
expression but this is choir less or equal to Z how do you prove this

983
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:36,509
equal to Z how do you prove this equation alright doesn't ask you this or

984
00:53:36,509 --> 00:53:40,919
equation alright doesn't ask you this or I don't know if he does anything they

985
00:53:40,919 --> 00:53:46,499
I don't know if he does anything they say prove it okay all right so if you

986
00:53:46,499 --> 00:53:49,529
say prove it okay all right so if you want to prove it so if you want the

987
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:52,319
want to prove it so if you want the covariance of X I XJ by definition is

988
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:52,829
covariance of X I XJ by definition is this

989
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:55,380
this it's like if XY minus the mean of X

990
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,549
it's like if XY minus the mean of X sorry XJ minus the mean of XJ I'm using

991
00:53:59,549 --> 00:54:03,749
sorry XJ minus the mean of XJ I'm using this you can leave this relation this

992
00:54:03,749 --> 00:54:06,569
this you can leave this relation this linear starting point that I had the urn

993
00:54:06,569 --> 00:54:10,140
linear starting point that I had the urn and I'm subtracting the means of X I and

994
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:14,159
and I'm subtracting the means of X I and XJ and basically I stopped invest and he

995
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:17,579
XJ and basically I stopped invest and he will take this fall will case amount of

996
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:24,359
will take this fall will case amount of jail ok so now I'm going to have a

997
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:28,229
jail ok so now I'm going to have a summation of the points of j WJ k and

998
00:54:28,229 --> 00:54:30,870
summation of the points of j WJ k and then i'm going to have the expectation

999
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,789
then i'm going to have the expectation of this parentheses final thought is the

1000
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:36,630
of this parentheses final thought is the covariance of X I X K so the first times

1001
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:40,529
covariance of X I X K so the first times that is it there and then there is the

1002
00:54:40,529 --> 00:54:42,620
that is it there and then there is the expectation of this parentheses times

1003
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,409
expectation of this parentheses times this term that involves if she'll say

1004
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:51,149
this term that involves if she'll say all right and if the previous equation

1005
00:54:51,149 --> 00:54:53,969
all right and if the previous equation square but progress of expectation needs

1006
00:54:53,969 --> 00:54:58,890
square but progress of expectation needs to come to be equal to rest and the only

1007
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:00,659
to come to be equal to rest and the only way that I have been able to actually

1008
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:03,749
way that I have been able to actually prove this is sort of doing it

1009
00:55:03,749 --> 00:55:06,870
prove this is sort of doing it recursively okay so if you guys come up

1010
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:10,289
recursively okay so if you guys come up with a cleaner way not only you send me

1011
00:55:10,289 --> 00:55:11,849
with a cleaner way not only you send me the right proof but you send me the

1012
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:12,359
the right proof but you send me the correct

1013
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:14,640
correct question to cut and paste on my style

1014
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,910
question to cut and paste on my style it's today because I saw to play not

1015
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:19,440
it's today because I saw to play not particularly happy with provost

1016
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,069
particularly happy with provost derivation but so again we want to pull

1017
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,349
derivation but so again we want to pull the expectation of this x naught is

1018
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:27,839
the expectation of this x naught is equal to that and the way that I do it

1019
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:32,359
equal to that and the way that I do it is I write rest from our original

1020
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:35,549
is I write rest from our original equation right I stops you this in terms

1021
00:55:35,549 --> 00:55:38,160
equation right I stops you this in terms of its power and values right this is

1022
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,249
of its power and values right this is the expectation okay and then whether

1023
00:55:41,249 --> 00:55:45,150
the expectation okay and then whether whether I started doing is remember I

1024
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,470
whether I started doing is remember I have a no-life here

1025
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:49,259
have a no-life here the files have default node I and the

1026
00:55:49,259 --> 00:55:52,620
the files have default node I and the parents of higher default that so what I

1027
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:55,079
parents of higher default that so what I this I recursively introduce the

1028
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:57,630
this I recursively introduce the parlance of Pi and then for its power in

1029
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:00,749
parlance of Pi and then for its power in the PI M I introduce its own term and I

1030
00:56:00,749 --> 00:56:05,910
the PI M I introduce its own term and I keep doing this until it's norm so when

1031
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:09,569
keep doing this until it's norm so when you do it sort of this way okay it comes

1032
00:56:09,569 --> 00:56:11,759
you do it sort of this way okay it comes up but when you take it

1033
00:56:11,759 --> 00:56:15,329
up but when you take it most times that and expectations the

1034
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:16,950
most times that and expectations the contributions you will get from this

1035
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:21,450
contributions you will get from this summation left to you know to zero and

1036
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:24,029
summation left to you know to zero and then you're going to care basically this

1037
00:56:24,029 --> 00:56:28,170
then you're going to care basically this BJP I epsilon R epsilon J expectation

1038
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:30,589
BJP I epsilon R epsilon J expectation which effectively at the end of the day

1039
00:56:30,589 --> 00:56:32,720
which effectively at the end of the day will give you this

1040
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,130
will give you this I'm highlighting the proof is part of

1041
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:38,430
I'm highlighting the proof is part of your homework if you want to look at it

1042
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:42,120
your homework if you want to look at it okay it sounds about right

1043
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:46,890
okay it sounds about right but this is going to compute

1044
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:48,539
but this is going to compute expectations this is how you complete

1045
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:50,849
expectations this is how you complete the covariance both equations are

1046
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:52,799
the covariance both equations are requested because to compute the

1047
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,109
requested because to compute the covariance of X IJ with high in less or

1048
00:56:55,109 --> 00:56:57,269
covariance of X IJ with high in less or equal to J you need the prevalence of

1049
00:56:57,269 --> 00:57:00,809
equal to J you need the prevalence of excited with a parent of J and to

1050
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:03,239
excited with a parent of J and to compute this you need the parents of K

1051
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:09,230
compute this you need the parents of K and etc etc from here it's the the

1052
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:13,670
and etc etc from here it's the the let me give you an example if you have

1053
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:19,030
let me give you an example if you have three minutes

1054
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:19,040


1055
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:28,569
the first impression the expectation can you tell me for first equation control

1056
00:57:28,569 --> 00:57:28,579


1057
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:34,700
alright I remind you I remind you this nice equation the expectation of any

1058
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,069
nice equation the expectation of any node is w IJ times the expectation of

1059
00:57:37,069 --> 00:57:43,220
node is w IJ times the expectation of the pilots of 12 J okay I'll tell the

1060
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:55,809
the pilots of 12 J okay I'll tell the parents pi times D I so okay not great I

1061
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:55,819


1062
00:57:55,819 --> 00:58:00,890
want them to be with zinnias memory to remember this equation right not three

1063
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:07,210
remember this equation right not three what are the odds of not playing just

1064
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:07,220


1065
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:23,569
the expectation of x two times the expectation of Nordics few and what is

1066
00:58:23,569 --> 00:58:27,980
expectation of Nordics few and what is the expectation of no to the expectation

1067
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:36,380
the expectation of no to the expectation of note a will be 1 times the

1068
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,480
of note a will be 1 times the expectation of X 1 and what is the

1069
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,690
expectation of X 1 and what is the expectation of X 1 is B 1 because there

1070
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:42,650
expectation of X 1 is B 1 because there are no power

1071
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,780
are no power all right so when you put all of this

1072
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,579
all right so when you put all of this together you get this nice integration

1073
00:58:46,579 --> 00:58:51,200
together you get this nice integration of this and this and similarly good

1074
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,700
of this and this and similarly good check for example let's say the

1075
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,349
check for example let's say the covariance of X 1 and X 3 I have the

1076
00:58:54,349 --> 00:58:56,420
covariance of X 1 and X 3 I have the formula clear so we don't have to go

1077
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:00,380
formula clear so we don't have to go back and forth this is the formula that

1078
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:05,180
back and forth this is the formula that says they are the parents of of 3 the

1079
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,670
says they are the parents of of 3 the parts of 3 still straight will be done 3

1080
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:10,329
parts of 3 still straight will be done 3 2 times the covariance of X 1 and X 2

1081
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:13,789
2 times the covariance of X 1 and X 2 the covariance of X 1 and X 2 unique the

1082
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:16,549
the covariance of X 1 and X 2 unique the potential 2 which is 1 so it will be W 2

1083
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:19,700
potential 2 which is 1 so it will be W 2 1 times the covariance of X 1 X 1 plus

1084
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:23,430
1 times the covariance of X 1 X 1 plus these delta function 1 2 times B 2 this

1085
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:27,450
these delta function 1 2 times B 2 this function is 0 so you get W 3 2 W 2 1 and

1086
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:34,319
function is 0 so you get W 3 2 W 2 1 and the covariance of X 1 X 1 is V 1 ok so

1087
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:40,140
the covariance of X 1 X 1 is V 1 ok so it's a complicated painful calculation

1088
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,839
it's a complicated painful calculation we have on the other hand it's a closed

1089
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:47,539
we have on the other hand it's a closed form solution you have the mean just by

1090
00:59:47,539 --> 00:59:51,480
form solution you have the mean just by playing together with this conditional

1091
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,279
playing together with this conditional probability distributions you can

1092
00:59:53,279 --> 00:59:55,140
probability distributions you can compute the mean of the Joint

1093
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,480
compute the mean of the Joint Distribution and the covariance and and

1094
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:04,010
Distribution and the covariance and and and you know you have everything alright

1095
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:04,020


1096
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:14,010
how many parameters from this model so again the parameters in the model are

1097
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,190
again the parameters in the model are these variances and there are diverse

1098
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:20,910
these variances and there are diverse because you know I suppose my god just

1099
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:23,730
because you know I suppose my god just denote in this case alright so I have

1100
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:26,700
denote in this case alright so I have the variant it and then it says the

1101
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,049
the variant it and then it says the parameters W IJ Rd square minus V over 2

1102
01:00:30,049 --> 01:00:35,430
parameters W IJ Rd square minus V over 2 what do I get out if you remember this

1103
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:38,359
what do I get out if you remember this problem is defined the you know your

1104
01:00:38,359 --> 01:00:42,269
problem is defined the you know your dependence on the parents right so if

1105
01:00:42,269 --> 01:00:45,150
dependence on the parents right so if I'm interested to try on w12 how much is

1106
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:51,029
I'm interested to try on w12 how much is w12 there's not that we want to 0 right

1107
01:00:51,029 --> 01:00:54,660
w12 there's not that we want to 0 right I mean the only thing I have here is

1108
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,589
I mean the only thing I have here is let's if I look at no.3 I have W 3 2 and

1109
01:00:58,589 --> 01:01:02,640
let's if I look at no.3 I have W 3 2 and W you know W 3 2 is nonzero because the

1110
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,910
W you know W 3 2 is nonzero because the parent of 2 is the parent of three all

1111
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:09,930
parent of 2 is the parent of three all right so I am looking is this not B to

1112
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:13,019
right so I am looking is this not B to be a lower triangular matrix and a lower

1113
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:15,240
be a lower triangular matrix and a lower triangular matrix change the dimensions

1114
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,690
triangular matrix change the dimensions is what totally the square minus B in

1115
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:20,940
is what totally the square minus B in the Bellarmine I'll then take half you

1116
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:24,740
the Bellarmine I'll then take half you get this square minus B over 2

1117
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:24,750


1118
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:31,190
it comes that this complicated linear Gaussian model if you solve this 2 is 3

1119
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:34,100
Gaussian model if you solve this 2 is 3 times 3 plus 1 over 2 which is actually

1120
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:39,650
times 3 plus 1 over 2 which is actually the same as the covariance matrix of you

1121
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:42,830
the same as the covariance matrix of you know the division alright symmetric

1122
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:51,290
know the division alright symmetric various metrics so that effectively the

1123
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:54,350
various metrics so that effectively the Joint Distribution is a Gaussian alright

1124
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:56,900
Joint Distribution is a Gaussian alright so obviously this probably needs to be

1125
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:03,770
so obviously this probably needs to be sort of equivalent to to you know to

1126
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:07,400
sort of equivalent to to you know to this order of parameters required for a

1127
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,410
this order of parameters required for a multivariate Gaussian basically to

1128
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:20,030
multivariate Gaussian basically to define the covariance matrix okay simple

1129
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:24,110
define the covariance matrix okay simple 12 approach to this problem that is from

1130
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:28,490
12 approach to this problem that is from Malthus book and it is Center for a very

1131
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:30,890
Malthus book and it is Center for a very simple calculation without any recursive

1132
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:33,650
simple calculation without any recursive relationships okay so you may appreciate

1133
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,630
relationships okay so you may appreciate this derivation because only one slide

1134
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:41,230
this derivation because only one slide or two

1135
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:41,240


1136
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:47,890
so I kept the notation from a meta so don't mixed up that's how many equations

1137
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:50,080
don't mixed up that's how many equations but this kilonewtons acting on the same

1138
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,660
but this kilonewtons acting on the same problem alright so in several V this

1139
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:55,090
problem alright so in several V this conditional variance here he is using

1140
01:02:55,090 --> 01:02:59,620
conditional variance here he is using Sigma T Square this is my bias term was

1141
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:03,750
Sigma T Square this is my bias term was because ultimately the same problem okay

1142
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:21,190
because ultimately the same problem okay so what she does is the coloring have

1143
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:24,400
so what she does is the coloring have bunnies I subtracted the mean from the

1144
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,800
bunnies I subtracted the mean from the values of each node

1145
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:35,800
values of each node okay so okay so from this node and the

1146
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,780
okay so okay so from this node and the parents basically would have done is not

1147
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,690
parents basically would have done is not subtracting the mean okay and so this is

1148
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:42,190
subtracting the mean okay and so this is the similar equation with what I had

1149
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:44,350
the similar equation with what I had before this is like my noise level

1150
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:47,320
before this is like my noise level emtional I had before but by writing the

1151
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,740
emtional I had before but by writing the equation like not where the mean of the

1152
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:53,950
equation like not where the mean of the normal values come explicitly I can

1153
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:55,480
normal values come explicitly I can write this whole equation as a vector

1154
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,470
write this whole equation as a vector form as follows X minus mu is a vector

1155
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:05,260
form as follows X minus mu is a vector equal lower diagonal matrix W similar to

1156
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,920
equal lower diagonal matrix W similar to what we had before times X minus Mew

1157
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,220
what we had before times X minus Mew okay and I can write this as the matrix

1158
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:15,760
okay and I can write this as the matrix s in this case will be the banner that

1159
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,090
s in this case will be the banner that contains the noise viruses okay I

1160
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:24,220
contains the noise viruses okay I suppose yes this before we had the

1161
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:25,870
suppose yes this before we had the square root of the variance so this is

1162
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:28,450
square root of the variance so this is you know it's the standard deviation so

1163
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:31,000
you know it's the standard deviation so this correct stress is the diagonal of

1164
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,470
this correct stress is the diagonal of Sigma times the vector Z this is the

1165
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:37,540
Sigma times the vector Z this is the same equation I had discovered the only

1166
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,550
same equation I had discovered the only difference is now alright that I can

1167
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:43,359
difference is now alright that I can write this as a matrix equation where

1168
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:45,429
write this as a matrix equation where what is different from the expression we

1169
01:04:45,429 --> 01:04:48,429
what is different from the expression we used before is that instead of Texas

1170
01:04:48,429 --> 01:04:52,149
used before is that instead of Texas with X minus left the means of the

1171
01:04:52,149 --> 01:04:55,779
with X minus left the means of the northern body and there's a reason to do

1172
01:04:55,779 --> 01:05:00,699
northern body and there's a reason to do this because so this is an equation if

1173
01:05:00,699 --> 01:05:03,189
this because so this is an equation if you trying just to start with it will be

1174
01:05:03,189 --> 01:05:06,819
you trying just to start with it will be s times if RS is this diagonal of the

1175
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,529
s times if RS is this diagonal of the standard deviations in the conditional

1176
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:13,839
standard deviations in the conditional distribution so this is e x minus mu you

1177
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:16,479
distribution so this is e x minus mu you can see from here times 9 minus 9 is

1178
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,640
can see from here times 9 minus 9 is going to come to be e all right so

1179
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:23,169
going to come to be e all right so finally this explicitly e equal I - down

1180
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,029
finally this explicitly e equal I - down the year

1181
01:05:24,029 --> 01:05:26,919
the year alright a nice invertible matrix times X

1182
01:05:26,919 --> 01:05:31,839
alright a nice invertible matrix times X minus mu all right and I can solve for X

1183
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:35,019
minus mu all right and I can solve for X minus mu by inverting this matrix I

1184
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:44,319
minus mu by inverting this matrix I minus W times P all right and ok is f

1185
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,359
minus W times P all right and ok is f prime Z when I try let me call this

1186
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:50,429
prime Z when I try let me call this matrix you alright well this matrix is U

1187
01:05:50,429 --> 01:06:10,299
matrix you alright well this matrix is U times s times Z all right when we need

1188
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,279
times s times Z all right when we need the complicated calculation the

1189
01:06:12,279 --> 01:06:13,929
the complicated calculation the constraints approach the same as the

1190
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:17,380
constraints approach the same as the covariance of X minus mu X minus mu from

1191
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:20,999
covariance of X minus mu X minus mu from this equation is again this is me way

1192
01:06:20,999 --> 01:06:23,620
this equation is again this is me way the investor fineliners now the use of

1193
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:26,979
the investor fineliners now the use of the waist right so the terms of real

1194
01:06:26,979 --> 01:06:29,679
the waist right so the terms of real times test as you remember is the

1195
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:32,169
times test as you remember is the diagonal of the conditional standard

1196
01:06:32,169 --> 01:06:36,039
diagonal of the conditional standard deviation s times G is minus vector and

1197
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:39,699
deviation s times G is minus vector and the covariance of U times s times D from

1198
01:06:39,699 --> 01:06:42,459
the covariance of U times s times D from classical identity from your probability

1199
01:06:42,459 --> 01:06:45,339
classical identity from your probability cost is us times the covariance of J

1200
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:48,940
cost is us times the covariance of J times the transpose of this as you

1201
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:52,510
times the transpose of this as you Forest Service identity so you get us

1202
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:55,270
Forest Service identity so you get us four different sports so define the

1203
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:58,780
four different sports so define the covariance of the join vector X which we

1204
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,630
covariance of the join vector X which we need this you need to complete you and

1205
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:03,310
need this you need to complete you and use in terms of the weights and you need

1206
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:07,180
use in terms of the weights and you need s a nest of the noise body world the

1207
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,520
s a nest of the noise body world the noise standard deviations of the

1208
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,710
noise standard deviations of the conditional distributions so now the

1209
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:14,079
conditional distributions so now the pension calculation solo very cash

1210
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:16,150
pension calculation solo very cash investors disappeared with one trick and

1211
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:19,569
investors disappeared with one trick and the trick is to work not through the

1212
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:21,400
the trick is to work not through the experiments but with the X minus mu

1213
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:29,859
experiments but with the X minus mu value okay so say q1 we need to

1214
01:07:29,859 --> 01:07:31,540
value okay so say q1 we need to implement this linear Gaussian model

1215
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:35,829
implement this linear Gaussian model this is photo to the busiest way you can

1216
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:39,640
this is photo to the busiest way you can get basically the expectations the way

1217
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,710
get basically the expectations the way we did in the earlier slide expectations

1218
01:07:41,710 --> 01:08:25,809
we did in the earlier slide expectations are very easy to do I was really compact

1219
01:08:25,809 --> 01:08:31,959
are very easy to do I was really compact so for example at this trivial case when

1220
01:08:31,959 --> 01:08:35,019
so for example at this trivial case when you collect data x1 to xn and they all

1221
01:08:35,019 --> 01:08:37,240
you collect data x1 to xn and they all come up from some distribution of some

1222
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,550
come up from some distribution of some unknown parameter theta a good way to

1223
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:42,070
unknown parameter theta a good way to represent this so here actually I should

1224
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:44,410
represent this so here actually I should have notes right is X 2 here X 3

1225
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:47,140
have notes right is X 2 here X 3 etcetera xn so a good way to represent

1226
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:50,320
etcetera xn so a good way to represent compound in a compact fashion list is to

1227
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:54,910
compound in a compact fashion list is to represent this with a presentation the

1228
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:59,039
represent this with a presentation the vs. follows you from the backside at X I

1229
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:01,450
vs. follows you from the backside at X I and you indicate that you have n

1230
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:04,900
and you indicate that you have n instances of X all right

1231
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:08,320
instances of X all right you have any generalizations of X I and

1232
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,470
you have any generalizations of X I and all of these realizations have the same

1233
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:13,599
all of these realizations have the same theta when they come from the same

1234
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,039
theta when they come from the same distribution that there's a parameter

1235
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:17,740
distribution that there's a parameter theta so theta has to be outside the box

1236
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:20,470
theta so theta has to be outside the box because only thing things inside the

1237
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:23,110
because only thing things inside the battery repeat things outside the next

1238
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:27,550
battery repeat things outside the next are basically independent of hi okay so

1239
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:32,559
are basically independent of hi okay so this is basically equivalent to the

1240
01:09:32,559 --> 01:09:36,190
this is basically equivalent to the notation that you see here for simple

1241
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:38,320
notation that you see here for simple problems you can do this for more

1242
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,720
problems you can do this for more complicated problems this may be candy

1243
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,240
complicated problems this may be candy but you have to do it carefully because

1244
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,070
but you have to do it carefully because some of these boxes and complicated

1245
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:48,370
some of these boxes and complicated distributions may be nested and you can

1246
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:54,729
distributions may be nested and you can sort of come up with wrong with you know

1247
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:56,380
sort of come up with wrong with you know the wrong conclusions because your

1248
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:58,990
the wrong conclusions because your distribution represented by this graph

1249
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:02,050
distribution represented by this graph of this graph is not the same so in this

1250
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:05,680
of this graph is not the same so in this case if you interested in the Joint

1251
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,450
case if you interested in the Joint Distribution of all the variables the

1252
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:20,050
Distribution of all the variables the next time and then you have n instances

1253
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:23,080
next time and then you have n instances of the probability of X i given theta

1254
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,420
of the probability of X i given theta which we see with this product here so

1255
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,430
which we see with this product here so this is the joint distribution and it's

1256
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:28,959
this is the joint distribution and it's really identical to the Joint

1257
01:10:28,959 --> 01:10:32,530
really identical to the Joint Distribution of Yashida okay so this

1258
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:35,380
Distribution of Yashida okay so this again it's a more compact way and it's

1259
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:36,729
again it's a more compact way and it's called the plate notation for

1260
01:10:36,729 --> 01:10:42,960
called the plate notation for representing graphical models

1261
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:42,970


1262
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:46,500
all right

1263
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:46,510


1264
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:52,229
so if this don't extend come from adoption that has some unknown the mean

1265
01:10:52,229 --> 01:10:55,080
adoption that has some unknown the mean and variance that same your standard

1266
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,300
and variance that same your standard deviation Sigma this is the plate

1267
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:02,340
deviation Sigma this is the plate notation for representing some good data

1268
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,840
notation for representing some good data from this Gaussian with parameters mu

1269
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,310
from this Gaussian with parameters mu and Sigma all right so the Joint

1270
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:08,400
and Sigma all right so the Joint Distribution is for unity of Sigma and

1271
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,100
Distribution is for unity of Sigma and then you have M installations of the

1272
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:15,090
then you have M installations of the probability of x given mu and Sigma or

1273
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:18,330
probability of x given mu and Sigma or additionally to parents so this is a

1274
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:21,030
additionally to parents so this is a reduction the amount disruption where we

1275
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:22,710
reduction the amount disruption where we have one of this you know everything

1276
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:25,260
have one of this you know everything indicating that every node X depends

1277
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,210
indicating that every node X depends from you know Sigma or you prefer this

1278
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:35,430
from you know Sigma or you prefer this mister screen notation okay so let me

1279
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:35,820
mister screen notation okay so let me finish

1280
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:40,170
finish we have exactly five minutes again for

1281
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,090
we have exactly five minutes again for those who have not seen regression

1282
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:46,350
those who have not seen regression models I will suggest that you look on

1283
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:51,950
models I will suggest that you look on on my lecture in you know in the poll

1284
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:56,460
on my lecture in you know in the poll and the exact same problem basically

1285
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,350
and the exact same problem basically limitation I don't think we're going to

1286
01:11:58,350 --> 01:11:59,910
limitation I don't think we're going to come back to the aggression problems in

1287
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:02,910
come back to the aggression problems in this course but right now I just want to

1288
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:06,300
this course but right now I just want to give you a modular presentation of for

1289
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,130
give you a modular presentation of for regression for base and regression to

1290
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:12,840
regression for base and regression to see how it works like so today we are

1291
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,080
see how it works like so today we are given some data and T are the positive

1292
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,700
given some data and T are the positive values and we try to the division

1293
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,070
values and we try to the division fitting in the sense that for some unix

1294
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:25,050
fitting in the sense that for some unix we want to be able to predict the value

1295
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:28,229
we want to be able to predict the value of T and also the uncertainty in T so we

1296
01:12:28,229 --> 01:12:33,120
of T and also the uncertainty in T so we come up with integration function that

1297
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,850
come up with integration function that this basically in this case a linear

1298
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:47,550
this basically in this case a linear model okay so WI x 6i okay and least

1299
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:50,160
model okay so WI x 6i okay and least this coefficients table review we take

1300
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,720
this coefficients table review we take them as random bottom so they're gonna

1301
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:55,260
them as random bottom so they're gonna put some flour on them all right and so

1302
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:59,850
put some flour on them all right and so the giant probability of tmw is you can

1303
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:03,210
the giant probability of tmw is you can think of being our measurements of some

1304
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:06,090
think of being our measurements of some given points X but in this equation is

1305
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:09,360
given points X but in this equation is not strong but the Joint Distribution of

1306
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,790
not strong but the Joint Distribution of what they have observed which is T and

1307
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:13,860
what they have observed which is T and of this on all kilometers lovely you is

1308
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,980
of this on all kilometers lovely you is the prior in boundary times the

1309
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:20,460
the prior in boundary times the likelihood of each data point TN with

1310
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:24,630
likelihood of each data point TN with known parameters so this is how the

1311
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:26,010
known parameters so this is how the aggression more than reaching the

1312
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:29,280
aggression more than reaching the standard sense all right this are the

1313
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:33,660
standard sense all right this are the observations T the parameters WL unknown

1314
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:34,950
observations T the parameters WL unknown all right

1315
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:38,610
all right so for every given X but the graph

1316
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:41,310
so for every given X but the graph wasn't so much and I emphasize this I

1317
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:44,670
wasn't so much and I emphasize this I need to know what values of T 1 depends

1318
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,980
need to know what values of T 1 depends on WT to defense of W so this is the

1319
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:49,410
on WT to defense of W so this is the graphical representation in a period

1320
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:54,810
graphical representation in a period called it becomes trivial and to make it

1321
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:56,880
called it becomes trivial and to make it interesting and this is the type of

1322
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:04,380
interesting and this is the type of relationship problem we did last it has

1323
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:07,260
relationship problem we did last it has high parameters to me and we almost have

1324
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:10,050
high parameters to me and we almost have the parameters alpha and if you also

1325
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:13,230
the parameters alpha and if you also want to make this values of P n to be

1326
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:15,870
want to make this values of P n to be noisy with some unknown noise Sigma

1327
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:18,420
noisy with some unknown noise Sigma square then this is the very general

1328
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,580
square then this is the very general description of a Bayesian regression

1329
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:24,090
description of a Bayesian regression model okay I know there is a lot there

1330
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:26,130
model okay I know there is a lot there but you may need to study

1331
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:30,540
but you may need to study all right but the equation is for every

1332
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:34,440
all right but the equation is for every extent all right I measured the end and

1333
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:40,770
extent all right I measured the end and my actual you know function very

1334
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:42,450
my actual you know function very especially from the end by some noise

1335
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:46,100
especially from the end by some noise Sigma square that I got of what it is ok

1336
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:48,420
Sigma square that I got of what it is ok in my regression model I need these

1337
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:52,320
in my regression model I need these coefficients w all right that define my

1338
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,600
coefficients w all right that define my regression function and

1339
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,810
regression function and the memory is the same regardless of n

1340
01:14:57,810 --> 01:15:01,320
the memory is the same regardless of n little n and because I put a prior LW

1341
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,810
little n and because I put a prior LW that has some macabre parameter salsa I

1342
01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:06,090
that has some macabre parameter salsa I need to basically have an arrow from

1343
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:12,810
need to basically have an arrow from alpha to W so this model represents the

1344
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:14,630
alpha to W so this model represents the joint distribution that looks like this

1345
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:15,810
joint distribution that looks like this okay

1346
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:22,410
okay again there is rare right so this is the

1347
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:24,780
again there is rare right so this is the joint distribution of things I observed

1348
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:27,990
joint distribution of things I observed which is this noisy function evaluations

1349
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:30,420
which is this noisy function evaluations and the parameters given the inputs X

1350
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:34,320
and the parameters given the inputs X now the inputs come here this kind of

1351
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,940
now the inputs come here this kind of economic the social time given the no

1352
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:38,670
economic the social time given the no single square I don't know and the Joint

1353
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:40,530
single square I don't know and the Joint Distribution you can read it from the

1354
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:42,960
Distribution you can read it from the graph but for those who have never seen

1355
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,030
graph but for those who have never seen this glass before and they know about

1356
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:48,200
this glass before and they know about regression basically this is the power

1357
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,630
regression basically this is the power the Joint Distribution is the player

1358
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:52,980
the Joint Distribution is the player this is you can think of this portray

1359
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:54,870
this is you can think of this portray the Joint Distribution as the UH

1360
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:59,100
the Joint Distribution as the UH normalize for studio all right okay so

1361
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:02,150
normalize for studio all right okay so it is the prior the depends on Alpha

1362
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:05,610
it is the prior the depends on Alpha like that that part of it lock and then

1363
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:07,980
like that that part of it lock and then you have the right we could model that

1364
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,260
you have the right we could model that gives you the probability of TN give an

1365
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,300
gives you the probability of TN give an extent but that probability depends of

1366
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,280
extent but that probability depends of the noise Sigma square and the function

1367
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:20,400
the noise Sigma square and the function W so effectively we don't have to write

1368
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,340
W so effectively we don't have to write this lengthy equation if I look at this

1369
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:25,830
this lengthy equation if I look at this graph I know what is going on and I know

1370
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,990
graph I know what is going on and I know where the problem is and that's why when

1371
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:29,430
where the problem is and that's why when you've got the homework problem Subic

1372
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:32,160
you've got the homework problem Subic said they know everything so let me give

1373
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,080
said they know everything so let me give the report then you figure out what it

1374
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,480
the report then you figure out what it means says here is an equation here's a

1375
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,360
means says here is an equation here's a plot going away the problem to do this

1376
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,880
plot going away the problem to do this okay so what program basically we need

1377
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,190
okay so what program basically we need to require that you understand that this

1378
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:48,600
to require that you understand that this graph implies all of this ok now in

1379
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:53,129
graph implies all of this ok now in is there is nothing for predictions

1380
01:16:53,129 --> 01:16:55,950
is there is nothing for predictions basically it has only the information

1381
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:59,339
basically it has only the information the values for training the T values and

1382
01:16:59,339 --> 01:17:03,149
the values for training the T values and the X values the prior tsunami but

1383
01:17:03,149 --> 01:17:04,560
the X values the prior tsunami but there's nothing of prediction so if you

1384
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,589
there's nothing of prediction so if you want to add things for prediction so

1385
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:10,379
want to add things for prediction so don't let's say not going to train the

1386
01:17:10,379 --> 01:17:13,260
don't let's say not going to train the model but also today both for a new X to

1387
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:16,260
model but also today both for a new X to predict what the value of the function

1388
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:19,410
predict what the value of the function is the heart this is the whole diagram

1389
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:22,410
is the heart this is the whole diagram that includes the joint probability

1390
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:24,810
that includes the joint probability distribution of everything so the

1391
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:29,069
distribution of everything so the distribution of W the take data that you

1392
01:17:29,069 --> 01:17:31,260
distribution of W the take data that you gave but also the prediction T that you

1393
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:34,229
gave but also the prediction T that you want to do at that point X and you

1394
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:37,140
want to do at that point X and you notice it contains the ANOVA lies

1395
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:40,319
notice it contains the ANOVA lies posterior which is the prior times the

1396
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:42,330
posterior which is the prior times the likelihood all right this comes again

1397
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:45,120
likelihood all right this comes again from what we did before but also now it

1398
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,450
from what we did before but also now it has so this is sort of where you know

1399
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:51,689
has so this is sort of where you know the posterior value you literally times

1400
01:17:51,689 --> 01:17:54,359
the posterior value you literally times the likelihood okay and the likelihood

1401
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:57,810
the likelihood okay and the likelihood from the prediction point is between UW

1402
01:17:57,810 --> 01:18:01,110
from the prediction point is between UW and she was square for my
