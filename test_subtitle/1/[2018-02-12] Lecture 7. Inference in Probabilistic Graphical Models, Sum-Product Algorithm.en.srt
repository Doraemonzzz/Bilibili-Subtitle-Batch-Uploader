1
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:43,770
all right let's see as you know the second homework has less time for you to

2
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,170
second homework has less time for you to work simply because I want to be sure

3
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,309
work simply because I want to be sure that we at least cover 6 homework 9 I

4
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:51,870
that we at least cover 6 homework 9 I noticed some of you don't bother about

5
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,690
noticed some of you don't bother about homework because you're auditing the

6
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:03,570
homework because you're auditing the class disappointed to hear that okay

7
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:03,580


8
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:10,590
a recommendation when we post home most keep revisiting them because when I get

9
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,930
keep revisiting them because when I get comments from students from when I look

10
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,960
comments from students from when I look back I go directly and who changes their

11
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,640
back I go directly and who changes their and I don't want to keep sending

12
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,920
and I don't want to keep sending messages saying we change this and that

13
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,820
messages saying we change this and that so please you know look on the website

14
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:30,360
so please you know look on the website for changes okay so we talked about the

15
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,860
for changes okay so we talked about the elimination algorithm last week both for

16
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,920
elimination algorithm last week both for directed or undirected graphs and today

17
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,720
directed or undirected graphs and today we want sort of to revisit the

18
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,930
we want sort of to revisit the elimination algorithm but put it on a

19
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,300
elimination algorithm but put it on a form that is related to what's called

20
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,520
form that is related to what's called message passing and the Beyonder that

21
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,180
message passing and the Beyonder that goes through this name is called the

22
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,380
goes through this name is called the Stamper of the algorithm in essence is

23
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,660
Stamper of the algorithm in essence is the same sort of a state elimination

24
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,569
the same sort of a state elimination algorithm but read people way more

25
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:08,009
algorithm but read people way more efficient depending on what type of so

26
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:10,620
efficient depending on what type of so we're going to apply this first to twist

27
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,400
we're going to apply this first to twist and then next week we will extend it to

28
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,490
and then next week we will extend it to general graph so actually when we apply

29
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,069
general graph so actually when we apply it brings me we see that this algorithms

30
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:22,529
it brings me we see that this algorithms are really exact incredible items so

31
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,890
are really exact incredible items so there are no proximation to be done

32
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:32,790
there are no proximation to be done right so let me bring out some of the

33
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,159
right so let me bring out some of the basic ideas we have seen with the

34
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:38,640
basic ideas we have seen with the elimination algorithm so here is the

35
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,320
elimination algorithm so here is the directed graph 5 note this is the

36
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,779
directed graph 5 note this is the decomposition of the joint the total

37
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:47,189
decomposition of the joint the total ization of the joint applied by the

38
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:52,439
ization of the joint applied by the graph and let's say that the inference

39
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,960
graph and let's say that the inference asked that were interested is to compute

40
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,749
asked that were interested is to compute the probability of pay given the Capital

41
00:04:57,749 --> 00:05:02,040
the probability of pay given the Capital steez needle stick okay so you know so

42
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,450
steez needle stick okay so you know so this is the problem actually we have

43
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,010
this is the problem actually we have discussed up to now for several lectures

44
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:11,010
discussed up to now for several lectures so obviously you know you know you can

45
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,450
so obviously you know you know you can start completing this conditional using

46
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,100
start completing this conditional using this factorization and this is going to

47
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,930
this factorization and this is going to be elective process so let's check how

48
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,150
be elective process so let's check how you're going to do this with 20 of

49
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,930
you're going to do this with 20 of resistance so to complete this you will

50
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,650
resistance so to complete this you will need to compute the jointer plane three

51
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,260
need to compute the jointer plane three divided by the probability of capital C

52
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,650
divided by the probability of capital C being the trustee to compute the joint

53
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,439
being the trustee to compute the joint of a entity series and evidence killed

54
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,930
of a entity series and evidence killed equal to little T obviously you're going

55
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,080
equal to little T obviously you're going to have to take this join distribution

56
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,879
to have to take this join distribution of ABCDE and marginalize out BD any so

57
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,409
of ABCDE and marginalize out BD any so you have to perform this operation of

58
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:52,379
you have to perform this operation of this here and if we assume that these

59
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:57,050
this here and if we assume that these variables are all binary you will need

60
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,629
variables are all binary you will need two terms from B two terms for these two

61
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:04,290
two terms from B two terms for these two terms for e so eight terms and you need

62
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,180
terms for e so eight terms and you need to compute the same terms for each of

63
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,029
to compute the same terms for each of the values of a which are two so this

64
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:15,180
the values of a which are two so this calculation is 16 operation okay so this

65
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,149
calculation is 16 operation okay so this is what you seal the you know the

66
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:21,750
is what you seal the you know the numerator here to compute this you will

67
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,480
numerator here to compute this you will have to do marginalization a okay so

68
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,149
have to do marginalization a okay so that's two operations and to compute

69
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:29,010
that's two operations and to compute this ratio you have to compute this for

70
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,470
this ratio you have to compute this for every value of pay in order to operation

71
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,630
every value of pay in order to operation so if the calculation count is correct

72
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,550
so if the calculation count is correct you need 20 operations basically to do

73
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,710
you need 20 operations basically to do this right so the more efficient method

74
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,260
this right so the more efficient method based on the elimination when we discuss

75
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,880
based on the elimination when we discuss is to actually compute this by pushing

76
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,920
is to actually compute this by pushing forward some of the summation so now if

77
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,260
forward some of the summation so now if you notice I put the semester only on

78
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,860
you notice I put the semester only on this peril reservation on the investor

79
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,450
this peril reservation on the investor all the terms come from the factories

80
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,410
all the terms come from the factories ation of the joint and by magic because

81
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,630
ation of the joint and by magic because these are conditional distributions this

82
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,870
these are conditional distributions this term is equal to 1 this term is equal to

83
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,940
term is equal to 1 this term is equal to 1 and the only thing you have to compute

84
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,850
1 and the only thing you have to compute is literation right so two values of B

85
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,980
is literation right so two values of B and you have to compute them for two

86
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,480
and you have to compute them for two values to pay this is only for

87
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,450
values to pay this is only for operations and if you look back this was

88
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,410
operations and if you look back this was 16 operations right so basically the

89
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,930
16 operations right so basically the elimination algorithm now allows us to

90
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,200
elimination algorithm now allows us to compute this marginals things like this

91
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,690
compute this marginals things like this in a way more efficient way than just

92
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,010
in a way more efficient way than just doing you know multi-generation using

93
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,540
doing you know multi-generation using this factorization implied by the graph

94
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,570
this factorization implied by the graph alright so 20 operations if you don't do

95
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,970
alright so 20 operations if you don't do anything special if you use the

96
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,910
anything special if you use the elimination algorithm for this directed

97
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,070
elimination algorithm for this directed graph you only get this in eight

98
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,610
graph you only get this in eight operations eight operations because this

99
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,320
operations eight operations because this is for than the other two steps are

100
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,810
is for than the other two steps are basically identical less so there is a

101
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,460
basically identical less so there is a problem with this algorithms with

102
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,950
problem with this algorithms with elimination algorithm and the problem is

103
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,830
elimination algorithm and the problem is that we focus on calculating one

104
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,180
that we focus on calculating one marginal or unconditional distribution

105
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,360
marginal or unconditional distribution of the time all right so in this problem

106
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,820
of the time all right so in this problem if let's say your objective is to

107
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,520
if let's say your objective is to calculate I don't know the probability

108
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,070
calculate I don't know the probability of being given streak one little tree

109
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,870
of being given streak one little tree you will have to repeat this from

110
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,470
you will have to repeat this from scratch

111
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,560
scratch that's waste of time so the algorithms

112
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,530
that's waste of time so the algorithms we will discuss today is how do we

113
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,510
we will discuss today is how do we complete not just let's say one

114
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,260
complete not just let's say one condition

115
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,660
or one marginal but other conditionals are all marginal in the graph all

116
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,970
are all marginal in the graph all applaud so given the evidence

117
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,800
applaud so given the evidence what's the conditional distribution of

118
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,340
what's the conditional distribution of 40 other notes okay one at the time can

119
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,360
40 other notes okay one at the time can we do this more efficiently without

120
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,390
we do this more efficiently without having to repeat this for every case in

121
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,670
having to repeat this for every case in principle can we do some calculations

122
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:08,040
principle can we do some calculations that can be recycled as we compute one

123
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,740
that can be recycled as we compute one marginal or one conditional at the time

124
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,500
marginal or one conditional at the time can we recycle some calculations and the

125
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,160
can we recycle some calculations and the operation that we discuss today it's

126
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,720
operation that we discuss today it's basically sub chaser for the score

127
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,260
basically sub chaser for the score belief propagation methods okay but

128
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,840
belief propagation methods okay but today what we will see is exactly the

129
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,010
today what we will see is exactly the wave propagation in tricks okay so you

130
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,720
wave propagation in tricks okay so you will see mathematically there is really

131
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,130
will see mathematically there is really no new techniques on what we will

132
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,650
no new techniques on what we will discuss but the algorithm is way more

133
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,010
discuss but the algorithm is way more Christians and elimination of so any

134
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,690
Christians and elimination of so any questions with what we have seen up to

135
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,450
questions with what we have seen up to now with the elimination algorithm for

136
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,410
now with the elimination algorithm for directed or undirected graphs okay so

137
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,640
directed or undirected graphs okay so some kind of thing I have a repeat of

138
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,550
some kind of thing I have a repeat of the algorithm again but we still Isis

139
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:56,490
the algorithm again but we still Isis will go so the idea is to you know

140
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,140
will go so the idea is to you know remember when we did the elimination

141
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,510
remember when we did the elimination algorithm we calculated a lots of

142
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,420
algorithm we calculated a lots of intermediate factors so the adage can we

143
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,570
intermediate factors so the adage can we really use those intravenous factors to

144
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,760
really use those intravenous factors to compute multiple Martinez at the same

145
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,360
compute multiple Martinez at the same time and we will do this today but only

146
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,980
time and we will do this today but only we will do this for priests and three

147
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,200
we will do this for priests and three like graphs

148
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,110
like graphs okay if you try to do this for general

149
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,990
okay if you try to do this for general graphs basically the algorithm needs to

150
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,510
graphs basically the algorithm needs to lots of modifications and the algorithm

151
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,550
lots of modifications and the algorithm we go the general average wanted the

152
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,820
we go the general average wanted the name Junction tree algorithm okay and we

153
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,630
name Junction tree algorithm okay and we will discuss this next next week so

154
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,370
will discuss this next next week so right now we will concentrate on three

155
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,860
right now we will concentrate on three stand three like graphs

156
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,360
stand three like graphs and we received wiser so let's turn

157
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,530
and we received wiser so let's turn motivate what's going on with a little

158
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:48,980
motivate what's going on with a little chain so let's say we have the joint

159
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,340
chain so let's say we have the joint distribution of x1 to xn and we want to

160
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,680
distribution of x1 to xn and we want to compute the marginal distribution of

161
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,040
compute the marginal distribution of literary note the extent but we wanted

162
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,050
literary note the extent but we wanted to compute in a way that will allow us

163
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,090
to compute in a way that will allow us almost no additional costs to compute

164
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,710
almost no additional costs to compute the marginal support of the other notes

165
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,890
the marginal support of the other notes as well so we're going to do this

166
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,360
as well so we're going to do this calculation in a little bit more

167
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,750
calculation in a little bit more efficient way than we have done before

168
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,720
efficient way than we have done before so perfect I am taking the maximal

169
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,840
so perfect I am taking the maximal cliques here - or for this bill so I

170
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,329
cliques here - or for this bill so I write the effectors this undirected

171
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:25,370
write the effectors this undirected graph is the potential of the nodes 1 &amp;

172
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,550
graph is the potential of the nodes 1 &amp; 2 2 &amp; 3 and minus 1 and then and and

173
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,470
2 2 &amp; 3 and minus 1 and then and and because these are not probabilities

174
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,880
because these are not probabilities argue the factorization I use the an

175
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,700
argue the factorization I use the an organization factor T there to take care

176
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,090
organization factor T there to take care but this product basically one of us he

177
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,310
but this product basically one of us he gives me a value all right so this guy

178
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,079
gives me a value all right so this guy in the question below

179
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,880
in the question below it's sort of an elimination algorithm

180
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,370
it's sort of an elimination algorithm but very much different from what we

181
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:57,350
but very much different from what we have seen up to now with the elimination

182
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,180
have seen up to now with the elimination both of the resident of directed graphs

183
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,910
both of the resident of directed graphs so I want you to look at this equation

184
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,430
so I want you to look at this equation and tell me what is different you know

185
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,470
and tell me what is different you know this I have two terms one on the top and

186
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,540
this I have two terms one on the top and one on the bottom

187
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,000
one on the bottom alright and I remind you the extend

188
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,400
alright and I remind you the extend means I have to integrate on all

189
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,490
means I have to integrate on all variables what extent and this is what I

190
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,560
variables what extent and this is what I have done here but I have done it in

191
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,079
have done here but I have done it in some specific order so I want you to

192
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:24,050
some specific order so I want you to tell me what this is special there in

193
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,699
tell me what this is special there in the order and how is that different from

194
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:30,110
the order and how is that different from before so the node exchange some quality

195
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,360
before so the node exchange some quality on the middle somewhere there it doesn't

196
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,590
on the middle somewhere there it doesn't have to be in the middle but it's

197
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:38,970
have to be in the middle but it's somewhere in between

198
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:38,980


199
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:45,360
so on the first summation I am starting something from the right to the left

200
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,280
something from the right to the left from summing from x1 to x2 to xn minus 1

201
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,090
from summing from x1 to x2 to xn minus 1 so I am propagating information from X

202
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,329
so I am propagating information from X run all the way to excel all right and

203
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,550
run all the way to excel all right and look now in the summation on the bottom

204
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,400
look now in the summation on the bottom I have rearranged it in such a way that

205
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,370
I have rearranged it in such a way that the first terminal Excel then on X X

206
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,790
the first terminal Excel then on X X capital n the next capital n minus 1 all

207
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,499
capital n the next capital n minus 1 all the way to extend so I propagate

208
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:15,730
the way to extend so I propagate information from X capital n to excess

209
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,920
information from X capital n to excess so I propagate from the right to the

210
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,290
so I propagate from the right to the next step so there is a portable

211
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,509
next step so there is a portable propagation of information to node X N

212
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:25,180
propagation of information to node X N and there is a marker propagation of

213
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,050
and there is a marker propagation of information from the last node X capital

214
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,800
information from the last node X capital of time ok so this is not similar to

215
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,269
of time ok so this is not similar to what we did with the elimination

216
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:35,680
what we did with the elimination algorithm right where we start

217
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,759
algorithm right where we start eliminating with some order here we are

218
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,749
eliminating with some order here we are sending messages from the left and we

219
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:45,220
sending messages from the left and we are sending message from the right and

220
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,809
are sending message from the right and I'm going to define what this messages

221
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:49,120
I'm going to define what this messages are and actually the definition to start

222
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,870
are and actually the definition to start with the message that is being sent from

223
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,920
with the message that is being sent from the left to node X n is denoted here mu

224
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,220
the left to node X n is denoted here mu alpha of X 10 is the function of xn is

225
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,340
alpha of X 10 is the function of xn is basically or is the product of all the

226
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,120
basically or is the product of all the potentials to the left of the node X 10

227
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,679
potentials to the left of the node X 10 where all the other variables for the

228
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:14,019
where all the other variables for the chain have been some towers okay and if

229
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,809
chain have been some towers okay and if mu beta is the father of all the terms

230
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:19,269
mu beta is the father of all the terms to the right where everything has been

231
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:21,699
to the right where everything has been somehow from xn plus 1 to X capital n

232
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:27,420
somehow from xn plus 1 to X capital n except little XL okay but it is not just

233
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,650
except little XL okay but it is not just simple definition here right the

234
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,319
simple definition here right the definition implies the destinations this

235
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:36,189
definition implies the destinations this calculation happens in the proper way

236
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:38,559
calculation happens in the proper way that you see here that implies some

237
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,350
that you see here that implies some recursive relations for this message

238
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,120
recursive relations for this message this new

239
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,890
this new new beta and I'm gonna write those

240
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,620
new beta and I'm gonna write those recursive relationship one second okay

241
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,430
recursive relationship one second okay so look carefully at this equation earth

242
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,120
so look carefully at this equation earth right we define this to be mu alpha and

243
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,230
right we define this to be mu alpha and I denoted here is basically we call it

244
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,920
I denoted here is basically we call it the masters that is tenth two from the

245
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,980
the masters that is tenth two from the left that's alpha the notation used by

246
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,700
left that's alpha the notation used by bishop to the node extent and mu beta is

247
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,430
bishop to the node extent and mu beta is the message sent by the notes to the

248
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,860
the message sent by the notes to the right of return okay

249
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,600
right of return okay and the definition is what you see here

250
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,120
and the definition is what you see here and the master comes to be basically the

251
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,400
and the master comes to be basically the product of new alpha times mu beta

252
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,890
product of new alpha times mu beta divided by the normalization factor of Z

253
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,280
divided by the normalization factor of Z so effectively if you want to calculate

254
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,390
so effectively if you want to calculate with this definition the P of X then

255
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,670
with this definition the P of X then what you need to do is calculate this

256
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,430
what you need to do is calculate this message me alpha by beta of Excel and

257
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,500
message me alpha by beta of Excel and then multiply them and normalize them

258
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,810
then multiply them and normalize them and you're done

259
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,460
and you're done so before it's in slide that I give you

260
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,350
so before it's in slide that I give you the the recursive relationship from your

261
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,510
the the recursive relationship from your from your beta can you just you know can

262
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:53,490
from your beta can you just you know can you guess the well the recursive

263
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,770
you guess the well the recursive relation you can take here but what I

264
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:01,800
relation you can take here but what I was going to ask you well can you guess

265
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,430
was going to ask you well can you guess how this can reduce information that the

266
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,480
how this can reduce information that the elimination algorithm could not do I

267
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,640
elimination algorithm could not do I mean look at this the way that these

268
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,980
mean look at this the way that these messages you know when you know this

269
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,990
messages you know when you know this message like that right so it you also

270
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,540
message like that right so it you also but also I put the similar definition of

271
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,330
but also I put the similar definition of new Alpha X n minus 1 which will be the

272
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,250
new Alpha X n minus 1 which will be the product of all the potentials from the

273
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,040
product of all the potentials from the left alright so as I go forward from x1

274
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,240
left alright so as I go forward from x1 to xn minus 1 with all the variables

275
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,650
to xn minus 1 with all the variables eliminated but the x10 - wrong left

276
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:35,160
eliminated but the x10 - wrong left totally okay so can you see a way where

277
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,560
totally okay so can you see a way where somehow this one where it will be way

278
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,470
somehow this one where it will be way more efficient than integration are

279
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,159
more efficient than integration are and will allow me using this ideation of

280
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,859
and will allow me using this ideation of this derivation to compute the marginal

281
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:48,139
this derivation to compute the marginal of all the nodes in the graph not one

282
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:54,650
of all the nodes in the graph not one but all what will be the new algorithm

283
00:16:54,650 --> 00:17:00,019
but all what will be the new algorithm that we can think about in other ways if

284
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,840
that we can think about in other ways if my interest is not the marginal of X 10

285
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,809
my interest is not the marginal of X 10 but the marginal of xn minus 1 according

286
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:08,779
but the marginal of xn minus 1 according to this derivation how do we compute the

287
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:15,230
to this derivation how do we compute the marginal of xn minus 1 according to this

288
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,400
marginal of xn minus 1 according to this point will be

289
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,410


290
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:24,860
I put some of the arrows here I haven't put all the arrows there so how do we

291
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,790
put all the arrows there so how do we compute the marginal of xn minus 1 will

292
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,730
compute the marginal of xn minus 1 will be Miller part of which the function of

293
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,800
be Miller part of which the function of xn minus 1 multiplied with me because

294
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,870
xn minus 1 multiplied with me because the nest is that goes to xn minus 1 from

295
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,580
the nest is that goes to xn minus 1 from the right which is an arrow that would

296
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,660
the right which is an arrow that would be message that goes this way correct

297
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,860
be message that goes this way correct this different ways

298
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,110
this different ways noiseless algorithm that I come to be

299
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,930
noiseless algorithm that I come to be more efficient what the algorithm is

300
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,660
more efficient what the algorithm is going to be like that will allow me to

301
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:59,810
going to be like that will allow me to compute all the marginals that was well

302
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,000
compute all the marginals that was well the algorithm will be complete all the

303
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,360
the algorithm will be complete all the messages it's forward from left right

304
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,710
messages it's forward from left right compute all the messages backwards from

305
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,800
compute all the messages backwards from right to left and then basically you go

306
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,000
right to left and then basically you go at any node and you actually can compute

307
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,150
at any node and you actually can compute the the marginals by multiplying the

308
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,490
the the marginals by multiplying the messages arriving the update at least

309
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,520
messages arriving the update at least know they often veto messages and the

310
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,410
know they often veto messages and the normalization factor how many times they

311
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,770
normalization factor how many times they have to compute it you know they scared

312
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,740
have to compute it you know they scared well I did not put Z annulation like

313
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,540
well I did not put Z annulation like that but you know the organization

314
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,060
that but you know the organization particle often we have the romanization

315
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,730
particle often we have the romanization factor actually comes here from query

316
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,520
factor actually comes here from query comes from here from the joint so how

317
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,320
comes from here from the joint so how many times you know the romanization

318
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,120
many times you know the romanization factor with check for this case would be

319
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,460
factor with check for this case would be take this product sum it up for all

320
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,520
take this product sum it up for all values of X 10 knots T so how often you

321
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,169
values of X 10 knots T so how often you have to compute

322
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:53,179


323
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:58,419
like we'd be another normalization factor for xn minus 1 4 X 1 X capital n

324
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:04,089
factor for xn minus 1 4 X 1 X capital n no so so 6 computed what okay so what we

325
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:07,389
no so so 6 computed what okay so what we need to do now is we need to see if this

326
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:09,909
need to do now is we need to see if this definition of new alpha and the

327
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:11,529
definition of new alpha and the definition of new beta can be written

328
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:14,799
definition of new beta can be written down in a way that is sort of recursive

329
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:21,070
down in a way that is sort of recursive so you can have a nice angle so let's

330
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,959
so you can have a nice angle so let's concentrate on me all right so on so the

331
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,479
concentrate on me all right so on so the new alpha here is also you know this

332
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:31,779
new alpha here is also you know this summation of everything except extend of

333
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:34,060
summation of everything except extend of all the potentials to the left of extend

334
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,919
all the potentials to the left of extend okay so summation of xn minus 1 and

335
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,419
okay so summation of xn minus 1 and somewhere here the decimation of xn

336
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:45,399
somewhere here the decimation of xn minus 2 etc I want you to think visually

337
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:48,089
minus 2 etc I want you to think visually all right looking on on this definition

338
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,499
all right looking on on this definition here I'm gonna have summation of xn

339
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:54,869
here I'm gonna have summation of xn minus 2 then X and minus 3 and then X 1

340
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:58,119
minus 2 then X and minus 3 and then X 1 can you tell me more about summation

341
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:00,899
can you tell me more about summation starting from xn minus 2 what is that

342
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,549
starting from xn minus 2 what is that what's the name of of summation if the

343
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:09,039
what's the name of of summation if the name of this is New York off Excel the

344
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,470
name of this is New York off Excel the deen-ul-haq

345
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:12,480


346
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,220
exhale minus one so basically the encapsulation for the operating system

347
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,920
encapsulation for the operating system right so if you want to compute me Ralph

348
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,200
right so if you want to compute me Ralph Excel what you need to do is sum of

349
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,040
Excel what you need to do is sum of extent - one of the potential the joint

350
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,710
extent - one of the potential the joint xn minus 1 in extender which is this you

351
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,020
xn minus 1 in extender which is this you remember here that's about potential

352
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,350
remember here that's about potential times that summation that we told me

353
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,020
times that summation that we told me starting with xn minus 2 all the way to

354
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,020
starting with xn minus 2 all the way to X - 1 and that's the message near alpha

355
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,570
X - 1 and that's the message near alpha text and minus 1 very easy actually to

356
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,240
text and minus 1 very easy actually to visualize no questions I actually when I

357
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,890
visualize no questions I actually when I look at this right I don't look at the

358
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,590
look at this right I don't look at the equation because the completeness method

359
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,490
equation because the completeness method it's really the message of can stream

360
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,130
it's really the message of can stream which is you know alpha text n minus 1

361
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,530
which is you know alpha text n minus 1 times this potential and then extra one

362
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,840
times this potential and then extra one has to be integrated out because u alpha

363
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,690
has to be integrated out because u alpha is a function of X N and that's it okay

364
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,250
is a function of X N and that's it okay and similarly if you want the message me

365
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,110
and similarly if you want the message me with a recursive relation with Excel

366
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,540
with a recursive relation with Excel would be the message coming out from the

367
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,540
would be the message coming out from the rival function of xn plus 1 times the

368
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,240
rival function of xn plus 1 times the potential of xn xn plus 1 and then we

369
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,090
potential of xn xn plus 1 and then we integrate out xn plus 1 and that's the

370
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,910
integrate out xn plus 1 and that's the recursive relation okay in this chart

371
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,030
recursive relation okay in this chart the chapman-kolmogorov relations that

372
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:33,020
the chapman-kolmogorov relations that sort of appear not only the context of

373
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,210
sort of appear not only the context of belief propagation but you know many

374
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,380
belief propagation but you know many other areas in automatics for those who

375
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,990
other areas in automatics for those who are you know study dynamic programming

376
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,880
are you know study dynamic programming sort of the substandard equations we

377
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,070
sort of the substandard equations we look over at dynamic programming

378
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:53,360
look over at dynamic programming problems

379
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,370


380
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:58,440
someone with me Oscar winter stack one of this recursive

381
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,170
winter stack one of this recursive relation requires for example two no

382
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,230
relation requires for example two no messages at the edges so how do I

383
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,930
messages at the edges so how do I calculate the message that x1 Stanwix to

384
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,850
calculate the message that x1 Stanwix to you I'll predict - so the idea here is

385
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,760
you I'll predict - so the idea here is the only thing you left is the potential

386
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,830
the only thing you left is the potential Taiwan - right there's no previous

387
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,830
Taiwan - right there's no previous message arriving unknown 1 and then what

388
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,170
message arriving unknown 1 and then what you need to do is to integrate on x1 and

389
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,420
you need to do is to integrate on x1 and similarly if you want to find the

390
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,890
similarly if you want to find the lessons about X capital instance

391
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,480
lessons about X capital instance basically you have to integrate X

392
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,310
basically you have to integrate X capital n from the potential Phi of xn

393
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:39,600
capital n from the potential Phi of xn plus 1 X sorry X n minus 1 extent okay

394
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,250
plus 1 X sorry X n minus 1 extent okay so similarly listening to what disappear

395
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,380
so similarly listening to what disappear so this is sort of abandoned condition

396
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,210
so this is sort of abandoned condition and another boundary condition for the

397
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,070
and another boundary condition for the North extent and then recursively you

398
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,290
North extent and then recursively you compute all the messages you compute all

399
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,770
compute all the messages you compute all the messages then you have everything

400
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,630
the messages then you have everything you have all the marginals you can do

401
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:02,690
you have all the marginals you can do anything you want all the information is

402
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:02,700


403
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,670
is inside of messages so think of this message it's right you know if some of

404
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,470
message it's right you know if some of these notes for example of evidence

405
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,100
these notes for example of evidence notes

406
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,810
notes it's basically information that

407
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,970
it's basically information that propagates from this evidence knowledge

408
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,000
propagates from this evidence knowledge to the query note that this case is X 10

409
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,040
to the query note that this case is X 10 ok and somehow what is interesting ok

410
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,290
ok and somehow what is interesting ok and you may want to think this way the

411
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,950
and you may want to think this way the marginal of its note is is this progress

412
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,170
marginal of its note is is this progress of the messages were coming right from

413
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:38,370
of the messages were coming right from the left and arrived define somehow what

414
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:42,269
the left and arrived define somehow what the status of node X 10 is okay

415
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:46,680
the status of node X 10 is okay so effectively you have belief

416
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,710
so effectively you have belief propagation if you like from x1 to xn

417
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,960
propagation if you like from x1 to xn and the neutralization of from X capital

418
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,560
and the neutralization of from X capital and physical extent and those two

419
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,529
and physical extent and those two messages define the stage of the Nordic

420
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:05,639
messages define the stage of the Nordic sent and it's Martin right you can do

421
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:09,360
sent and it's Martin right you can do actually lots of trivial calculations

422
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,289
actually lots of trivial calculations and give them as to make an e-commerce

423
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:16,440
and give them as to make an e-commerce to list mr. Arno

424
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,779
to list mr. Arno all right start writing but they put the

425
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:23,009
all right start writing but they put the next one massive calm works alright okay

426
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:25,529
next one massive calm works alright okay so here is the previa calculation and

427
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:27,539
so here is the previa calculation and let me go back suppose somebody tells

428
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:31,799
let me go back suppose somebody tells you I want to find the joint probability

429
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:35,269
you I want to find the joint probability distribution of any two arbitrary no I

430
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:38,610
distribution of any two arbitrary no I mean so don't look at the questions not

431
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,169
mean so don't look at the questions not look at the notes right the suppose you

432
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:41,669
look at the notes right the suppose you know I'll give you two nodes and I say

433
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:44,490
know I'll give you two nodes and I say find me the Joint Distribution what did

434
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,000
find me the Joint Distribution what did you do

435
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,060
you do I mean how you know just thinking of

436
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,980
I mean how you know just thinking of these messages that define the state

437
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,049
these messages that define the state that I have the joint what do you think

438
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:59,050
that I have the joint what do you think is gonna be happening

439
00:24:59,050 --> 00:24:59,060


440
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,050
you can take the notes to be next to each other far away it doesn't really

441
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,380
each other far away it doesn't really matter but if you want the joint of two

442
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,760
matter but if you want the joint of two notes what do you think it's going to be

443
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:20,380
notes what do you think it's going to be the actual result

444
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:20,390


445
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:25,539
so in this case where they sell to you is the joint of xn minus 1 an extern

446
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:29,350
is the joint of xn minus 1 an extern okay so is the nest is coming from the

447
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,310
okay so is the nest is coming from the left to xn minus 1 the mess is coming on

448
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,260
left to xn minus 1 the mess is coming on the right times the potential between

449
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:40,150
the right times the potential between the no 6 and minus 1 an example actually

450
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,539
the no 6 and minus 1 an example actually if you don't believe me that this comes

451
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:45,940
if you don't believe me that this comes in right what you need to do is start

452
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,360
in right what you need to do is start with your elimination eliminate all the

453
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,460
with your elimination eliminate all the nose to the left of xn minus 1 eliminate

454
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,680
nose to the left of xn minus 1 eliminate all the nose to the right of xn and what

455
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,950
all the nose to the right of xn and what you get the first first you will get the

456
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,510
you get the first first you will get the only thing you will not eliminate is the

457
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,330
only thing you will not eliminate is the potential between xn minus 1 and xn all

458
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,380
potential between xn minus 1 and xn all right

459
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,090
right the summation on the left will give you

460
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,260
the summation on the left will give you this mess with the rest of the right

461
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,640
this mess with the rest of the right will give you that and there is the

462
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,450
will give you that and there is the answer okay and you can do this you know

463
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:13,030
answer okay and you can do this you know if you do lots of response the things

464
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,350
if you do lots of response the things that you want to compute join these

465
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:17,500
that you want to compute join these conditions the information is encoded on

466
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,380
conditions the information is encoded on these messages via nice everything is

467
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,940
these messages via nice everything is encoded on this message this once you

468
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,900
encoded on this message this once you have these messages

469
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,210
have these messages whatever query you have if you can

470
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:30,460
whatever query you have if you can resolve it so the calculation by the way

471
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,120
resolve it so the calculation by the way to do all of this if it's variable can

472
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,539
to do all of this if it's variable can take M values in heaven and you know

473
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:44,419
take M values in heaven and you know environments so

474
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:44,429


475
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:51,049
is two times this times because you have to calculate versus coming the trouble

476
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:53,440
to calculate versus coming the trouble messages and then the backward messages

477
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,249
messages and then the backward messages the calculation of this each of the

478
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,820
the calculation of this each of the messages is basically M square in heaven

479
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,999
messages is basically M square in heaven also nm square so the cost is two times

480
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,919
also nm square so the cost is two times and M Square and the important thing

481
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:09,590
and M Square and the important thing here is linear in n and this is what

482
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:19,090
here is linear in n and this is what you're interested okay

483
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:19,100


484
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,950
any questions with this algorithm product for change obviously you can

485
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,690
product for change obviously you can imagine that this can be generalized to

486
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,970
imagine that this can be generalized to trees right so we will see how it works

487
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,669
trees right so we will see how it works with this little bit it's not tricky yes

488
00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:33,879
with this little bit it's not tricky yes the same idea more less and the notation

489
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:36,879
the same idea more less and the notation is the same but you know changed is they

490
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:40,049
is the same but you know changed is they just wait to see what's going on so now

491
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:42,639
just wait to see what's going on so now if we have evidence right how do you

492
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:45,249
if we have evidence right how do you account explicitly for the evidence and

493
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:47,769
account explicitly for the evidence and the answer to our question it it's

494
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:49,690
the answer to our question it it's actually the same way as what we have

495
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:54,759
actually the same way as what we have done is the so in this case that a you

496
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:56,649
done is the so in this case that a you want to compute not the marginal effects

497
00:27:56,649 --> 00:27:59,619
want to compute not the marginal effects 10 but let's say the conditional of

498
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:02,320
10 but let's say the conditional of extent given X capital X so let's say

499
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,330
extent given X capital X so let's say our evidence is X capital F ok so the

500
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,489
our evidence is X capital F ok so the only modification you have to do is if

501
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:12,220
only modification you have to do is if you like is in the boundary condition of

502
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,580
you like is in the boundary condition of the message about X capital n sense to

503
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,310
the message about X capital n sense to extend capital L minus 1 which is this

504
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:21,460
extend capital L minus 1 which is this message before we said is the potential

505
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,519
message before we said is the potential of xn minus 1 X 10 you remember the

506
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,159
of xn minus 1 X 10 you remember the boundary condition instead of this what

507
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:29,470
boundary condition instead of this what we have is with a summation over all

508
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,169
we have is with a summation over all possible values of X capital L now

509
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,049
possible values of X capital L now there's no summation of X capital n we

510
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:37,299
there's no summation of X capital n we fixed X capital n to whatever value we

511
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:41,470
fixed X capital n to whatever value we have digital okay so the only change in

512
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,810
have digital okay so the only change in the algorithm is instead of summing over

513
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:48,519
the algorithm is instead of summing over the values of x capital n all right you

514
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,070
the values of x capital n all right you know fixing X capital n to a specified

515
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:51,489
know fixing X capital n to a specified value

516
00:28:51,489 --> 00:28:53,830
value I mean why actually you can do is you

517
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,799
I mean why actually you can do is you can put remember our evidence potential

518
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,049
can put remember our evidence potential there you can put a delta function and

519
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:02,379
there you can put a delta function and then the channel X capital n but the

520
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:03,759
then the channel X capital n but the only value because of the Delta function

521
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:06,129
only value because of the Delta function will give you will give out and that is

522
00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:07,450
will give you will give out and that is sort of the same idea

523
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:12,549
sort of the same idea ok so you the calculations of the

524
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:14,789
ok so you the calculations of the conditional to given this evidence

525
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:16,869
conditional to given this evidence suggest be the same thing as from the

526
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:17,490
suggest be the same thing as from the Monty

527
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,520
Monty zero change in the algorithm message

528
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,500
zero change in the algorithm message come from the left and right the only

529
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,790
come from the left and right the only difference is that in the message

530
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,330
difference is that in the message propagating from the evidence here you

531
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,560
propagating from the evidence here you have to change some of the boundary

532
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:38,850
have to change some of the boundary condition with this all right I am NOT

533
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,110
condition with this all right I am NOT going to do this today

534
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,480
going to do this today all right but I want you to we're going

535
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,340
all right but I want you to we're going to spent actually a collection on this

536
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:49,200
to spent actually a collection on this algorithm but I want you to see you know

537
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,130
algorithm but I want you to see you know everything on you can actually instead

538
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,630
everything on you can actually instead of doing the summation and computing

539
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,180
of doing the summation and computing marginals somebody will tell you in this

540
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,190
marginals somebody will tell you in this chain can you find us the mold of the

541
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,500
chain can you find us the mold of the Joint Distribution in other ways can you

542
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,470
Joint Distribution in other ways can you find what is the x marks that maximizes

543
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,880
find what is the x marks that maximizes the Joint Distribution is very

544
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,390
the Joint Distribution is very high-dimensional very important problem

545
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,570
high-dimensional very important problem but I give all this volume is defined on

546
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,760
but I give all this volume is defined on the chain and you want to find the mode

547
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,560
the chain and you want to find the mode of the Joint Distribution

548
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,770
of the Joint Distribution so before we have the summation alright

549
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:26,370
so before we have the summation alright and you know and so for example in the

550
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,110
and you know and so for example in the context of the elimination algorithm

551
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,950
context of the elimination algorithm right rather than coming all the

552
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,540
right rather than coming all the different variables the way we have it

553
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,690
different variables the way we have it now what we need to do is take the

554
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,150
now what we need to do is take the factorization of the Tori and push all

555
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,250
factorization of the Tori and push all the maximizations first on X capital n

556
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,920
the maximizations first on X capital n then xn minus 1 all the way to mark

557
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,220
then xn minus 1 all the way to mark small X term so we need to find an

558
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,940
small X term so we need to find an efficient algorithm for doing this

559
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,790
efficient algorithm for doing this circle by doing calculations forwards

560
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,610
circle by doing calculations forwards and backwards and that will lead to a

561
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,710
and backwards and that will lead to a very famous dynamic programming

562
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,180
very famous dynamic programming algorithm which is that you tell the

563
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,750
algorithm which is that you tell the algorithm

564
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:06,060
algorithm ok and so we will do this for hidden

565
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,160
ok and so we will do this for hidden markov models will spend one lecture

566
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,640
markov models will spend one lecture right but I want you to see that somehow

567
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,220
right but I want you to see that somehow destination can be replaced with

568
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,810
destination can be replaced with maximization the algorithm is sort of

569
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:21,120
maximization the algorithm is sort of the same but there is some details that

570
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,270
the same but there is some details that they are unique twists

571
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:26,340
they are unique twists Bianca and they are unique because you

572
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,590
Bianca and they are unique because you know you have too much moisture the

573
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,380
know you have too much moisture the joint not the mass goes all right and

574
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,540
joint not the mass goes all right and the way you do this introduce some

575
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,700
the way you do this introduce some little treat the someone needs to

576
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,670
little treat the someone needs to consider at the end of the day so his

577
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,320
consider at the end of the day so his tongue were even worse under much

578
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,990
tongue were even worse under much product rather than some product we will

579
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:48,980
product rather than some product we will revisit okay

580
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:48,990


581
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:56,480
so the sum-product algorithm that we just discussed for change you can

582
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,600
just discussed for change you can compute a whole homogenous for trees all

583
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,690
compute a whole homogenous for trees all right and I'm gonna show you again

584
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,649
right and I'm gonna show you again pictures all right

585
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:08,990
pictures all right our undirected graph and so they are all

586
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:15,019
our undirected graph and so they are all directed graphs leading to twist vision

587
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:17,299
directed graphs leading to twist vision you know you never when we worked with

588
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:19,789
you know you never when we worked with directed graphs we have some you know

589
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:21,470
directed graphs we have some you know even in the elimination algorithm to

590
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:25,039
even in the elimination algorithm to make them undirected so when you we make

591
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,690
make them undirected so when you we make them on directly do we always get three

592
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,029
them on directly do we always get three so what do we need to get a tree in

593
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:37,510
so what do we need to get a tree in directing job

594
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:37,520


595
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:46,779
it's something to do with the moral events in life if announce that to

596
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:49,269
events in life if announce that to parents and we transform this sort of

597
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:55,419
parents and we transform this sort of directly graph what was happening we

598
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:58,539
directly graph what was happening we will get what temp and no one with two

599
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:00,880
will get what temp and no one with two powers brightening transformational

600
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,020
powers brightening transformational directive what do you get

601
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,030


602
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:11,100
if you get them out of the moralization effect you get a look so it's not a

603
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:17,010
effect you get a look so it's not a three anymore alright but if the if

604
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,299
three anymore alright but if the if every knowledge in the directed graph

605
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:21,870
every knowledge in the directed graph just one pallet then we do actually get

606
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:28,409
just one pallet then we do actually get the three okay now if in the case of a

607
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:31,710
the three okay now if in the case of a directed graph that a node would say has

608
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,100
directed graph that a node would say has two parents that you marry and you get a

609
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,850
two parents that you marry and you get a loop right you can actually transform

610
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,279
loop right you can actually transform dot on directing love to what is called

611
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,380
dot on directing love to what is called a poly-tree

612
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,409
a poly-tree and it comes out using the sponsor of

613
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:48,090
and it comes out using the sponsor of the fact of graphs that are left behind

614
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,180
the fact of graphs that are left behind from my previous lecture you can if you

615
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,770
from my previous lecture you can if you transform than the undirected graph to

616
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,840
transform than the undirected graph to what is called a factor graph then we do

617
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,950
what is called a factor graph then we do get at three my point here is that the

618
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,230
get at three my point here is that the sample that algorithm can handle all of

619
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,899
sample that algorithm can handle all of these things with the same complexity

620
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:07,649
these things with the same complexity all right so we learning on how to do

621
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:09,990
all right so we learning on how to do inference message-passing with trish is

622
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,119
inference message-passing with trish is very important because it's applied to

623
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,339
very important because it's applied to both directed and undirected graphs and

624
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:15,599
both directed and undirected graphs and we are serving the things to discuss

625
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,250
we are serving the things to discuss today with pictures okay so this is this

626
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:26,070
today with pictures okay so this is this is an undirected three okay here every

627
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,869
is an undirected three okay here every node has one part so you know this is

628
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:31,169
node has one part so you know this is this to the direct entry and if there's

629
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,970
this to the direct entry and if there's no modernization so it needs to

630
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,980
no modernization so it needs to something like that okay

631
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,250
something like that okay the only thing that i emphasized here in

632
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,770
the only thing that i emphasized here in blue is here you know in the directed

633
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,089
blue is here you know in the directed love to work with conditional

634
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:45,060
love to work with conditional distributions if we start the potentials

635
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,060
distributions if we start the potentials their conditional distributions of not

636
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,790
their conditional distributions of not given its parent and these distributions

637
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,849
given its parent and these distributions are normalized but when you work in

638
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:54,060
are normalized but when you work in undirected

639
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,070
undirected twist all right the there is a

640
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,010
twist all right the there is a normalization factor in general okay so

641
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,740
normalization factor in general okay so in general is a normalization factor

642
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,359
in general is a normalization factor even in this case if you have some

643
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,820
even in this case if you have some evidence and you can solve this sort of

644
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,840
evidence and you can solve this sort of directed tree there

645
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,550
directed tree there very speed of normalization factor the

646
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,860
very speed of normalization factor the factor we have an evidence basically

647
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:21,640
factor we have an evidence basically introduced normalization factor so

648
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:21,650


649
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:29,290
alright then here is the case of the 43 so this guy has two pilots so if you

650
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,430
so this guy has two pilots so if you marry them if you connect them together

651
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,260
marry them if you connect them together you create a loop right so this is the

652
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,230
you create a loop right so this is the 43 so we will learn I think on the

653
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,480
43 so we will learn I think on the lecture tomorrow so I don't forget we're

654
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,580
lecture tomorrow so I don't forget we're going to have election tomorrow we're

655
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,100
going to have election tomorrow we're going to extend the ideas today to see

656
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,830
going to extend the ideas today to see how we're going to do influenced only 43

657
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:51,650
how we're going to do influenced only 43 using photographs okay so we're going to

658
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,680
using photographs okay so we're going to talk about these misters passing two

659
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,380
talk about these misters passing two very general trees okay and I'm going to

660
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,150
very general trees okay and I'm going to work with what directed and undirected

661
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,630
work with what directed and undirected graphs so I need to remind you some of

662
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,720
graphs so I need to remind you some of the notation so let's the work for

663
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,000
the notation so let's the work for undirected risk and what I have here

664
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,570
undirected risk and what I have here this is the tree and I have potential

665
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,400
this is the tree and I have potential for every node and I have two pair

666
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,290
for every node and I have two pair potentials

667
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:27,320
example right this cell potentials you don't you know in general you don't need

668
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,970
don't you know in general you don't need them because the clicks here what's the

669
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:35,110
them because the clicks here what's the maximum size of the clicks here - okay

670
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,430
maximum size of the clicks here - okay but you know if you can't think right

671
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:43,250
but you know if you can't think right but this somehow was was derived by a

672
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,010
but this somehow was was derived by a directed graph then you will have the

673
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,560
directed graph then you will have the probability of the nodes and those will

674
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,100
probability of the nodes and those will correspond to this self potential or if

675
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,230
correspond to this self potential or if you can imagine if one node is

676
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,640
you can imagine if one node is prescribed this would be the evidence

677
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,670
prescribed this would be the evidence potential so it's always good in

678
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,940
potential so it's always good in addition to this pair potentials but we

679
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,790
addition to this pair potentials but we have for the tree to plug in also itself

680
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,310
have for the tree to plug in also itself attends just whatever no okay so in an

681
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,320
attends just whatever no okay so in an undirected tree this is the general

682
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,970
undirected tree this is the general expression okay this is not an

683
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,480
expression okay this is not an approximation

684
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,420
approximation of the maximal cliques your potential or

685
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,470
of the maximal cliques your potential or you note and dissolution protections now

686
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,480
you note and dissolution protections now if this was the direct entry

687
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,970
if this was the direct entry things are a little bit easier because

688
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,130
things are a little bit easier because in the direct entry what you do is you

689
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,930
in the direct entry what you do is you start with the probability of the root

690
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,270
start with the probability of the root node and then you have the probability

691
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,420
node and then you have the probability of the notes given the product okay

692
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,859
of the notes given the product okay so actively if you want to take a direct

693
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:39,510
so actively if you want to take a direct entry and transform into an undirected

694
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,339
entry and transform into an undirected you can see the one-to-one

695
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:43,339
you can see the one-to-one correspondence between this

696
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:46,050
correspondence between this probabilities in this pair potentials

697
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,020
probabilities in this pair potentials and easily you can make this to

698
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,750
and easily you can make this to correspond to that how is that you know

699
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,839
correspond to that how is that you know you can say at the node are make this

700
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,630
you can say at the node are make this potential kayak sorry for the P of X

701
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,790
potential kayak sorry for the P of X star and make all the other potential

702
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:04,380
star and make all the other potential equal to one okay so so basically this

703
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,050
equal to one okay so so basically this is a very general expression for both

704
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:13,630
is a very general expression for both directed and undirected rich

705
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:13,640


706
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:19,630
evidence we basically the other thing you have to do if let's say the value of

707
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,170
you have to do if let's say the value of x is fixed at X I bar you need to change

708
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,180
x is fixed at X I bar you need to change the definition of the step potentials

709
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:30,400
the definition of the step potentials and so the note is not evidence now this

710
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,980
and so the note is not evidence now this potential is what you started with in

711
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,319
potential is what you started with in evidence no if you just have to plug in

712
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:37,120
evidence no if you just have to plug in this Delta function that basically says

713
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,050
this Delta function that basically says the value of this X I you will get a

714
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,059
the value of this X I you will get a nonzero contribution where X is equal to

715
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:48,069
nonzero contribution where X is equal to X I bar so if you have evidence the

716
00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:49,900
X I bar so if you have evidence the previous equation that they had this is

717
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,020
previous equation that they had this is you know the joint now if I want to

718
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,589
you know the joint now if I want to write the probability of x given the

719
00:38:56,589 --> 00:39:00,460
write the probability of x given the evidence the expression is the same this

720
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,660
evidence the expression is the same this are the self potentials for each node

721
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,730
are the self potentials for each node but there are the evidence potentials

722
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,950
but there are the evidence potentials this multiplied potential but what is

723
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,930
this multiplied potential but what is important note is when you have evidence

724
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,109
important note is when you have evidence the normalization factor now may not be

725
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:17,020
the normalization factor now may not be one so even if this graph was derived

726
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,510
one so even if this graph was derived from the directed graph where everything

727
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,660
from the directed graph where everything is normalized so you notice in this case

728
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,000
is normalized so you notice in this case when we talk about the ref to trace this

729
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,640
when we talk about the ref to trace this are normalized probability is equal to 1

730
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,050
are normalized probability is equal to 1 but when you have evidence the

731
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:34,210
but when you have evidence the normalization factor is not one so in

732
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:37,000
normalization factor is not one so in some cases in problems with evidence it

733
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,740
some cases in problems with evidence it doesn't really matter it kept directed

734
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,540
doesn't really matter it kept directed or undirected because the degree of

735
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,630
or undirected because the degree of complexity is the same just remember

736
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,400
complexity is the same just remember that this normalization factor is not

737
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,550
that this normalization factor is not one okay

738
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:50,560


739
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,579
[Applause] don't need this

740
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:55,589


741
00:39:55,589 --> 00:40:01,759
we don't need this all right so let me remind you before I start the algorithm

742
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:05,689
remind you before I start the algorithm of somewhere so prefer not the synthetic

743
00:40:05,689 --> 00:40:07,519
of somewhere so prefer not the synthetic things but sort of formal sense things

744
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:09,620
things but sort of formal sense things that usually you don't see when you

745
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,130
that usually you don't see when you program this directory

746
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,709
program this directory suppose that the actual potentials right

747
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:18,920
suppose that the actual potentials right we're coming from a directed tree and

748
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,140
we're coming from a directed tree and indirectly created the traditions we

749
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,709
indirectly created the traditions we work with are the probability of XJ

750
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:26,719
work with are the probability of XJ given its pilot so let's say the part

751
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:29,029
given its pilot so let's say the part here this run parent versus three its

752
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:31,939
here this run parent versus three its sixth I suppose now we start we have a

753
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:34,189
sixth I suppose now we start we have a query log here and we start eliminating

754
00:40:34,189 --> 00:40:36,650
query log here and we start eliminating node from the bottom except from the

755
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:40,069
node from the bottom except from the league's new you may have made that if I

756
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:43,849
league's new you may have made that if I start coming or node XJ serving an 18 X

757
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:48,109
start coming or node XJ serving an 18 X a but this will come equal to 1 right

758
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:50,660
a but this will come equal to 1 right six days we are interested here and we

759
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,609
six days we are interested here and we scientifically the flex a it will

760
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:54,229
scientifically the flex a it will disappear because it is equal to one

761
00:40:54,229 --> 00:41:04,489
disappear because it is equal to one okay alright so in assuming that you

762
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:05,900
okay alright so in assuming that you have no evidence in this unconditional

763
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,709
have no evidence in this unconditional case you are instincts solve that this

764
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:12,439
case you are instincts solve that this note that there is no evidence basically

765
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:15,169
note that there is no evidence basically you can eliminate them before you reach

766
00:41:15,169 --> 00:41:17,749
you can eliminate them before you reach your query no you know what that means

767
00:41:17,749 --> 00:41:19,819
your query no you know what that means test if I am interested in what is going

768
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:22,519
test if I am interested in what is going on here and I have a lot of knowledge

769
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:24,199
on here and I have a lot of knowledge with not only does not here what can I

770
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:28,279
with not only does not here what can I do to those now if you're interested to

771
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:29,959
do to those now if you're interested to figure out the probability of this node

772
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:32,419
figure out the probability of this node in the best together they have a lots of

773
00:41:32,419 --> 00:41:34,489
in the best together they have a lots of laws below that they are not evidence

774
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:37,130
laws below that they are not evidence now what can I increase for good was now

775
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:43,190
now what can I increase for good was now considering that this is the case

776
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:43,200


777
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,650
we can prove them we can get rid of them because they will not contribute

778
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:50,339
because they will not contribute anything and you know what that means

779
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,920
anything and you know what that means that is actually if I'm interested in

780
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,950
that is actually if I'm interested in what is going on here and down here at

781
00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:00,180
what is going on here and down here at abilities right in the ordering of

782
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,839
abilities right in the ordering of contamination in the only make sense to

783
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,280
contamination in the only make sense to assume that the leaves have what I could

784
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,460
assume that the leaves have what I could know here if the nodes are not

785
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,440
know here if the nodes are not unspecified are not part of the evidence

786
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,020
unspecified are not part of the evidence will disappear will be cleaned out so

787
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,420
will disappear will be cleaned out so the only thing we need to consider is

788
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,809
the only thing we need to consider is when we know the leaves are what what I

789
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:26,339
when we know the leaves are what what I was not evident okay so we only have to

790
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:30,089
was not evident okay so we only have to consider the case where the the lists

791
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,640
consider the case where the the lists are basically evidence okay in that case

792
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,099
are basically evidence okay in that case remember that normalizations g that we

793
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:36,990
remember that normalizations g that we consider it don't want to be equal to

794
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,890
consider it don't want to be equal to one so we can prove any subtree that

795
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,510
one so we can prove any subtree that contention developers that are not

796
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:45,059
contention developers that are not conditioned on by eliminating backwards

797
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:50,819
conditioned on by eliminating backwards okay so so let's see now what happens

798
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:53,250
okay so so let's see now what happens okay

799
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:58,559
okay in a case like this I am claiming if

800
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:00,930
in a case like this I am claiming if this is my evidence node but somehow

801
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:03,599
this is my evidence node but somehow this traced I can prove them and I can

802
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,300
this traced I can prove them and I can do inference on incident support Li so I

803
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,710
do inference on incident support Li so I want you to tell me why it's not the

804
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:12,630
want you to tell me why it's not the case

805
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:12,640


806
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,959
you don't have to read what it says there because I don't have time for

807
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:19,259
there because I don't have time for reading right so just this is my only

808
00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:23,370
reading right so just this is my only evidence right here I'm not implying

809
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:27,329
evidence right here I'm not implying that you're not going to account for the

810
00:43:27,329 --> 00:43:29,999
that you're not going to account for the changes let's say the potentials because

811
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:34,459
changes let's say the potentials because of the evidence but why I can actually

812
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:37,410
of the evidence but why I can actually separate this to three traced work in

813
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:39,989
separate this to three traced work in doing front separately what is they are

814
00:43:39,989 --> 00:43:41,880
doing front separately what is they are fundamental this graph that allows me to

815
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:48,190
fundamental this graph that allows me to do that

816
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:48,200


817
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:54,030
for example with this evident evidence here what can you tell me on the

818
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:59,230
here what can you tell me on the probability of this note conditioned on

819
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,339
probability of this note conditioned on on the list

820
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:02,440
on the list I mean conditioned on the app noticed

821
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,059
I mean conditioned on the app noticed what can you tell me about the joint

822
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:06,039
what can you tell me about the joint probability let's say of this and this

823
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:10,650
probability let's say of this and this condition of that they are independent

824
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:17,530
condition of that they are independent okay so effectively the only thing we

825
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,839
okay so effectively the only thing we really have to consider is anything that

826
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,700
really have to consider is anything that we have observed right you prune it away

827
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,849
we have observed right you prune it away all right and the only notes that you're

828
00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:26,650
all right and the only notes that you're going to have to believe we have to be

829
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,510
going to have to believe we have to be evidence leaves and everything else

830
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,799
evidence leaves and everything else basically has to be on themselves that

831
00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:32,910
basically has to be on themselves that will be interesting to do inference okay

832
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:35,319
will be interesting to do inference okay so there is lots of things that I said

833
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:38,020
so there is lots of things that I said there but some of them basically are

834
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,809
there but some of them basically are sort of common strands coming in the

835
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:42,460
sort of common strands coming in the context of the direct draft from this

836
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,410
context of the direct draft from this relation there is no point of doing

837
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,240
relation there is no point of doing stations that they are equal to answer

838
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,000
stations that they are equal to answer what you need to do is prune leaves that

839
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,930
what you need to do is prune leaves that are basically unobserved and if you have

840
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,549
are basically unobserved and if you have evidence you have to be careful to know

841
00:44:54,549 --> 00:44:56,859
evidence you have to be careful to know because evidence splits the graph and

842
00:44:56,859 --> 00:44:59,020
because evidence splits the graph and then you may be able to have inference

843
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,870
then you may be able to have inference in like this case with three different

844
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:07,750
in like this case with three different graphs so we're going to stop doing

845
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:11,049
graphs so we're going to stop doing message passing on twist and generalize

846
00:45:11,049 --> 00:45:15,870
message passing on twist and generalize the the algorithm we saw on on a chain

847
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:20,170
the the algorithm we saw on on a chain so this now would be on the tree the

848
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,260
so this now would be on the tree the same any are criticized know which the

849
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:28,569
same any are criticized know which the first order elimination

850
00:45:28,569 --> 00:45:28,579


851
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:32,150
we're gonna have to do some elimination of the notes right then one way or

852
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:37,999
of the notes right then one way or another it's a tree I'm going to give

853
00:45:37,999 --> 00:45:40,160
another it's a tree I'm going to give you an algorithm is the lecture today

854
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,489
you an algorithm is the lecture today and that defines first-order but in this

855
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:48,709
and that defines first-order but in this case the first order is you start

856
00:45:48,709 --> 00:45:51,799
case the first order is you start basically from the left subtree which is

857
00:45:51,799 --> 00:45:55,699
basically from the left subtree which is this and you start from the left to the

858
00:45:55,699 --> 00:45:59,469
this and you start from the left to the right of 4 5 2 3 and 1

859
00:45:59,469 --> 00:46:02,929
right of 4 5 2 3 and 1 ok so obviously in every sub 3 you have

860
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:04,370
ok so obviously in every sub 3 you have to start from the child's but always

861
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:09,880
to start from the child's but always from the left so for 5 to 3 anyone ok I

862
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,169
from the left so for 5 to 3 anyone ok I gave here that's gonna stack you want to

863
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,969
gave here that's gonna stack you want to click it but I'm going to give you the

864
00:46:13,969 --> 00:46:16,160
click it but I'm going to give you the algorithm and all of this algorithms

865
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,689
algorithm and all of this algorithms that you would see on Three's they're

866
00:46:17,689 --> 00:46:19,910
that you would see on Three's they're already cursing so I don't know if you

867
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,559
already cursing so I don't know if you ever programmed anything with recursive

868
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:24,289
ever programmed anything with recursive algorithms but sort of you need to get

869
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:27,890
algorithms but sort of you need to get used to when you do sort of message

870
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:34,699
used to when you do sort of message passing algorithm okay so let me we have

871
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:39,079
passing algorithm okay so let me we have a first order elimination and I'm gonna

872
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:42,229
a first order elimination and I'm gonna give you a message passing version of

873
00:46:42,229 --> 00:46:43,819
give you a message passing version of the elimination algorithm so let's say

874
00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:46,249
the elimination algorithm so let's say let's say that we're interested we have

875
00:46:46,249 --> 00:46:48,819
let's say that we're interested we have evidence of now such 2 and X 4 and X 5

876
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:52,849
evidence of now such 2 and X 4 and X 5 right and somebody tells you compute the

877
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:55,849
right and somebody tells you compute the conditional of X 3 okay so basically

878
00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:58,449
conditional of X 3 okay so basically what we need to do is we need to

879
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:01,459
what we need to do is we need to integrate X 1 here all right so let's

880
00:47:01,459 --> 00:47:07,209
integrate X 1 here all right so let's say the factorization theorist myself

881
00:47:07,209 --> 00:47:10,249
say the factorization theorist myself you know certain all potentials which

882
00:47:10,249 --> 00:47:12,499
you know certain all potentials which are based at least evidence modify

883
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:14,150
are based at least evidence modify deafness potentials be introduced before

884
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:17,599
deafness potentials be introduced before this playoffs xixj because my colleagues

885
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,640
this playoffs xixj because my colleagues have maximum size is 2 so I am writing

886
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,960
have maximum size is 2 so I am writing least an undirected graph so I have

887
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,830
least an undirected graph so I have pretentious for Salford Xie for sexual

888
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,740
pretentious for Salford Xie for sexual onyx to explore its 385 but and I have

889
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,670
onyx to explore its 385 but and I have the potential 6 1 X 2 X 1 X 3 X 3 X 4

890
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:40,109
the potential 6 1 X 2 X 1 X 3 X 3 X 4 and X 3 X 5 so what I have done here is

891
00:47:40,109 --> 00:47:44,890
and X 3 X 5 so what I have done here is X 2 X 4 X 5 are given right I don't need

892
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,450
X 2 X 4 X 5 are given right I don't need to do any modifications the only

893
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,820
to do any modifications the only modifications are inside the definition

894
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,060
modifications are inside the definition of this tie a right so there's no need

895
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:55,120
of this tie a right so there's no need to sound 1 X 2 X 4 X 5 with a delta

896
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,280
to sound 1 X 2 X 4 X 5 with a delta function because this is already done

897
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,740
function because this is already done inside sorry so the only thing I have

898
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:03,010
inside sorry so the only thing I have here is estimation of next month all

899
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:06,099
here is estimation of next month all right estimation electron but below the

900
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:08,500
right estimation electron but below the summation you see some definitions that

901
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,830
summation you see some definitions that I want you to look carefully on what is

902
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:17,220
I want you to look carefully on what is definitions imply in the context of

903
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,770
definitions imply in the context of eliminating Note one at a time so let's

904
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:26,320
eliminating Note one at a time so let's look at this last term okay so when

905
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,330
look at this last term okay so when interested you remember the conditional

906
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:31,690
interested you remember the conditional of X 3 given this evidence okay so the

907
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,720
of X 3 given this evidence okay so the last term I see changed the cell

908
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,720
last term I see changed the cell potential of X 5 right and then the

909
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:42,359
potential of X 5 right and then the potential effects we are expired okay

910
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:42,369


911
00:48:42,369 --> 00:48:50,320
now the reason there is no solution or expired here is worth again valve is the

912
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:55,859
expired here is worth again valve is the summation of X 5 because turning it okay

913
00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:58,089
summation of X 5 because turning it okay there is another function that will try

914
00:48:58,089 --> 00:49:02,040
there is another function that will try SEC strive to be expired are there okay

915
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,630
SEC strive to be expired are there okay again if you want to put explicitly with

916
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,460
again if you want to put explicitly with a delta function there it will take care

917
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,670
a delta function there it will take care of it but you know alright so can you

918
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:11,859
of it but you know alright so can you tell me just basically what is this

919
00:49:11,859 --> 00:49:16,359
tell me just basically what is this product you think doing for us is try of

920
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:20,140
product you think doing for us is try of X 5 times I of X 5 4 X 3 okay I always

921
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,620
X 5 times I of X 5 4 X 3 okay I always really noted this and with substrate 5 3

922
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,290
really noted this and with substrate 5 3 and it's a function of X 3 because X 5

923
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:29,470
and it's a function of X 3 because X 5 is just the cost so what is that

924
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:32,530
is just the cost so what is that if we are going to put some words to

925
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:36,670
if we are going to put some words to define it what is that sign here fix

926
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:38,950
define it what is that sign here fix five times the potential of X 3 X 5 what

927
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:43,870
five times the potential of X 3 X 5 what is up I mean obviously M stands for

928
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:50,160
is up I mean obviously M stands for message so what is that

929
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:50,170


930
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:58,650
is the message x5 1033 okay and this one you know what this is it is evidence

931
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:00,930
you know what this is it is evidence propagation from below to know the

932
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:05,420
propagation from below to know the extreme the fact that xx5 has some value

933
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:08,310
extreme the fact that xx5 has some value interesting thing for x3 and other

934
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:12,320
interesting thing for x3 and other implications contained from this message

935
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:12,330


936
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:19,770
so it is ready you know belief propagation okay and similarly the

937
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:23,040
propagation okay and similarly the second term side effects four times the

938
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,470
second term side effects four times the joint of experienced four is this

939
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:28,350
joint of experienced four is this message from four to three okay so this

940
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:31,830
message from four to three okay so this is message passing from X 4 X 3 so

941
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:35,190
is message passing from X 4 X 3 so evidence probe x4 propagates to three

942
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:38,640
evidence probe x4 propagates to three similarly the message from x3 to x1

943
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,920
similarly the message from x3 to x1 which is lit alright so we're rewriting

944
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,960
which is lit alright so we're rewriting this equation now this there's no

945
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,880
this equation now this there's no summation X 3 so this goes outside and

946
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,880
summation X 3 so this goes outside and the installation on x1 distance depend

947
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,830
the installation on x1 distance depend only on x2 ratio I don't touch them and

948
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:55,620
only on x2 ratio I don't touch them and there is destination x1 so let's look at

949
00:50:55,620 --> 00:51:00,150
there is destination x1 so let's look at this list very carefully it says take

950
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:03,600
this list very carefully it says take the evidence on so we have two stomachs

951
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:08,340
the evidence on so we have two stomachs one ok so take the evidence of node X 1

952
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,910
one ok so take the evidence of node X 1 all right take the potential of x1 x3

953
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:16,050
all right take the potential of x1 x3 and take the message that is propagated

954
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:19,350
and take the message that is propagated virtual from node 2 and then get rid of

955
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:23,640
virtual from node 2 and then get rid of X 1 so I wish you'd remember when we

956
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,240
X 1 so I wish you'd remember when we discuss about change and and we have the

957
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,130
discuss about change and and we have the recasting this form of our relations and

958
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,830
recasting this form of our relations and result the Masters this way it is the

959
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:33,930
result the Masters this way it is the potential times the messes coming in and

960
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,850
potential times the messes coming in and then go integrate the previous variables

961
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:39,450
then go integrate the previous variables out so look at this it stays here if I

962
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:44,630
out so look at this it stays here if I call this m13 the testament 3 is the

963
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:47,970
call this m13 the testament 3 is the potential of x1 and the potential X 1 X

964
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:51,240
potential of x1 and the potential X 1 X 2 times the mess is coming from node 2

965
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,350
2 times the mess is coming from node 2 and then integrating note you are the

966
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:57,370
and then integrating note you are the only thing that is actually

967
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:59,859
only thing that is actually from what we had before is but now we

968
00:51:59,859 --> 00:52:02,229
from what we had before is but now we have included itself potential nodes

969
00:52:02,229 --> 00:52:05,410
have included itself potential nodes that need to carry them all right but if

970
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,029
that need to carry them all right but if whatever reason you wanted you could

971
00:52:07,029 --> 00:52:09,549
whatever reason you wanted you could have integrate those inside aspera

972
00:52:09,549 --> 00:52:11,650
have integrate those inside aspera potentials as well so the equation would

973
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:15,339
potentials as well so the equation would look identical but again the recursive

974
00:52:15,339 --> 00:52:16,960
look identical but again the recursive equation says she's too tough to find

975
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,799
equation says she's too tough to find them 1/3 which the function of X 3

976
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:23,049
them 1/3 which the function of X 3 integrate electron the cell potential of

977
00:52:23,049 --> 00:52:25,719
integrate electron the cell potential of this node the joint potential of X 1 X 2

978
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:28,079
this node the joint potential of X 1 X 2 and the message arrived in a node X bar

979
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,420
and the message arrived in a node X bar so the master sub base can propagate it

980
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,579
so the master sub base can propagate it is the message coming in times these

981
00:52:33,579 --> 00:52:39,370
is the message coming in times these potentials with actual eliminate make

982
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:46,370
potentials with actual eliminate make strange sense a little bit

983
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:46,380


984
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:50,210
and again in case you know what if you look at the equation the question of

985
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:55,730
look at the equation the question of total power looks you know not

986
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:58,730
total power looks you know not complicated but you know if you get a

987
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:00,590
complicated but you know if you get a much better sense if you look at the

988
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:03,830
much better sense if you look at the graph right and you say look information

989
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:06,500
graph right and you say look information propagates from the evidence to know x3

990
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,260
propagates from the evidence to know x3 but the information to propagate it has

991
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,290
but the information to propagate it has to first go to node X 1 how does it do

992
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:13,250
to first go to node X 1 how does it do this with this message

993
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,060
this with this message M 2 1 okay which is this and then

994
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,250
M 2 1 okay which is this and then information has to go from node X 1 to

995
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:23,060
information has to go from node X 1 to node X 3 and this is the lastest and 1/3

996
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:25,640
node X 3 and this is the lastest and 1/3 how do you get them or 3 is by

997
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,890
how do you get them or 3 is by eliminating X 1 and how do you eliminate

998
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:30,830
eliminating X 1 and how do you eliminate X 1 you multiply the potential first one

999
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:33,140
X 1 you multiply the potential first one the joint returns to X 1 X 2 and then

1000
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,050
the joint returns to X 1 X 2 and then coming message because all the messages

1001
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:39,710
coming message because all the messages from the evidence need to be propagated

1002
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:42,530
from the evidence need to be propagated through right and so together 1 3 you

1003
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:46,000
through right and so together 1 3 you have to compute M 2 1 which also implies

1004
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,020
have to compute M 2 1 which also implies that this calculation of messages has to

1005
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,270
that this calculation of messages has to be done in the order of elimination of

1006
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:55,940
be done in the order of elimination of no you cannot grow another Gration

1007
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,350
no you cannot grow another Gration calculate M 1 3 before calculating M 2 1

1008
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:01,340
calculate M 1 3 before calculating M 2 1 because you will not have enough

1009
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,740
because you will not have enough information to do the calculation okay

1010
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,860
information to do the calculation okay however I can tell too late the message

1011
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,870
however I can tell too late the message from X 1 to X 3 at the same time as I

1012
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:12,950
from X 1 to X 3 at the same time as I calculate the messages from 2 to 1 so

1013
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:15,140
calculate the messages from 2 to 1 so actually you can do all of this in

1014
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,900
actually you can do all of this in parallel right but you need to basically

1015
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,330
parallel right but you need to basically have a scheme that says you can only

1016
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:22,010
have a scheme that says you can only propagate if you can only calculate the

1017
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:24,410
propagate if you can only calculate the message will not have to know so you can

1018
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,300
message will not have to know so you can propagate let's say a message from road

1019
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,840
propagate let's say a message from road 1 2 3 all the whole incoming messages to

1020
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,370
1 2 3 all the whole incoming messages to node 1 are already there

1021
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:33,800
node 1 are already there this is like doing power programming

1022
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,450
this is like doing power programming right then you say you know if you

1023
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:38,090
right then you say you know if you noticed executing and sending

1024
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:40,160
noticed executing and sending information somewhere else if all the

1025
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:40,740
information somewhere else if all the information

1026
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:49,440
ship has arrived in that information here is this incoming messages okay all

1027
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,390
here is this incoming messages okay all right so anything our language now

1028
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,440
right so anything our language now practically identical to what we

1029
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,270
practically identical to what we discussed off twist and what we

1030
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:00,930
discussed off twist and what we described the last five minutes so let

1031
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,810
described the last five minutes so let me define so if you know here is all of

1032
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:05,040
me define so if you know here is all of us have cell phones actually I don't

1033
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,170
us have cell phones actually I don't know why they should look here like

1034
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:11,580
know why they should look here like ellipsis but so of this unknown okay so

1035
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,140
ellipsis but so of this unknown okay so let's say that this is something up

1036
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,450
let's say that this is something up there the root node this is no block aye

1037
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:20,550
there the root node this is no block aye and this is J and we want to compute the

1038
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,600
and this is J and we want to compute the message a sense to know died

1039
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,060
message a sense to know died so the message Jason still alive again

1040
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,310
so the message Jason still alive again don't look at the equations right it

1041
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:32,720
don't look at the equations right it would be the cell potential of non-jury

1042
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,730
would be the cell potential of non-jury right the joint potential of

1043
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:38,790
right the joint potential of neuroscience a and the product of all

1044
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,460
neuroscience a and the product of all the messages arriving today from all of

1045
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:47,130
the messages arriving today from all of these neighbors except no die so are all

1046
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,840
these neighbors except no die so are all the message to the right from below and

1047
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,140
the message to the right from below and then gusano J or which means we

1048
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:58,200
then gusano J or which means we eliminate a okay so summation J of the

1049
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,900
eliminate a okay so summation J of the cell potential of XJ the joint potential

1050
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,440
cell potential of XJ the joint potential clients a and all the messages arriving

1051
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,650
clients a and all the messages arriving at node J from below from all of its

1052
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:10,950
at node J from below from all of its neighbors except our you're not gonna

1053
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,620
neighbors except our you're not gonna stand to use to no die a message you

1054
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:17,040
stand to use to no die a message you received a line and actually that's a

1055
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,440
received a line and actually that's a very philosophical statement and if

1056
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,730
very philosophical statement and if you're interested can give you

1057
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:24,750
you're interested can give you information to read about it alright so

1058
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,460
information to read about it alright so in other ways you know if you don't you

1059
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:28,470
in other ways you know if you don't you know you may like to make yourself feel

1060
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:30,990
know you may like to make yourself feel good and send messages to yourself but

1061
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:35,300
good and send messages to yourself but that actually it your problem

1062
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:43,150
that actually it your problem letter problem okay

1063
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:43,160


1064
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:49,090
let's not kill ossifies because that's nothing with territory to be okay any

1065
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:53,110
nothing with territory to be okay any question some of this is actually the

1066
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,030
question some of this is actually the Iowa does can you tell me what's the

1067
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:57,040
Iowa does can you tell me what's the difference of the difference from the

1068
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,930
difference of the difference from the chain algorithm that we saw before right

1069
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:01,720
chain algorithm that we saw before right just one big chain so look at this and

1070
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,130
just one big chain so look at this and tell me what is different from before

1071
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:09,300
tell me what is different from before every single term that looks different

1072
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:09,310


1073
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:18,400
what is different here for example in a chain what was it a little product what

1074
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,270
chain what was it a little product what did we have if you have a chain this one

1075
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:25,060
did we have if you have a chain this one no the northern or another node so how

1076
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,250
no the northern or another node so how many neighbors except I do we have work

1077
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:33,520
many neighbors except I do we have work for the nodes a so here there is only

1078
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:39,880
for the nodes a so here there is only one the incoming method alright and what

1079
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,100
one the incoming method alright and what we do not have explicitly right and you

1080
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,940
we do not have explicitly right and you know again it makes no difference we do

1081
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:50,800
know again it makes no difference we do not have this step potential that is

1082
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,350
not have this step potential that is listen to incorporate basically evidence

1083
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:56,410
listen to incorporate basically evidence okay so this was already there this was

1084
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:59,320
okay so this was already there this was only one term and elimination of XJ this

1085
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,150
only one term and elimination of XJ this relationship that's the message they

1086
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:08,070
relationship that's the message they send out okay so if you want to compute

1087
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:10,420
send out okay so if you want to compute so many do these calculations that say

1088
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,870
so many do these calculations that say your interest to go on and find the

1089
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:15,190
your interest to go on and find the conditional of the root node given the

1090
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:21,760
conditional of the root node given the evidence in this case okay so let me

1091
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,760
evidence in this case okay so let me because I see the calculation here

1092
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,170
because I see the calculation here remind me when we wanted to find the

1093
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,000
remind me when we wanted to find the marginal offending knowledge what did we

1094
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,230
marginal offending knowledge what did we do on the chain when we want to find the

1095
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:35,650
do on the chain when we want to find the marginal of any No

1096
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:35,660


1097
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,440
the in the saying you know there was left and right to have the knowledge so

1098
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,450
left and right to have the knowledge so what do we do

1099
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,620
what do we do we took the Masters character of the

1100
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,450
we took the Masters character of the left the mess is coming from the right

1101
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:44,890
left the mess is coming from the right in general our taste will be whatever

1102
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:47,200
in general our taste will be whatever the Masters are coming if we multiply we

1103
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,269
the Masters are coming if we multiply we get them the marginal now I try to look

1104
00:58:49,269 --> 00:58:52,359
get them the marginal now I try to look at the roof no don't leave any messages

1105
00:58:52,359 --> 00:58:55,809
at the roof no don't leave any messages coming from above good note so the

1106
00:58:55,809 --> 00:58:58,660
coming from above good note so the message is coming from from below so

1107
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,479
message is coming from from below so basically what you have is all the

1108
00:59:01,479 --> 00:59:03,430
basically what you have is all the message is coming to the root node from

1109
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:06,460
message is coming to the root node from its neighbors from below times obviously

1110
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,450
its neighbors from below times obviously I have to put the search potential of

1111
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:13,420
I have to put the search potential of the root node okay if it is not one and

1112
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,609
the root node okay if it is not one and then if you want you to normalize this

1113
00:59:15,609 --> 00:59:18,359
then if you want you to normalize this the way you share the denominator

1114
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:21,430
the way you share the denominator obviously this equation will apply to

1115
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,880
obviously this equation will apply to any node which if you want to find the

1116
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,920
any node which if you want to find the marginal of no ties you take the

1117
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,660
marginal of no ties you take the products of all of the messages coming

1118
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:33,400
products of all of the messages coming up now die from below all right and then

1119
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,930
up now die from below all right and then just normalize here and you can get the

1120
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:38,190
just normalize here and you can get the conditional of node I given the evidence

1121
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:40,839
conditional of node I given the evidence and actually no that's the table

1122
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:45,579
and actually no that's the table question okay well say sphere your

1123
00:59:45,579 --> 00:59:47,410
question okay well say sphere your similar equations to find the marginal

1124
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:52,930
similar equations to find the marginal at every node okay now the bottom line

1125
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:55,539
at every node okay now the bottom line and maybe as we have put this with red

1126
00:59:55,539 --> 00:59:57,430
and maybe as we have put this with red letters or something coloring there is

1127
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:59,650
letters or something coloring there is about this now weighs it scales linearly

1128
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:03,940
about this now weighs it scales linearly with the size of of the tree this is

1129
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,479
with the size of of the tree this is basically the best you can do all right

1130
01:00:06,479 --> 01:00:12,190
basically the best you can do all right dunya cost Rafi okay and all the

1131
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:15,009
dunya cost Rafi okay and all the equations are exactly as no there's no

1132
01:00:15,009 --> 01:00:21,069
equations are exactly as no there's no approximation okay so we need to do

1133
01:00:21,069 --> 01:00:22,920
approximation okay so we need to do actually we finished today doing

1134
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,749
actually we finished today doing different examples because they look

1135
01:00:25,749 --> 01:00:28,690
different examples because they look trivial now you should've told me that

1136
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:30,819
trivial now you should've told me that in the homework some of you arrived on

1137
01:00:30,819 --> 01:00:32,620
in the homework some of you arrived on doing calculations some calculations by

1138
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:35,890
doing calculations some calculations by can you not living problems some of you

1139
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:38,210
can you not living problems some of you were all down

1140
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:40,160
were all down some of this and that should be the

1141
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,430
some of this and that should be the answer right the last one option is not

1142
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:45,980
answer right the last one option is not a good one we have tried the lighted by

1143
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,630
a good one we have tried the lighted by Chen to do all the calculations or

1144
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:50,150
Chen to do all the calculations or actually write a computer program to do

1145
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,780
actually write a computer program to do this but don't say what you know what

1146
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:55,760
this but don't say what you know what you multiply first and even your sound

1147
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,530
you multiply first and even your sound and whatever comes out to be the answer

1148
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:59,630
and whatever comes out to be the answer that doesn't help

1149
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:03,770
that doesn't help right if I understood correctly okay

1150
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:07,250
right if I understood correctly okay something like that so let's take a

1151
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:12,470
something like that so let's take a simple case we are interested here to

1152
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:15,140
simple case we are interested here to complete the marginals in this temple

1153
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:20,570
complete the marginals in this temple tree so obviously we're going to have

1154
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:24,410
tree so obviously we're going to have some post positive elimination here and

1155
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,750
some post positive elimination here and this place will be this node and this

1156
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:27,770
this place will be this node and this and this and that

1157
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:29,630
and this and that okay so we're gonna start sending

1158
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:33,589
okay so we're gonna start sending messages from the leaves all the way up

1159
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:36,200
messages from the leaves all the way up to the root so I can send this messes up

1160
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,800
to the root so I can send this messes up in this message simultaneously and once

1161
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,599
in this message simultaneously and once know the tree has received this two

1162
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,190
know the tree has received this two messages then I can send the message to

1163
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:47,060
messages then I can send the message to the top two o'clock we should have right

1164
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:49,910
the top two o'clock we should have right so we didn't do this all up the same

1165
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:51,740
so we didn't do this all up the same step right here send one message to this

1166
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:54,770
step right here send one message to this together then you can send the messages

1167
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:56,780
together then you can send the messages once you have that you can turn the

1168
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:01,130
once you have that you can turn the message to no one once node one has

1169
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,720
message to no one once node one has received this message then can send them

1170
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:07,930
received this message then can send them a message back you know - all right so

1171
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:11,300
a message back you know - all right so so node 1 sends a message a 1 2 2 2 and

1172
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:15,650
so node 1 sends a message a 1 2 2 2 and then you are ready to do what now is

1173
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:17,420
then you are ready to do what now is this now ready to send the message to

1174
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:20,450
this now ready to send the message to North Korea would be we need to send a

1175
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:24,930
North Korea would be we need to send a message from 2 to 3

1176
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:24,940


1177
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:29,970
you need to know all the incoming message which is this and this which you

1178
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:32,010
message which is this and this which you calculate it so then you can send the

1179
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:36,060
calculate it so then you can send the message to you know from two to three

1180
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:39,840
message to you know from two to three which is this message here and then what

1181
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,480
which is this message here and then what we need to send the message before if

1182
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,670
we need to send the message before if you need this and you need that so if

1183
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:46,110
you need this and you need that so if you can send the message to the fourth

1184
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:49,650
you can send the message to the fourth so effectively actually once did you get

1185
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:52,110
so effectively actually once did you get this message here you can turn off any

1186
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:53,910
this message here you can turn off any stunts all sending messages to walk

1187
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:55,830
stunts all sending messages to walk through all three and no it's for as you

1188
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:57,000
through all three and no it's for as you see here okay

1189
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,910
see here okay once these messes are completed you can

1190
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:02,760
once these messes are completed you can go and calculate anything you want the

1191
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,580
go and calculate anything you want the marginals you can normalize conditionals

1192
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,980
marginals you can normalize conditionals you can put evidence you can do anything

1193
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,560
you can put evidence you can do anything you want okay now obviously when you

1194
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,650
you want okay now obviously when you program there is the tricky part is to

1195
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:17,190
program there is the tricky part is to be able to compute messages not just one

1196
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:19,200
be able to compute messages not just one after the other but you have some

1197
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,780
after the other but you have some algorithm that says you know what I can

1198
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:23,910
algorithm that says you know what I can compute this by simultaneously then once

1199
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:25,350
compute this by simultaneously then once you have all this message here I can

1200
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:28,380
you have all this message here I can compute the outgoing message etc etc so

1201
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:33,480
compute the outgoing message etc etc so you need to have some way to figure out

1202
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,030
you need to have some way to figure out when a node is ready to send messages to

1203
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:41,070
when a node is ready to send messages to its neighbors all right is this two

1204
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:44,250
its neighbors all right is this two different different okay so in this

1205
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:47,460
different different okay so in this graph you can see the importance

1206
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,490
graph you can see the importance actually for having a protocol to send

1207
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:53,790
actually for having a protocol to send messages notice but here I can

1208
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:56,010
messages notice but here I can simultaneously end this messages that

1209
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:58,920
simultaneously end this messages that you see on a figure B no promises

1210
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,890
you see on a figure B no promises promises all at the time and I can do

1211
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:04,890
promises all at the time and I can do this right because this node all right

1212
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:07,830
this right because this node all right can send the message there all right the

1213
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,330
can send the message there all right the same here same there

1214
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:12,120
same here same there all right so on the second stage I do

1215
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,340
all right so on the second stage I do notice messages with dotted lines to

1216
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:15,840
notice messages with dotted lines to indicate that I calculate them

1217
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,140
indicate that I calculate them previously but once placed no she has

1218
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,610
previously but once placed no she has received messages from the left and the

1219
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:22,680
received messages from the left and the right where they can do it can send the

1220
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:26,730
right where they can do it can send the message to this node and once this node

1221
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:28,950
message to this node and once this node here to receive this to West Michigan's

1222
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:30,489
here to receive this to West Michigan's tell the vessels

1223
01:04:30,489 --> 01:04:34,569
tell the vessels so on the last step you notice I make

1224
01:04:34,569 --> 01:04:37,569
so on the last step you notice I make all these messages about it because they

1225
01:04:37,569 --> 01:04:40,989
all these messages about it because they calculated before and if if this note

1226
01:04:40,989 --> 01:04:43,719
calculated before and if if this note has a message from below has a message

1227
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:46,239
has a message from below has a message already from the right then it can send

1228
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:49,930
already from the right then it can send a message to this node similarly if this

1229
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:52,269
a message to this node similarly if this node has the vessels coming in as a

1230
01:04:52,269 --> 01:04:54,309
node has the vessels coming in as a message from the right it can send a

1231
01:04:54,309 --> 01:04:57,130
message from the right it can send a message to this law okay so you never

1232
01:04:57,130 --> 01:05:00,940
message to this law okay so you never idea that what I mean a part of the

1233
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,829
idea that what I mean a part of the protocol basically for sending messages

1234
01:05:02,829 --> 01:05:06,069
protocol basically for sending messages if you do this sequentially obviously is

1235
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:08,589
if you do this sequentially obviously is not gonna be a good algorithm and

1236
01:05:08,589 --> 01:05:09,880
not gonna be a good algorithm and according the graph is going to be

1237
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:14,589
according the graph is going to be probably if you do this right when the

1238
01:05:14,589 --> 01:05:16,539
probably if you do this right when the algorithm converges basically and gives

1239
01:05:16,539 --> 01:05:19,660
algorithm converges basically and gives you having converted it turns out what

1240
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,910
you having converted it turns out what it finishes the cost will be two times

1241
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:24,339
it finishes the cost will be two times the number of edges because basically in

1242
01:05:24,339 --> 01:05:25,839
the number of edges because basically in every answer you have to send the

1243
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,779
every answer you have to send the messages going and coming back okay as

1244
01:05:28,779 --> 01:05:35,499
messages going and coming back okay as you see here alright so so the number of

1245
01:05:35,499 --> 01:05:37,390
you see here alright so so the number of steps basically the alcohol is placed

1246
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:40,599
steps basically the alcohol is placed two times the number of edges in in in

1247
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:48,460
two times the number of edges in in in you

1248
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:48,470


1249
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:52,090
I mean I think I'm really here taste this

1250
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:54,310
this so the algorithm never blocks you know

1251
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:58,330
so the algorithm never blocks you know for a trade without not happened but if

1252
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:00,580
for a trade without not happened but if later on we will show the algorithm only

1253
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,830
later on we will show the algorithm only have loops it's very possible you have

1254
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:04,810
have loops it's very possible you have an algorithm that keeps going and

1255
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:06,730
an algorithm that keeps going and Everette right

1256
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,320
Everette right keep sending message system you have

1257
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,900
keep sending message system you have constantly on the loop and you're in

1258
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:16,450
constantly on the loop and you're in trouble all right so let me I'm gonna

1259
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:24,130
trouble all right so let me I'm gonna finish this example because is in this

1260
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:25,600
finish this example because is in this is the notation that I'm using is

1261
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:31,120
is the notation that I'm using is basically that of you know a market on

1262
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,440
basically that of you know a market on the field that we used before

1263
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,710
the field that we used before okay so you know we have ten potentials

1264
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:38,920
okay so you know we have ten potentials here and if you want evidence you plug

1265
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:43,090
here and if you want evidence you plug in them two functions as patient

1266
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:44,500
in them two functions as patient slightly different but this for the same

1267
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:49,900
slightly different but this for the same idea so let's say eleven is the node

1268
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:52,900
idea so let's say eleven is the node eleven is the root and we want to

1269
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:55,570
eleven is the root and we want to compute the under some messages first

1270
01:06:55,570 --> 01:07:01,380
compute the under some messages first right and and then compute marginal and

1271
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:01,390


1272
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:10,050
actually let me see if we only want to compute what's going on okay well

1273
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:11,820
compute what's going on okay well there is no particular node of interest

1274
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:14,490
there is no particular node of interest but I will tell you what this specific

1275
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:16,770
but I will tell you what this specific to this example right so let's say we

1276
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:19,200
to this example right so let's say we want to compute this is the root node

1277
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,580
want to compute this is the root node right that we want to compute all the

1278
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:23,610
right that we want to compute all the message 10th on this graph so we're

1279
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:26,300
message 10th on this graph so we're going to do a first order elimination

1280
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,130
going to do a first order elimination can hear somebody spell for me what may

1281
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:30,300
can hear somebody spell for me what may be a first order we'll look on this

1282
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:35,610
be a first order we'll look on this graph there are many orders of

1283
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:37,620
graph there are many orders of eliminating nodes but here's the optimal

1284
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,720
eliminating nodes but here's the optimal is the first order and you remember you

1285
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,960
is the first order and you remember you start from the left tree and then from

1286
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,650
start from the left tree and then from the left side to outside so potentially

1287
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:49,500
the left side to outside so potentially how the first order elimination will

1288
01:07:49,500 --> 01:08:00,370
how the first order elimination will look here 1 2 1 2 3 4

1289
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:00,380


1290
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:05,110
one two seven

1291
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:05,120


1292
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:23,149
alright so 1 mm continuum Philip 7 8 9 5 6 10 and 11 you still at ok

1293
01:08:23,149 --> 01:08:23,159


1294
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:26,870
if you know it offenders to you but I suggest is you can look at the weekly

1295
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:29,780
suggest is you can look at the weekly and Wikipedia you know there is five

1296
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:32,149
and Wikipedia you know there is five different types of ordering but the

1297
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:33,439
different types of ordering but the first one there is basically what is

1298
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:36,740
first one there is basically what is used for bottom elimination on three so

1299
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,180
used for bottom elimination on three so this is what we need to use here

1300
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,910
this is what we need to use here I mean you something else it's just

1301
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:43,519
I mean you something else it's just assumed that part will be higher than

1302
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:47,090
assumed that part will be higher than using a posthole okay so if you were

1303
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,669
using a posthole okay so if you were gonna do calculations basically

1304
01:08:48,669 --> 01:08:58,729
gonna do calculations basically analytically okay so alright the

1305
01:08:58,729 --> 01:09:00,860
analytically okay so alright the elimination and we're gonna start to

1306
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:03,680
elimination and we're gonna start to calculate messages okay

1307
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:06,439
calculate messages okay so I can calculate the message from node

1308
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:10,220
so I can calculate the message from node 1 to 7 is this calculation make sense to

1309
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:11,590
1 to 7 is this calculation make sense to you

1310
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:14,329
you there is no incoming message to node 1

1311
01:09:14,329 --> 01:09:16,789
there is no incoming message to node 1 so this situation of the potential try 1

1312
01:09:16,789 --> 01:09:19,579
so this situation of the potential try 1 7 okay

1313
01:09:19,579 --> 01:09:21,680
7 okay I can do a calculation of 2 to 7 at the

1314
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,740
I can do a calculation of 2 to 7 at the same time no problem this is I can do

1315
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:31,820
same time no problem this is I can do the calculation of 3 2 8 4 2 8 5 to 10 6

1316
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:34,010
the calculation of 3 2 8 4 2 8 5 to 10 6 to 10 all right so I can do the

1317
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,870
to 10 all right so I can do the calculation the first 2 lines all

1318
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:40,490
calculation the first 2 lines all simultaneously on this graph so now I

1319
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:43,849
simultaneously on this graph so now I need to calculate the potential from I

1320
01:09:43,849 --> 01:09:46,910
need to calculate the potential from I mean the message from 7 to 9 and again

1321
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:49,189
mean the message from 7 to 9 and again no equations are needed right so what

1322
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:52,220
no equations are needed right so what you need to do is find all the messages

1323
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:54,560
you need to do is find all the messages are coming to notes level multiplied

1324
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,590
are coming to notes level multiplied with the potential between 7 and 9 and

1325
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:59,240
with the potential between 7 and 9 and get rid of 7 eliminate them

1326
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,720
get rid of 7 eliminate them so basically the message from 7 to 9 is

1327
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:06,890
so basically the message from 7 to 9 is this potential 7 9 if you can of course

1328
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:10,220
this potential 7 9 if you can of course the evidence for 7 you can but in also

1329
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:12,919
the evidence for 7 you can but in also the message from 1 to 7 the message from

1330
01:10:12,919 --> 01:10:15,950
the message from 1 to 7 the message from 2 to 7 so obviously this requires that

1331
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:16,970
2 to 7 so obviously this requires that you already have done this calculation

1332
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:20,090
you already have done this calculation the first 2 lakhs similarly you can

1333
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:24,020
the first 2 lakhs similarly you can calculate the message from 8 9 ok the

1334
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,820
calculate the message from 8 9 ok the two incoming messages times this

1335
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:27,060
two incoming messages times this potential and then

1336
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:33,060
potential and then lay it out and then let's see and then

1337
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,589
lay it out and then let's see and then we need to calculate the message from

1338
01:10:34,589 --> 01:10:35,490
we need to calculate the message from nine to eleven

1339
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:39,030
nine to eleven so this again nothing special the

1340
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:42,270
so this again nothing special the potential of nine and eleven course that

1341
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:43,680
potential of nine and eleven course that okay

1342
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:45,990
okay the incoming mr. seventy-nine becoming

1343
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,760
the incoming mr. seventy-nine becoming less to eight to nine and then

1344
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,580
less to eight to nine and then integrating x9 out and similarly the

1345
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,910
integrating x9 out and similarly the message compared to 11 so this time the

1346
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:58,100
message compared to 11 so this time the message is coming from the list today

1347
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:05,870
message is coming from the list today okay now let me try the worst sort of

1348
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:09,240
okay now let me try the worst sort of elementary way of completing this

1349
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:12,030
elementary way of completing this message from nine to eleven right so

1350
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:16,290
message from nine to eleven right so basically I'm going to solve this in a

1351
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:18,030
basically I'm going to solve this in a different mathematical form so you can

1352
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:20,399
different mathematical form so you can get a sense of what this actually does

1353
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:21,060
get a sense of what this actually does right

1354
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:23,780
right so the message from nine to eleven

1355
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:27,300
so the message from nine to eleven effectively we start with this note we

1356
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,680
effectively we start with this note we sell information and then we eliminate

1357
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:31,319
sell information and then we eliminate the two misinformation they're in there

1358
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:33,510
the two misinformation they're in there and then we eliminate two nodes and then

1359
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:34,859
and then we eliminate two nodes and then from here to they are very willing in

1360
01:11:34,859 --> 01:11:37,020
from here to they are very willing in eight nine respectively you know what we

1361
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,270
eight nine respectively you know what we have eliminated to send a message from

1362
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:44,280
have eliminated to send a message from nine to 11 with the most can you tell me

1363
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,530
nine to 11 with the most can you tell me to eventually be ready to sent a message

1364
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:50,390
to eventually be ready to sent a message from 9 to 11 you have eliminated what

1365
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:52,919
from 9 to 11 you have eliminated what you have enumerate the lots of nodes but

1366
01:11:52,919 --> 01:11:58,290
you have enumerate the lots of nodes but this works together some work for the

1367
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:00,930
this works together some work for the subtree the comes from the left of the

1368
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:04,290
subtree the comes from the left of the left

1369
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:04,300


1370
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:09,089
you see that I mean all of this no it says the three that really if you take

1371
01:12:09,089 --> 01:12:11,669
says the three that really if you take node 11 and you can't get from there all

1372
01:12:11,669 --> 01:12:13,530
node 11 and you can't get from there all the nodes to the left without this with

1373
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:15,419
the nodes to the left without this with you demon eight so I can write this

1374
01:12:15,419 --> 01:12:17,609
you demon eight so I can write this compilation of the message from nine to

1375
01:12:17,609 --> 01:12:19,950
compilation of the message from nine to eleven estimation on all of these

1376
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:22,439
eleven estimation on all of these variables of this subtree and I quote

1377
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:24,780
variables of this subtree and I quote based on three the subtree that is

1378
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:28,470
based on three the subtree that is derived once I remove ads 911 okay

1379
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:31,770
derived once I remove ads 911 okay so this is the tree that you get once

1380
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:33,899
so this is the tree that you get once you eliminate this edge from nine to

1381
01:12:33,899 --> 01:12:34,379
you eliminate this edge from nine to eleven

1382
01:12:34,379 --> 01:12:37,709
eleven okay so effectively this is the message

1383
01:12:37,709 --> 01:12:43,979
okay so effectively this is the message this is what we have done now what also

1384
01:12:43,979 --> 01:12:46,620
this is what we have done now what also this means right but this calculation

1385
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:48,660
this means right but this calculation that we had from the lessons is you can

1386
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:51,030
that we had from the lessons is you can start from this equation all right and

1387
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:53,669
start from this equation all right and we arrange the order of estimations and

1388
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:55,890
we arrange the order of estimations and then you can redefine again these

1389
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:58,530
then you can redefine again these messages that are propagating from 1 and

1390
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:01,260
messages that are propagating from 1 and 2 to 7 from seven to nine etcetera as

1391
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:03,060
2 to 7 from seven to nine etcetera as part of this semester's there is nothing

1392
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:05,040
part of this semester's there is nothing really special it's a way that we do the

1393
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,780
really special it's a way that we do the summations so rather than doing the

1394
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:10,290
summations so rather than doing the summations is one big equation you do it

1395
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:13,350
summations is one big equation you do it in some elimination order right the way

1396
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:16,410
in some elimination order right the way that is discussed here so we don't go

1397
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:17,850
that is discussed here so we don't go and do all of the summations in one

1398
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:19,890
and do all of the summations in one equation so don't write a computer

1399
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:22,470
equation so don't write a computer program and say go and some on all of

1400
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:24,720
program and say go and some on all of this because it's a tree of trivial toy

1401
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,120
this because it's a tree of trivial toy problem and that's the answer you need

1402
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,580
problem and that's the answer you need to compute you say waste all these nodes

1403
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:31,740
to compute you say waste all these nodes in some order and start computing is

1404
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,390
in some order and start computing is message this and one of these now this

1405
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:35,939
message this and one of these now this master arrived compute you know the

1406
01:13:35,939 --> 01:13:38,069
master arrived compute you know the messages outgoing from that node to

1407
01:13:38,069 --> 01:13:40,200
messages outgoing from that node to another node you know and when you get

1408
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,000
another node you know and when you get all of these things from the list to the

1409
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,129
all of these things from the list to the root then you are ready to go backwards

1410
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:48,479
root then you are ready to go backwards and here is buckled the questions from

1411
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:49,049
and here is buckled the questions from awkward

1412
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:53,220
awkward recalcitrant of messages identical to

1413
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,299
recalcitrant of messages identical to what we have seen before

1414
01:13:54,299 --> 01:14:00,799
what we have seen before okay so let me give him

1415
01:14:00,799 --> 01:14:00,809


1416
01:14:00,809 --> 01:14:08,849
some of these equations and I put this things in blue because I think the first

1417
01:14:08,849 --> 01:14:11,839
things in blue because I think the first time I typed them not paying attention I

1418
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:17,669
time I typed them not paying attention I had missed the loss of these terms right

1419
01:14:17,669 --> 01:14:20,040
had missed the loss of these terms right because some of these terms you realized

1420
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,589
because some of these terms you realized our message the pairing from the right

1421
01:14:22,589 --> 01:14:25,020
our message the pairing from the right way that runs out of 11 not from the

1422
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:28,829
way that runs out of 11 not from the left so let's take from node 11 to send

1423
01:14:28,829 --> 01:14:31,229
left so let's take from node 11 to send a message to node 9 what do I need to

1424
01:14:31,229 --> 01:14:33,959
a message to node 9 what do I need to know when a node can send messages to

1425
01:14:33,959 --> 01:14:36,799
know when a node can send messages to any other node

1426
01:14:36,799 --> 01:14:39,439
any other node what is the protocol that we discussed

1427
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:49,109
what is the protocol that we discussed to send the message

1428
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:49,119


1429
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:56,850
okay - sent a masters from 11 to 9 what does not what is the protocol when can

1430
01:14:56,850 --> 01:15:01,169
does not what is the protocol when can 11 send the message to genomic when it

1431
01:15:01,169 --> 01:15:04,859
11 send the message to genomic when it only has received all messages from its

1432
01:15:04,859 --> 01:15:07,770
only has received all messages from its neighbors and the neighbors here except

1433
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:15,180
neighbors and the neighbors here except 9 is no 10 alright so for 11 to send a

1434
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:18,089
9 is no 10 alright so for 11 to send a message to 911 history see the rest is

1435
01:15:18,089 --> 01:15:20,580
message to 911 history see the rest is from 10 he needs to have no post message

1436
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:24,359
from 10 he needs to have no post message on here all right obviously captain

1437
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:25,620
on here all right obviously captain based in the picture but missed the

1438
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:30,120
based in the picture but missed the message that pen sends to you ever all

1439
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,790
message that pen sends to you ever all right so basically the message from 11

1440
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:38,129
right so basically the message from 11 to 9 is this potential with the message

1441
01:15:38,129 --> 01:15:41,280
to 9 is this potential with the message coming from 10 to 11 and then node 11

1442
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:46,050
coming from 10 to 11 and then node 11 eliminate similarly if you want to

1443
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:48,450
eliminate similarly if you want to compute the lessees 11 cents to 10 would

1444
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:50,370
compute the lessees 11 cents to 10 would be the potential of 11 and 10 and the

1445
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:59,310
be the potential of 11 and 10 and the message coming from 9-11 etc etc okay

1446
01:15:59,310 --> 01:15:59,320


1447
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:05,970
so the mystery of presenting and so basically if you want to say a physical

1448
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:07,859
basically if you want to say a physical sort of interpretation of the

1449
01:16:07,859 --> 01:16:10,169
sort of interpretation of the calculation we did for sending a message

1450
01:16:10,169 --> 01:16:15,510
calculation we did for sending a message 11 from 11 to 9 effectively what you can

1451
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:17,580
11 from 11 to 9 effectively what you can envision is if you look at the right

1452
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:22,410
envision is if you look at the right subtree right the subtree basically that

1453
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:25,919
subtree right the subtree basically that you get when you eliminate the X 9 to 11

1454
01:16:25,919 --> 01:16:28,500
you get when you eliminate the X 9 to 11 all right and then you do elimination of

1455
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:31,290
all right and then you do elimination of all the nodes in the subtree okay and

1456
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:35,339
all the nodes in the subtree okay and that means you some on 5 to 10 and 11 of

1457
01:16:35,339 --> 01:16:37,620
that means you some on 5 to 10 and 11 of the potentials corresponding to this

1458
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:41,100
the potentials corresponding to this subject okay so if you do this basically

1459
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,800
subject okay so if you do this basically what you will get is you will get this

1460
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,839
what you will get is you will get this calculation at the end of the day okay

1461
01:16:45,839 --> 01:16:47,939
calculation at the end of the day okay but obviously this gives you a way to

1462
01:16:47,939 --> 01:16:53,520
but obviously this gives you a way to remember so I don't have time to finish

1463
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,209
remember so I don't have time to finish this 145 but what I suggest this look at

1464
01:16:57,209 --> 01:16:59,879
this 145 but what I suggest this look at the algorithm because there is a stream

1465
01:16:59,879 --> 01:17:03,240
the algorithm because there is a stream and the local ibid sort of complicated

1466
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,830
and the local ibid sort of complicated so the algorithm for setting the

1467
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:07,459
so the algorithm for setting the postorder it's very progressive always

1468
01:17:07,459 --> 01:17:11,100
postorder it's very progressive always 25 lines okay and it does this correctly

1469
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:15,930
25 lines okay and it does this correctly okay and the sum for the algorithms will

1470
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:18,089
okay and the sum for the algorithms will describe this basically little

1471
01:17:18,089 --> 01:17:22,500
describe this basically little difference from elimination algorithm

1472
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:25,229
difference from elimination algorithm and it is the custom in there in nature

1473
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:28,020
and it is the custom in there in nature for example collecting messages before

1474
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,970
for example collecting messages before you are ready to propagate it's a

1475
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:31,879
you are ready to propagate it's a recursive algorithm even tree

1476
01:17:31,879 --> 01:17:34,020
recursive algorithm even tree distributing message from a node to the

1477
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:36,089
distributing message from a node to the leg lifts is also a recursive algorithm

1478
01:17:36,089 --> 01:17:41,310
leg lifts is also a recursive algorithm so I'm really like you know you guys to

1479
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:42,660
so I'm really like you know you guys to make an attempt to at least program

1480
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:45,600
make an attempt to at least program something that involves inference on

1481
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,300
something that involves inference on twist because sort of an is y'all going

1482
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:52,200
twist because sort of an is y'all going okay so and as I mentioned those who are

1483
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,729
okay so and as I mentioned those who are auditing the course if you don't really

1484
01:17:53,729 --> 01:17:55,890
auditing the course if you don't really program these things there is no way

1485
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:56,430
program these things there is no way actually

1486
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:58,110
actually you'll never figure out how this thing

1487
01:17:58,110 --> 01:18:01,949
you'll never figure out how this thing works now if
