00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:05,169
几乎完成了，所以如果没有发布，我会给您发送
so if not posted I will send you an email with them all right

123
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:08,789
向他们发送电子邮件
so if not posted I will send you an email with them all right

124
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:09,260
嗯，与SSM基本上，图形模型是相同的，
so if not posted I will send you an email with them all right

125
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:09,270
嗯，与SSM基本上，图形模型是相同的，


126
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,760
嗯，与SSM基本上，图形模型是相同的，
hmm versus SSM basically the graphical model is identical would have an

127
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:14,770
嗯，与SSM基本上，图形模型是相同的，
model is identical would have an evolving state Z so that's how a

128
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,730
演化状态Z，所以这是一个动力学系统，然后我们有了一些
model is identical would have an evolving state Z so that's how a

129
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,159
演化状态Z，所以这是一个动力学系统，然后我们有了一些
evolving state Z so that's how a dynamical system and then we have some

130
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:20,169
演化状态Z，所以这是一个动力学系统，然后我们有了一些
dynamical system and then we have some noisy observations that there why the

131
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,770
嘈杂的观察表明，为什么唯一的区别是铬化了一些敌人
dynamical system and then we have some noisy observations that there why the

132
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,689
嘈杂的观察表明，为什么唯一的区别是铬化了一些敌人
noisy observations that there why the only difference chromate some enemies in

133
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:24,699
嘈杂的观察表明，为什么唯一的区别是铬化了一些敌人
only difference chromate some enemies in the hmm model like you know in the

134
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,430
您在模拟器高斯混合模型中所知道的hmm模型

00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,920
不屑一顾的Oliver将在这里离散C变量是连续的
dismissive oliver's will discrete here the C variables are continuous that's

139
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:34,930
不屑一顾的Oliver将在这里离散C变量是连续的
the C variables are continuous that's the only difference

140
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,850
唯一的区别还可以，所以除了制作东西
the C variables are continuous that's the only difference

141
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,189
唯一的区别还可以，所以除了制作东西
the only difference okay so in addition to just make things

142
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
唯一的区别还可以，所以除了制作东西
okay so in addition to just make things a little bit more interesting we have

143
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,499
有点有趣的是，我们在动态
okay so in addition to just make things a little bit more interesting we have

144
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:46,140
有点有趣的是，我们在动态
a little bit more interesting we have sort of introduced in both the dynamical

145
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,150
有点有趣的是，我们在动态
sort of introduced in both the dynamical and the observation model some impede

146
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,420
和观察模型，您可以想到一些阻碍变量的因素
sort of introduced in both the dynamical and the observation model some impede

147
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,210
和观察模型，您可以想到一些阻碍变量的因素
and the observation model some impede variable you that you can think of it

148
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:51,220
和观察模型，您可以想到一些阻碍变量的因素
variable you that you can think of it being sort of some crossing term that

149
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,820
是您规定的一些交叉术语，酒店不是
variable you that you can think of it being sort of some crossing term that

150
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,390
是您规定的一些交叉术语，酒店不是
being sort of some crossing term that you prescribe alright the hotel is not

151
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:57,400
是您规定的一些交叉术语，酒店不是
you prescribe alright the hotel is not there there is nothing that it falls

152
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,999
没有什么可以回溯到我们以前拥有的模型了
you prescribe alright the hotel is not there there is nothing that it falls

153
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:02,390
没有什么可以回溯到我们以前拥有的模型了
there there is nothing that it falls back to the previous models we had so

154
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
没有什么可以回溯到我们以前拥有的模型了
back to the previous models we had so the general assistant model we have the

155
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,450
在一般的辅助模型中，我们用这个方程式来描述动力学。
back to the previous models we had so the general assistant model we have the

156
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,370
在一般的辅助模型中，我们用这个方程式来描述动力学。
the general assistant model we have the dynamic described by this equation in a

157
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:11,380
在一般的辅助模型中，我们用这个方程式来描述动力学。
dynamic described by this equation in a very general form we're going to

158
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,320
非常一般的形式，我们将简化，因此这是一些
dynamic described by this equation in a very general form we're going to

159
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,469
非常一般的形式，我们将简化，因此这是一些
very general form we're going to simplify of course so that this is some

160
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
非常一般的形式，我们将简化，因此这是一些
simplify of course so that this is some easy function to work

161
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,940
易于使用的功能，因此这里是输入城市-其中之一
simplify of course so that this is some easy function to work

162
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,990
易于使用的功能，因此这里是输入城市-其中之一
easy function to work so here is the input city - one of the

163
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
易于使用的功能，因此这里是输入城市-其中之一
so here is the input city - one of the state that the - Rana and some noise and

164
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,030
指出-拉纳（Rana）和一些噪声以及观测值基本上也有一个
so here is the input city - one of the state that the - Rana and some noise and

165
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,780
指出-拉纳（Rana）和一些噪声以及观测值基本上也有一个
state that the - Rana and some noise and the observations basically also has a

166
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:27,790
指出-拉纳（Rana）和一些噪声以及观测值基本上也有一个
the observations basically also has a u-turn it depends only on Z at the same

167
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,710
掉头它仅取决于Z，而同时T也有它自己的噪声，所以
the observations basically also has a u-turn it depends only on Z at the same

168
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:37,290
掉头它仅取决于Z，而同时T也有它自己的噪声，所以
u-turn it depends only on Z at the same time T it has its own noise as well so

169
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:37,300
掉头它仅取决于Z，而同时T也有它自己的噪声，所以
time T it has its own noise as well so really very so this is identical to what

170
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,200
非常非常，所以这与我们对hmm所做的相同，实际上我们对您说过
time T it has its own noise as well so really very so this is identical to what

171
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,350
非常非常，所以这与我们对hmm所做的相同，实际上我们对您说过
really very so this is identical to what we did with hmm actually hmm we said you

172
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
非常非常，所以这与我们对hmm所做的相同，实际上我们对您说过
we did with hmm actually hmm we said you can put there's an observation anything

173
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,510
可以对您想要的任何事物进行观察，我们为
we did with hmm actually hmm we said you can put there's an observation anything

174
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,490
可以对您想要的任何事物进行观察，我们为
can put there's an observation anything you want to and we did the case for

175
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:47,500
可以对您想要的任何事物进行观察，我们为
you want to and we did the case for example with a Gaussian model but right

176
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,470
高斯模型的例子，但是现在这可以是高斯模型，并且可以
you want to and we did the case for example with a Gaussian model but right

177
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,080
高斯模型的例子，但是现在这可以是高斯模型，并且可以
example with a Gaussian model but right now this can be a Gaussian and this can

178
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,090
高斯模型的例子，但是现在这可以是高斯模型，并且可以
now this can be a Gaussian and this can be a Gaucher all right okay sort of a

179
00:06:52,090 --> 00:07:03,240
成为Gaucher好吧，好吧，这是一些开始的问题
now this can be a Gaussian and this can be a Gaucher all right okay sort of a

180
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,240
成为Gaucher好吧，好吧，这是一些开始的问题
be a Gaucher all right okay sort of a number of problems that they are started

181
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,250
成为Gaucher好吧，好吧，这是一些开始的问题
number of problems that they are started in the context of data simulation and

182
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,050
在数据模拟的情况下，对于SSM来说，最好的是相同的，所以
number of problems that they are started in the context of data simulation and

183
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,030
在数据模拟的情况下，对于SSM来说，最好的是相同的，所以
in the context of data simulation and best ones are identical for SSM okay so

184
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,040
在数据模拟的情况下，对于SSM来说，最好的是相同的，所以
best ones are identical for SSM okay so the what's the name we gave to

185
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,040
我们给这个估计的名字是什么我们怎么称呼这个
best ones are identical for SSM okay so the what's the name we gave to

186
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,400
我们给这个估计的名字是什么我们怎么称呼这个
the what's the name we gave to estimating this how do we call this

00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:31,240
我们给它起的名字是什么，它是通用名称，我的意思是你需要知道
universal name I mean you need to know this because it comes to everywhere so

193
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,330
这是因为它涉及到无处不在，所以我们称呼他们为我们所说的

195
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:34,900
这是因为它涉及到无处不在，所以我们称呼他们为我们所说的
what they did we call how do we call this distribution

196
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,200
这个分布是舞台的后部，但是
what they did we call how do we call this distribution

197
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,210
这个分布是舞台的后部，但是
this distribution it's a posterior of the stage right but

198
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:39,220
这个分布是舞台的后部，但是
it's a posterior of the stage right but we gave a name we call it something in

199
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,970
我们给了一个名字，我们称它为小孩子，你会看到它
it's a posterior of the stage right but we gave a name we call it something in

200
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,370
我们给了一个名字，我们称它为小孩子，你会看到它
we gave a name we call it something in the little children you will see it with

201
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:44,380
我们给了一个名字，我们称它为小孩子，你会看到它
the little children you will see it with the name what's the name it's not the

202
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,250
这个名字是什么名字，不是中立的名字，你知道这是一个名字

the name what's the name it's not the name of neutral you know it's a name

204
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:49,660
这个名字是什么名字，不是中立的名字，你知道这是一个名字
name of neutral you know it's a name that defines in words what this

205
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,510
用语言定义了这个分布是关于什么的，那是什么
name of neutral you know it's a name that defines in words what this

206
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:56,760
用语言定义了这个分布是关于什么的，那是什么
that defines in words what this distribution is about so what was it

207
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,350
嗯，正好
that defines in words what this distribution is about so what was it

208
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
嗯，正好


209
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,460

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,210
过滤分布是否正确，所以该分布称为
is the filtering distribution all right so this distribution is known as the

213
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:08,220
过滤分布是否正确，所以该分布称为
so this distribution is known as the filtering distribution okay

214
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,969
过滤分布好吧，我们讨论吸烟
so this distribution is known as the filtering distribution okay

215
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:12,619
过滤分布好吧，我们讨论吸烟
filtering distribution okay we discuss about the smoking

216
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:12,629
过滤分布好吧，我们讨论吸烟
we discuss about the smoking distribution I think I'm going to come

217
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,059

219
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:16,979
分布我想我会回到它的位置，所以在今天早上
back to it so in the in this morning distribution is basically the estimation

220
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,700
分布基本上是ZT的估算值，而不是使用直到
back to it so in the in this morning distribution is basically the estimation

221
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,589
分布基本上是ZT的估算值，而不是使用直到
distribution is basically the estimation of ZT but instead of using data up to

222
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
分布基本上是ZT的估算值，而不是使用直到
of ZT but instead of using data up to time T you have all the data up to the

223
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,659
时间T您拥有所有数据直到结束
of ZT but instead of using data up to time T you have all the data up to the

224
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:24,439
时间T您拥有所有数据直到结束
time T you have all the data up to the end

225
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:24,449
时间T您拥有所有数据直到结束
end capital T okay so this is the filtering

226
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:27,290
资本T好的，所以这是过滤分布，当然这是
end capital T okay so this is the filtering

227
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,510
资本T好的，所以这是过滤分布，当然这是
capital T okay so this is the filtering distribution and of course this is the

228
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
资本T好的，所以这是过滤分布，当然这是
distribution and of course this is the prediction distribution where you don't

229
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,730
预测分布，通过创建很多
distribution and of course this is the prediction distribution where you don't

230
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,670
预测分布，通过创建很多
prediction distribution where you don't really care about Z by making a lots of

231
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:34,680
预测分布，通过创建很多
really care about Z by making a lots of promise but you want to know what's the

232
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,589
答应，但您想知道下一次测量的概率是多少
really care about Z by making a lots of promise but you want to know what's the

233
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,630
答应，但您想知道下一次测量的概率是多少
promise but you want to know what's the probability of your next measurement if

234
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,640
答应，但您想知道下一次测量的概率是多少
probability of your next measurement if you already have data up to time T right

235
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,360
您已经有时间到T的数据了，所以我们为hmm做了所有的工作
probability of your next measurement if you already have data up to time T right

236
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,000
您已经有时间到T的数据了，所以我们为hmm做了所有的工作
you already have data up to time T right so there's all the points we did for hmm

237
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,010
您已经有时间到T的数据了，所以我们为hmm做了所有的工作
so there's all the points we did for hmm are basically the same problems in any

238
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,240
在任何数据刺激情况下基本上都是相同的问题，如果是嗯
so there's all the points we did for hmm are basically the same problems in any

239
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,389
在任何数据刺激情况下基本上都是相同的问题，如果是嗯
are basically the same problems in any data stimulation case okay if it is hmm

240
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
在任何数据刺激情况下基本上都是相同的问题，如果是嗯
data stimulation case okay if it is hmm masters time or anything else the same

243
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:54,209
掌握时间或其他与电动打印机相同的问题
sort of problems with power printers okay the most standard problem all right

244
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:58,880
好吧，最标准的问题好吧，也许任何电气专业的学生
sort of problems with power printers okay the most standard problem all right

something the whole subject area is about this the same festival ok so this

373
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,090
关于同一节日，好吧，这是对象标记的一个例子，让我们
something the whole subject area is about this the same festival ok so this

374
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,990
关于同一节日，好吧，这是对象标记的一个例子，让我们
about this the same festival ok so this is an example of object marking so let's

375
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,000
关于同一节日，好吧，这是对象标记的一个例子，让我们
is an example of object marking so let's say you're tracking and a missile and

376
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,900
说您正在追踪并发射导弹，并且您对某个状态感兴趣
is an example of object marking so let's say you're tracking and a missile and

377
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,260
说您正在追踪并发射导弹，并且您对某个状态感兴趣
say you're tracking and a missile and you're interested on a state that is

378
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,270
说您正在追踪并发射导弹，并且您对某个状态感兴趣
you're interested on a state that is defined basically by the location of the

379
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,660
基本上由导弹的位置定义
you're interested on a state that is defined basically by the location of the

380
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,350
基本上由导弹的位置定义
defined basically by the location of the missile

381
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:03,360
基本上由导弹的位置定义
missile this is sort of a Miss I won't even a

382
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,180
这有点像小姐，我什至不会在飞机上另一个愚蠢的问题
missile this is sort of a Miss I won't even a

383
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,570
这有点像小姐，我什至不会在飞机上另一个愚蠢的问题
this is sort of a Miss I won't even a plane another stupid problem in the

384
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:08,580
这有点像小姐，我什至不会在飞机上另一个愚蠢的问题
plane another stupid problem in the rotation here but Z 1 T and Z 2 T you

385
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,090
旋转，但Z 1 T和Z 2 T可以认为是X我的位置和0 1
plane another stupid problem in the rotation here but Z 1 T and Z 2 T you

386
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,650
旋转，但Z 1 T和Z 2 T可以认为是X我的位置和0 1
rotation here but Z 1 T and Z 2 T you can think being X my location and 0 1

387
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:15,660
旋转，但Z 1 T和Z 2 T可以认为是X我的位置和0 1
can think being X my location and 0 1 and 0 to being the speeds in the x and y

388
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,079
和0表示在x和y方向上的速度好吧，你真的
can think being X my location and 0 1 and 0 to being the speeds in the x and y

389
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,170
和0表示在x和y方向上的速度好吧，你真的
and 0 to being the speeds in the x and y direction okay you are really

390
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:21,180
和0表示在x和y方向上的速度好吧，你真的
direction okay you are really interesting to compute all of this

391
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,140
有趣地独立计算所有这些，因为您必须
direction okay you are really interesting to compute all of this

392
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,100
有趣地独立计算所有这些，因为您必须
interesting to compute all of this independently because you have to

393
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,110
有趣地独立计算所有这些，因为您必须
independently because you have to calculate somehow let's say to the

394
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,750
计算一下，让我们说到最后，然后您尝试做
independently because you have to calculate somehow let's say to the

395
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,610
计算一下，让我们说到最后，然后您尝试做
calculate somehow let's say to the lastest and then you try to do

396
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:28,620
计算一下，让我们说到最后，然后您尝试做
lastest and then you try to do integration on this you're not going to

397
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,710
对此进行集成，您将无法获得非常准确的结果，因为
lastest and then you try to do integration on this you're not going to

398
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,199
对此进行集成，您将无法获得非常准确的结果，因为
integration on this you're not going to get very accurate results right because

399
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:33,209
对此进行集成，您将无法获得非常准确的结果，因为
get very accurate results right because then we are going to have to worry about

400
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:34,300
那么我们将不得不担心分化整合的错误
get very accurate results right because then we are going to have to worry about

401
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,920
那么我们将不得不担心分化整合的错误
then we are going to have to worry about error of integration of differentiation

402
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:36,930
那么我们将不得不担心分化整合的错误
error of integration of differentiation depending what variables we take country

403
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,870
取决于我们将国家/地区作为变量的依据，因此会杀死这些地理位置和
error of integration of differentiation depending what variables we take country

404
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,560
取决于我们将国家/地区作为变量的依据，因此会杀死这些地理位置和
depending what variables we take country so kills these both the location and the

405
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:42,570
取决于我们将国家/地区作为变量的依据，因此会杀死这些地理位置和
so kills these both the location and the speed of the object but what we need to

406
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,530
物体的速度，但是我们需要谈什么，所以动力学问题看起来像
so kills these both the location and the speed of the object but what we need to

407
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,050
物体的速度，但是我们需要谈什么，所以动力学问题看起来像
speed of the object but what we need to talk so the dynamical problem looks like

408
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,060
物体的速度，但是我们需要谈什么，所以动力学问题看起来像
talk so the dynamical problem looks like this ok and I'm going to give you

409
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,360
好的，我将给您明确的信息，以便您说服
talk so the dynamical problem looks like this ok and I'm going to give you

410
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,949
好的，我将给您明确的信息，以便您说服
this ok and I'm going to give you explicitly so you can convince

411
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:51,959
好的，我将给您明确的信息，以便您说服
explicitly so you can convince yourselves that there's nothing really

412
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,400
你们自己没有什么真正复杂的，所以再次0 1让我们忘记
explicitly so you can convince yourselves that there's nothing really

413
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,329
你们自己没有什么真正复杂的，所以再次0 1让我们忘记
yourselves that there's nothing really complicated so again 0 1 let's forget

414
00:13:59,329 --> 00:13:59,339
你们自己没有什么真正复杂的，所以再次0 1让我们忘记
complicated so again 0 1 let's forget that busy one is the explication the Y

415
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,180
那个忙碌的人是Y位置的例证，所以如果你看第一个
complicated so again 0 1 let's forget that busy one is the explication the Y

416
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,000
那个忙碌的人是Y位置的例证，所以如果你看第一个
that busy one is the explication the Y location so if you look at the the first

417
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,010
那个忙碌的人是Y位置的例证，所以如果你看第一个
location so if you look at the the first equation this one

418
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,820
等式这个这个加上这个知识留下来
location so if you look at the the first equation this one

419
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,830
等式这个这个加上这个知识留下来
equation this one this Plus this knowledge it stays that

420
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:08,840
等式这个这个加上这个知识留下来
this Plus this knowledge it stays that the actual location is the X location of

421
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,770
实际位置是前一次的X位置加上Delta，即
this Plus this knowledge it stays that the actual location is the X location of

422
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,660
实际位置是前一次的X位置加上Delta，即
the actual location is the X location of the previous time plus Delta which is

423
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:13,670
实际位置是前一次的X位置加上Delta，即
the previous time plus Delta which is the time step you can film of

424
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,400
您可以拍摄积分的时间步长乘以速度
the previous time plus Delta which is the time step you can film of

425
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,530
您可以拍摄积分的时间步长乘以速度
the time step you can film of integration times the velocity of the

426
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:17,540
您可以拍摄积分的时间步长乘以速度
integration times the velocity of the previous time

427
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,280
以前的时间，这就像一个明确的时间
integration times the velocity of the previous time

428
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,660
以前的时间，这就像一个明确的时间
previous time this is like an explicit time

429
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:19,670
以前的时间，这就像一个明确的时间
this is like an explicit time integration scheme okay and then you

430
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,460
积分方案还可以，那么您会有一些高斯噪声，并且在
this is like an explicit time integration scheme okay and then you

431
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,130
积分方案还可以，那么您会有一些高斯噪声，并且在
integration scheme okay and then you have some Gaussian noise and in the

432
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:24,140
积分方案还可以，那么您会有一些高斯噪声，并且在
have some Gaussian noise and in the context of the velocities you don't do

433
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,480
速度的上下文，您什么也不做，您说速度是
have some Gaussian noise and in the context of the velocities you don't do

434
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,150
速度的上下文，您什么也不做，您说速度是
context of the velocities you don't do anything you say this velocity is the

435
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
速度的上下文，您什么也不做，您说速度是
anything you say this velocity is the previous velocity plus some notes okay

436
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,310
以前的速度加上一些音符还可以
anything you say this velocity is the previous velocity plus some notes okay

437
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,340
观察结果又是一个像这样的线性模型，所以让我们看看
anything you say this velocity is the previous velocity plus some notes okay

438
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,350
观察结果又是一个像这样的线性模型，所以让我们看看


439
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:41,260
观察结果又是一个像这样的线性模型，所以让我们看看
and the observations again it's a linear model like that so let's see exactly

440
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,270
观察结果又是一个像这样的线性模型，所以让我们看看
model like that so let's see exactly what are the observations look like so

441
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,690
观察结果是什么样子，所以假设您正在观察位置
model like that so let's see exactly what are the observations look like so

442
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,060
观察结果是什么样子，所以假设您正在观察位置
what are the observations look like so let's say you are observing the location

443
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,070
观察结果是什么样子，所以假设您正在观察位置
let's say you are observing the location of the missile so you basically want

444
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,340
导弹，因此您基本上想从该向量到Z向量再到X加Z 1 2
let's say you are observing the location of the missile so you basically want

445
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,920
导弹，因此您基本上想从该向量到Z向量再到X加Z 1 2
of the missile so you basically want from this to Z vector to X plus Z 1 2

446
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,930
导弹，因此您基本上想从该向量到Z向量再到X加Z 1 2
from this to Z vector to X plus Z 1 2 and Z 2 T so you basically have 1 1 and

447
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,600
和Z 2 T，所以你基本上有1 1，其余的为0加一些噪声好吗a
from this to Z vector to X plus Z 1 2 and Z 2 T so you basically have 1 1 and

448
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,730
和Z 2 T，所以你基本上有1 1，其余的为0加一些噪声好吗a
and Z 2 T so you basically have 1 1 and the rest to 0 plus some noise okay a

449
00:14:59,730 --> 00:14:59,740
和Z 2 T，所以你基本上有1 1，其余的为0加一些噪声好吗a
the rest to 0 plus some noise okay a visit for that when I start that

450
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,590
为此，当我开始时一切都是高斯式的，您必须
the rest to 0 plus some noise okay a visit for that when I start that

451
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,270
为此，当我开始时一切都是高斯式的，您必须
visit for that when I start that everything is Gaussian right you have to

452
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:04,280
为此，当我开始时一切都是高斯式的，您必须
everything is Gaussian right you have to start with a distribution of the state

453
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,310
从国家的分布开始也是什么高斯，因为如果我把
everything is Gaussian right you have to start with a distribution of the state

454
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,120
从国家的分布开始也是什么高斯，因为如果我把
start with a distribution of the state also what is Gaussian because if I put

455
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,130
从国家的分布开始也是什么高斯，因为如果我把
also what is Gaussian because if I put for the probability of G want to be

456
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,830
因为G想要在某处分布的可能性，然后祝你好运
also what is Gaussian because if I put for the probability of G want to be

457
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,710
因为G想要在某处分布的可能性，然后祝你好运
for the probability of G want to be somewhere distribution then good luck

458
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
因为G想要在某处分布的可能性，然后祝你好运
somewhere distribution then good luck nothing is going to come to the Gaussian

459
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,600
高斯不会有任何结果，所以在这种情况下Z 1的P是高斯
somewhere distribution then good luck nothing is going to come to the Gaussian

460
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,730
高斯不会有任何结果，所以在这种情况下Z 1的P是高斯
nothing is going to come to the Gaussian ok so in this case P of Z 1 is Gaussian

461
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:21,740
高斯不会有任何结果，所以在这种情况下Z 1的P是高斯
ok so in this case P of Z 1 is Gaussian and again naught is the notation what

462
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,010
再一次没有符号是1 0表示在1 0中关心绕组是
ok so in this case P of Z 1 is Gaussian and again naught is the notation what

463
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,550
再一次没有符号是1 0表示在1 0中关心绕组是
and again naught is the notation what this 1 0 means care in 1 0 winding is a

464
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:27,560
再一次没有符号是1 0表示在1 0中关心绕组是
this 1 0 means care in 1 0 winding is a 0 there in this expression based on our

465
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,150
根据我们的旋转，该表达式中的0
this 1 0 means care in 1 0 winding is a 0 there in this expression based on our

466
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,760
根据我们的旋转，该表达式中的0
0 there in this expression based on our rotation

467
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,470
所以离开了派-以前是什么，这是我们的开始
0 there in this expression based on our rotation

468
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480
所以离开了派-以前是什么，这是我们的开始


469
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,659
所以离开了派-以前是什么，这是我们的开始
so left the pie - what's the previous this is what we start with

470
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:41,669
所以离开了派-以前是什么，这是我们的开始
this is what we start with what's the prior was there the Buddhist

471
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:46,929
先验是什么，佛教徒还好吗，所以那里是零
this is what we start with what's the prior was there the Buddhist

472
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:50,150
先验是什么，佛教徒还好吗，所以那里是零
what's the prior was there the Buddhist okay all right so there's a zero there

473
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
先验是什么，佛教徒还好吗，所以那里是零
okay all right so there's a zero there okay and if your same basically but you

474
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,019
好吧，如果您基本上也一样，但您实际上没有任何信息
okay all right so there's a zero there okay and if your same basically but you

475
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,759
好吧，如果您基本上也一样，但您实际上没有任何信息
okay and if your same basically but you don't really have any information for

476
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:55,769
好吧，如果您基本上也一样，但您实际上没有任何信息
don't really have any information for the location of the missile to start

477
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:57,799
在收集任何数据之前，首先从导弹的位置开始
don't really have any information for the location of the missile to start

478
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,809
在收集任何数据之前，首先从导弹的位置开始
the location of the missile to start with right before you collect any data

479
00:15:59,809 --> 00:15:59,819
在收集任何数据之前，首先从导弹的位置开始
with right before you collect any data you can assume that this is sort of an

480
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:04,639
您可以假设这是无限的，如果您喜欢
with right before you collect any data you can assume that this is sort of an

481
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,629
您可以假设这是无限的，如果您喜欢
you can assume that this is sort of an infinite if you like volumes from

482
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
您可以假设这是无限的，如果您喜欢
infinite if you like volumes from basically the Sun can be anywhere so

483
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,059
基本上太阳可以在任何地方，所以只是给您一些预览结果
infinite if you like volumes from basically the Sun can be anywhere so

484
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:18,019
基本上太阳可以在任何地方，所以只是给您一些预览结果
basically the Sun can be anywhere so just to give you some preview results

485
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:18,029
基本上太阳可以在任何地方，所以只是给您一些预览结果
just to give you some preview results and again you may want to go actually

486
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:21,909
再一次，您可能想去实际上这是一项家庭作业，你们必须
just to give you some preview results and again you may want to go actually

487
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:24,530
再一次，您可能想去实际上这是一项家庭作业，你们必须
and again you may want to go actually this is a homework and you guys have to

488
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:24,540
再一次，您可能想去实际上这是一项家庭作业，你们必须
this is a homework and you guys have to extract this and program it you may want

489
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,960
提取并编程，您可能想实际运行这个简单的示例
this is a homework and you guys have to extract this and program it you may want

490
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,299
提取并编程，您可能想实际运行这个简单的示例
extract this and program it you may want to actually run this trivial examples

491
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:29,309
提取并编程，您可能想实际运行这个简单的示例
to actually run this trivial examples from math is toolbox we take exactly

492
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:33,319
从数学工具箱开始，我们花了整整五秒钟的时间来查看程序，
to actually run this trivial examples from math is toolbox we take exactly

493
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:35,809
从数学工具箱开始，我们花了整整五秒钟的时间来查看程序，
from math is toolbox we take exactly five seconds to look at the program and

494
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:35,819
从数学工具箱开始，我们花了整整五秒钟的时间来查看程序，
five seconds to look at the program and see five lines you can actually

495
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:39,049
看到五行您可以实际实现我们将要讨论的方程式
five seconds to look at the program and see five lines you can actually

496
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:42,229
看到五行您可以实际实现我们将要讨论的方程式
see five lines you can actually implement the equations we will discuss

497
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:42,239
看到五行您可以实际实现我们将要讨论的方程式
implement the equations we will discuss today so the problem is basically

498
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,729
今天，这个问题基本上是在弄清我们误会的一部分
implement the equations we will discuss today so the problem is basically

499
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:48,919
今天，这个问题基本上是在弄清我们误会的一部分
today so the problem is basically figuring out the part of a mistrial we

500
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:48,929
今天，这个问题基本上是在弄清我们误会的一部分
figuring out the part of a mistrial we have some knowledge of salvations which

501
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:50,509
有一些救赎的知识，这是绿色的圈子，好吧，这是
figuring out the part of a mistrial we have some knowledge of salvations which

502
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,449
有一些救赎的知识，这是绿色的圈子，好吧，这是
have some knowledge of salvations which are this green circles all right this is

503
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:53,459
有一些救赎的知识，这是绿色的圈子，好吧，这是
are this green circles all right this is the true path so it's more or less you

504
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,849
真实路径，所以或多或少您知道y的直线路径等于
are this green circles all right this is the true path so it's more or less you

505
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,970
真实路径，所以或多或少您知道y的直线路径等于
the true path so it's more or less you know the straight path in for y equal to

506
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:58,980
真实路径，所以或多或少您知道y的直线路径等于
know the straight path in for y equal to ten but you try to estimate this from

507
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,090
十个，但是您尝试从这种嘈杂的测量中估算出这个，所以这是
know the straight path in for y equal to ten but you try to estimate this from

508
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,870
十个，但是您尝试从这种嘈杂的测量中估算出这个，所以这是
ten but you try to estimate this from this noisy measurement so this is this

509
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:05,880
十个，但是您尝试从这种嘈杂的测量中估算出这个，所以这是
this noisy measurement so this is this little process you see are basically the

510
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,659
您看到的很少的过程基本上是此过滤分布的结果
this noisy measurement so this is this little process you see are basically the

511
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:10,579
您看到的很少的过程基本上是此过滤分布的结果
little process you see are basically the results of this filtering distribution

512
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:10,589
您看到的很少的过程基本上是此过滤分布的结果
results of this filtering distribution okay so it looks knology actually if you

513
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:15,829
好吧，所以如果您看着它，它实际上看起来像术
results of this filtering distribution okay so it looks knology actually if you

514
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,090
好吧，所以如果您看着它，它实际上看起来像术
okay so it looks knology actually if you look at you know it goes up and down

515
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:17,100
好吧，所以如果您看着它，它实际上看起来像术
look at you know it goes up and down etcetera this is way more smooth there

516
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,519
etcetera这是更平滑的方式，因此当您明显地注意到时，
look at you know it goes up and down etcetera this is way more smooth there

517
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,639
etcetera这是更平滑的方式，因此当您明显地注意到时，
etcetera this is way more smooth there so an obviously you notice when you

518
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:22,649
etcetera这是更平滑的方式，因此当您明显地注意到时，
so an obviously you notice when you start because you don't have any data

519
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:24,439
开始是因为您没有任何数据，您知道您基本上依赖于先验数据
so an obviously you notice when you start because you don't have any data

520
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,730
开始是因为您没有任何数据，您知道您基本上依赖于先验数据
start because you don't have any data you know you rely on the prior basically

521
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:28,740
开始是因为您没有任何数据，您知道您基本上依赖于先验数据
you know you rely on the prior basically the first step you're a little bit away

522
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,379
第一步，您要远离井壁，这就是您应该做的
you know you rely on the prior basically the first step you're a little bit away

523
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:32,779
第一步，您要远离井壁，这就是您应该做的
the first step you're a little bit away from well this is what you supposed to

524
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:32,789
第一步，您要远离井壁，这就是您应该做的
from well this is what you supposed to be but it picks up quite fast okay so

525
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:35,720
可以，但是很快就可以了，所以这是
from well this is what you supposed to be but it picks up quite fast okay so

526
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,490
可以，但是很快就可以了，所以这是
be but it picks up quite fast okay so this is the filtering distributions of

527
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:37,500
可以，但是很快就可以了，所以这是
this is the filtering distributions of sq if you assume that the data come

528
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,500
sq，如果您假设数据来自某一时间，则可以更新该住宿
this is the filtering distributions of sq if you assume that the data come

529
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,440
sq，如果您假设数据来自某一时间，则可以更新该住宿
sq if you assume that the data come one of the time you can update that stay

530
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,450
sq，如果您假设数据来自某一时间，则可以更新该住宿
one of the time you can update that stay for the Messiah list and and this is

531
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,240
弥赛亚的名单，这就是他所穿过的城市
one of the time you can update that stay for the Messiah list and and this is

532
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,050
弥赛亚的名单，这就是他所穿过的城市
for the Messiah list and and this is with the cities this crosses there if he

533
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:50,060
弥赛亚的名单，这就是他所穿过的城市
with the cities this crosses there if he does more thing actually you get very

534
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,990
实际上可以做更多的事情，所以您得到很好的结果，所以这是假设图片
with the cities this crosses there if he does more thing actually you get very

535
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,750
实际上可以做更多的事情，所以您得到很好的结果，所以这是假设图片
does more thing actually you get very nice results so this is assuming picture

536
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760
实际上可以做更多的事情，所以您得到很好的结果，所以这是假设图片
nice results so this is assuming picture of the swapping you know and you can

537
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,370
你知道的交换，你可以没有，你知道没有
nice results so this is assuming picture of the swapping you know and you can

538
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,280
你知道的交换，你可以没有，你知道没有
of the swapping you know and you can there is no you know there's no

539
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,290
你知道的交换，你可以没有，你知道没有
there is no you know there's no salacious basically the results they

540
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,690
淫荡的基本上他们看起来不错的结果
there is no you know there's no salacious basically the results they

541
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,890
淫荡的基本上他们看起来不错的结果
salacious basically the results they look pretty good

542
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:05,900
淫荡的基本上他们看起来不错的结果
look pretty good okay so that's you know what if we call

543
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,640
好吧，那就是您知道，如果我们进一步称呼您，那您基本上就是
look pretty good okay so that's you know what if we call

544
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,020
好吧，那就是您知道，如果我们进一步称呼您，那您基本上就是
okay so that's you know what if we call this more think you are basically

545
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,030
好吧，那就是您知道，如果我们进一步称呼您，那您基本上就是
this more think you are basically stabilizing the problem by using nope

546
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,270
通过使用除Twitter以外的任何当前数据来稳定问题
this more think you are basically stabilizing the problem by using nope

547
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,280
通过使用除Twitter以外的任何当前数据来稳定问题
stabilizing the problem by using nope any current data but Twitter

548
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:15,290
通过使用除Twitter以外的任何当前数据来稳定问题
any current data but Twitter observationally as well so this is this

549
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,700
观察上也是如此，这是吸烟分布，所以让我
any current data but Twitter observationally as well so this is this

550
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:24,520
观察上也是如此，这是吸烟分布，所以让我
observationally as well so this is this is the smoking distribution so let me

551
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:24,530
观察上也是如此，这是吸烟分布，所以让我
is the smoking distribution so let me discuss about this robotic slump problem

552
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,730
讨论这个机器人坍塌问题，这是一个标准问题，还有一个
is the smoking distribution so let me discuss about this robotic slump problem

553
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,000
讨论这个机器人坍塌问题，这是一个标准问题，还有一个
discuss about this robotic slump problem it's a standard problem and there's a

554
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,010
讨论这个机器人坍塌问题，这是一个标准问题，还有一个
it's a standard problem and there's a whole book actually on the subject area

555
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,680
如果我问是的话，整本书实际上是针对那些感兴趣的人的
it's a standard problem and there's a whole book actually on the subject area

556
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,590
如果我问是的话，整本书实际上是针对那些感兴趣的人的
whole book actually on the subject area for those interested again if I asked is

557
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:35,600
如果我问是的话，整本书实际上是针对那些感兴趣的人的
for those interested again if I asked is anybody doing any project from this I

558
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,330
任何人从此做任何项目，我都知道答案是否定的，所以让我定义一下
for those interested again if I asked is anybody doing any project from this I

559
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,940
任何人从此做任何项目，我都知道答案是否定的，所以让我定义一下
anybody doing any project from this I know the answer is no so let me define

560
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:39,950
任何人从此做任何项目，我都知道答案是否定的，所以让我定义一下
know the answer is no so let me define the project for you so I put these

561
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,060
该项目适合您，所以我把这些东西都整理好了，实际上让我使用
know the answer is no so let me define the project for you so I put these

562
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,180
该项目适合您，所以我把这些东西都整理好了，实际上让我使用
the project for you so I put these things all up well actually let me use

563
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:46,190
该项目适合您，所以我把这些东西都整理好了，实际上让我使用
things all up well actually let me use this picture I'm gonna go backwards okay

564
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,950
这张照片我要向后退，所以向右移动它可以执行任何操作
things all up well actually let me use this picture I'm gonna go backwards okay

565
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:56,890
这张照片我要向后退，所以向右移动它可以执行任何操作
this picture I'm gonna go backwards okay so that is moving right it does whatever

566
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:56,900
这张照片我要向后退，所以向右移动它可以执行任何操作
so that is moving right it does whatever tasks you have assigned to do it but it

567
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,800
您已指定要执行的任务，但它会尝试识别带来的位置
so that is moving right it does whatever tasks you have assigned to do it but it

568
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,530
您已指定要执行的任务，但它会尝试识别带来的位置
tasks you have assigned to do it but it tries to identify brought location is at

569
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:02,540
您已指定要执行的任务，但它会尝试识别带来的位置
tries to identify brought location is at this time and we denote this location as

570
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,350
这次，我们将此位置表示为X，好了，您必须放置一些
tries to identify brought location is at this time and we denote this location as

571
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:14,470
这次，我们将此位置表示为X，好了，您必须放置一些
this time and we denote this location as X okay abigai ting you have to put some

572
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
这次，我们将此位置表示为X，好了，您必须放置一些
X okay abigai ting you have to put some markings and say there's a role player

573
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,010
标记并说有一个角色扮演者Subic是您不认识的角色
X okay abigai ting you have to put some markings and say there's a role player

574
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,630
标记并说有一个角色扮演者Subic是您不认识的角色
markings and say there's a role player Subic is that don't work roles you know

575
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:19,640
标记并说有一个角色扮演者Subic是您不认识的角色
Subic is that don't work roles you know a little student very I mean you need to

576
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,690
一个小学生，我的意思是你需要像看到这个标记时间一样得到一些
Subic is that don't work roles you know a little student very I mean you need to

577
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,310
一个小学生，我的意思是你需要像看到这个标记时间一样得到一些
a little student very I mean you need to get some like you see this marking time

578
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,320
一个小学生，我的意思是你需要像看到这个标记时间一样得到一些
get some like you see this marking time this capital else okay

579
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,920
这个首都还可以，所以从字面上看，这就是这么少
get some like you see this marking time this capital else okay

580
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,680
这个首都还可以，所以从字面上看，这就是这么少
this capital else okay so literally that's how this little

581
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:29,690
这个首都还可以，所以从字面上看，这就是这么少
so literally that's how this little robots that captain last work right we

582
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,110
负责最后工作的机器人，我们在您的院子里提供一些市场，
so literally that's how this little robots that captain last work right we

583
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,590
负责最后工作的机器人，我们在您的院子里提供一些市场，
robots that captain last work right we provide some markets in in your yard and

584
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,600
负责最后工作的机器人，我们在您的院子里提供一些市场，
provide some markets in in your yard and there are more basically learns what it

585
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,690
有更多的基本了解它是什么，它需要去哪里
provide some markets in in your yard and there are more basically learns what it

586
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,770
有更多的基本了解它是什么，它需要去哪里
there are more basically learns what it is and where it needs to go

587
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:40,780
有更多的基本了解它是什么，它需要去哪里
is and where it needs to go to navigate through the space so this

588
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,540
在空间中导航，因此这标志着这个长而适中的大写字母L和一个
is and where it needs to go to navigate through the space so this

589
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,110
在空间中导航，因此这标志着这个长而适中的大写字母L和一个
to navigate through the space so this mark this long modest capital L and one

590
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,120
在空间中导航，因此这标志着这个长而适中的大写字母L和一个
mark this long modest capital L and one L till they're a fixed location okay and

591
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,160
L，直到它们固定到位，然后您提供它们，以便机器人尝试
mark this long modest capital L and one L till they're a fixed location okay and

592
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,010
L，直到它们固定到位，然后您提供它们，以便机器人尝试
L till they're a fixed location okay and you provide them so the robot is trying

593
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,020
L，直到它们固定到位，然后您提供它们，以便机器人尝试
you provide them so the robot is trying to us to make quality satisfied by

594
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,740
让我们通过测量距此固定点的距离来使质量满意
you provide them so the robot is trying to us to make quality satisfied by

595
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,570
让我们通过测量距此固定点的距离来使质量满意
to us to make quality satisfied by measuring its distance from this fixed

596
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:57,580
让我们通过测量距此固定点的距离来使质量满意
measuring its distance from this fixed long box so basically this is where it

597
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,340
长盒子，所以基本上这是它在周围时正确的位置
measuring its distance from this fixed long box so basically this is where it

598
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,620
长盒子，所以基本上这是它在周围时正确的位置
long box so basically this is where it is right when it's around makes this

599
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:04,630
长盒子，所以基本上这是它在周围时正确的位置
is right when it's around makes this realm want me to get elected this so in

600
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,620
领域希望我在这种情况下被选举为例，例如是一个时间
is right when it's around makes this realm want me to get elected this so in

601
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,930
领域希望我在这种情况下被选举为例，例如是一个时间
realm want me to get elected this so in this case for example a time one it's

602
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:09,940
领域希望我在这种情况下被选举为例，例如是一个时间
this case for example a time one it's just love mark one and one mark let's

603
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,770
只是爱标记一个和一个标记，让我们一直说到
this case for example a time one it's just love mark one and one mark let's

604
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,380
只是爱标记一个和一个标记，让我们一直说到
just love mark one and one mark let's say to all the time to which this from

605
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:16,390
只是爱标记一个和一个标记，让我们一直说到
say to all the time to which this from the M 2 and x 3 l1 etc okay so the

606
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:21,720
M 2和x 3 l1等等，所以使用这些位置估计位置
say to all the time to which this from the M 2 and x 3 l1 etc okay so the

607
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,870

620
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,760
2不是有条件独立的，因为有证据可以证明
given the evidence can you see that so even though the landmarks of fixed right

621
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,180
即使固定权利的地标不是有条件独立的
given the evidence can you see that so even though the landmarks of fixed right

even though the landmarks of fixed right they are not conditionally independent

623
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:56,260
即使固定权利的地标不是有条件独立的
they are not conditionally independent given the evidence and can you

624
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,250
给定证据，你能不能说这就是他们会读的味道
they are not conditionally independent given the evidence and can you

625
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,050
给定证据，你能不能说这就是他们会读的味道

629
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:07,840
复活节让我掩盖一下让我把身体放在这里好所以为什么n 1
put my body here all right so why n 1 and M 2 are not what you can read it

630
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,920
和M 2不是在那里可以阅读的内容
put my body here all right so why n 1 and M 2 are not what you can read it

和M 2不是在那里可以阅读的内容
there so I don't help very much yl1 and help

633
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,620
因此，我对yl1并没有太大帮助，并且可以帮助您在手表方面保持独立
there so I don't help very much yl1 and help

634
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:20,390
因此，我对yl1并没有太大帮助，并且可以帮助您在手表方面保持独立
so I don't help very much yl1 and help you are not independent given the watch

635
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,950
您使用最大的球算法并查看此概率图形

00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:53,380
接球并遵循一些规则，状态是有一条连接和112的路径
state there is a path connecting and 112 - so don't have a cop collecting l1 and

650
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,190
-所以不要让警察在那里收集l1和l2好的鼻涕斑点
state there is a path connecting and 112 - so don't have a cop collecting l1 and

651
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:03,030
-所以不要让警察在那里收集l1和l2好的鼻涕斑点
- so don't have a cop collecting l1 and l2 okay right snot blob there

652
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:07,480
和我一起最好的解释离开的情况对，我们有两个原因
- so don't have a cop collecting l1 and l2 okay right snot blob there

653
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:07,490
和我一起最好的解释离开的情况对，我们有两个原因


654
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:15,100
和我一起最好的解释离开的情况对，我们有两个原因
with me the best the explained away situation right we have two causes all

655
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,110
和我一起最好的解释离开的情况对，我们有两个原因
situation right we have two causes all right that explain this all right so

656
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,250
正确地解释了这一点，所以实际上给定了内翻和1和X 1
situation right we have two causes all right that explain this all right so

657
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,020
正确地解释了这一点，所以实际上给定了内翻和1和X 1
right that explain this all right so actually given varus and 1 and X 1

658
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,070
独立好吧，这样球就可以有效地通过
right that explain this all right so actually given varus and 1 and X 1

659
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,080
独立好吧，这样球就可以有效地通过


660
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:29,769
独立好吧，这样球就可以有效地通过
independent okay so effectively the ball can go through

661
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:29,779
独立好吧，这样球就可以有效地通过
so effectively the ball can go through here can go through there can reach

662
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:31,539
这里可以经过那里可以到达那里，所以这使这个问题研究
so effectively the ball can go through here can go through there can reach

663
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:35,289
这里可以经过那里可以到达那里，所以这使这个问题研究
here can go through there can reach there so this makes this problem study

664
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:35,299
这里可以经过那里可以到达那里，所以这使这个问题研究
there so this makes this problem study more complicated so given why these

665
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:39,669
更加复杂，因此给出了为什么这些精灵不是条件独立的
there so this makes this problem study more complicated so given why these

666
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:42,990
更加复杂，因此给出了为什么这些精灵不是条件独立的
more complicated so given why these elves are not conditional independent

667
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,000
更加复杂，因此给出了为什么这些精灵不是条件独立的
elves are not conditional independent actually and when I'm gonna do this

668
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,190
实际上，当我要去做的时候，除非有人决定
elves are not conditional independent actually and when I'm gonna do this

669
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,350
实际上，当我要去做的时候，除非有人决定
actually and when I'm gonna do this unless someone decides or it has

670
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,360
实际上，当我要去做的时候，除非有人决定
unless someone decides or it has submitted a project from this an Isis

671
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,110
通过Isis提交了一个项目来实际处理并使用
unless someone decides or it has submitted a project from this an Isis

673
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:52,610
通过Isis提交了一个项目来实际处理并使用
ability to actually handle this and use linear Gaussian systems is to write the

674
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:56,880
线性高斯系统就是写声望很高的概率

675
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,649
线性高斯系统就是写声望很高的概率
linear Gaussian systems is to write the probability of the prestigious let's say

676
00:22:59,649 --> 00:22:59,659
线性高斯系统就是写声望很高的概率
probability of the prestigious let's say hotel not only given Y but assuming that

677
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:02,590
旅馆不仅给定了Y，而且假设您给了您，给定了X，因此
probability of the prestigious let's say hotel not only given Y but assuming that

678
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,799
旅馆不仅给定了Y，而且假设您给了您，给定了X，因此
hotel not only given Y but assuming that you given you are given X as well so

679
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:05,809
旅馆不仅给定了Y，而且假设您给了您，给定了X，因此
you given you are given X as well so then they become independent then you

680
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:07,750
然后它们就变得独立了，那么您就可以使用碳过滤和
you given you are given X as well so then they become independent then you

681
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,760
然后它们就变得独立了，那么您就可以使用碳过滤和
then they become independent then you can use ideas from carbon filtering and

682
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:09,770
然后它们就变得独立了，那么您就可以使用碳过滤和
can use ideas from carbon filtering and sort of part of filter methods to come

00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:15,730
过滤方法的一部分，可以提出一个非常简单的解决方案
up with a very easy solution of this okay I mean this is a little bit like a

686
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,620
好吧，我的意思是这有点像一个普通问题，可以处理，但是
up with a very easy solution of this okay I mean this is a little bit like a

687
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,409
好吧，我的意思是这有点像一个普通问题，可以处理，但是
okay I mean this is a little bit like a trivial problem right to handle but in

688
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:23,419
好吧，我的意思是这有点像一个普通问题，可以处理，但是

互相碰击，您知道这基本上是一个琐碎的实现
hitting each other you know this is basically a trivial what implemented

697
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:40,039
互相碰击，您知道这基本上是一个琐碎的实现
basically a trivial what implemented maybe 10-15 years ago and those who did

698
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:43,269
大概在10到15年前，那些实施了这些技术的人变得非常有钱
basically a trivial what implemented maybe 10-15 years ago and those who did

包括几年前我非常年轻的同事想要解决的问题
colleagues a few years ago to solve basically his one-man company to observe

704
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,269
基本上他的一个人的公司要遵守，所以你可以很简单
colleagues a few years ago to solve basically his one-man company to observe

705
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:59,350
基本上他的一个人的公司要遵守，所以你可以很简单
basically his one-man company to observe okay so you can these are very simple

706
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,360
基本上他的一个人的公司要遵守，所以你可以很简单
okay so you can these are very simple algorithms but simple thing to pay

707
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,980
算法，但是付钱却很简单，而复杂的东西却不付钱
okay so you can these are very simple algorithms but simple thing to pay

708
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,850
算法，但是付钱却很简单，而复杂的东西却不付钱
algorithms but simple thing to pay complicated things that don't pay

709
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:03,860
算法，但是付钱却很简单，而复杂的东西却不付钱
complicated things that don't pay because they're complicated and

710
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,150
因为它们很复杂，没关系，所以观察模型
complicated things that don't pay because they're complicated and

711
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:12,170
因为它们很复杂，没关系，所以观察模型
because they're complicated and right alright so the observation model

712
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:12,180
因为它们很复杂，没关系，所以观察模型
right alright so the observation model right is the probability of Y given Z

713
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,420
右边是给定Z的情况下Y的概率，因此该运动模型是
right alright so the observation model right is the probability of Y given Z

714
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:22,590
右边是给定Z的情况下Y的概率，因此该运动模型是
right is the probability of Y given Z right so this motion model is the

715
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:22,600
右边是给定Z的情况下Y的概率，因此该运动模型是
right so this motion model is the probability of X this two dynamics okay

716
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,960
X的概率这两个动力学还可以，所以这基本上就是这种过滤
right so this motion model is the probability of X this two dynamics okay

717
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,950
X的概率这两个动力学还可以，所以这基本上就是这种过滤
probability of X this two dynamics okay and so this is basically this filtering

718
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:31,960
X的概率这两个动力学还可以，所以这基本上就是这种过滤
and so this is basically this filtering distribution together with the other

719
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:37,020
与其他钢筋一起分布，因为这是二维的
and so this is basically this filtering distribution together with the other

720
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,000
与其他钢筋一起分布，因为这是二维的
distribution together with the other bars because this is a two dimensional

721
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,010
与其他钢筋一起分布，因为这是二维的
bars because this is a two dimensional problem right you get and and the you

722
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,780
您得到的问题权利，并且您知道溢出的分布是
bars because this is a two dimensional problem right you get and and the you

723
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,220
您得到的问题权利，并且您知道溢出的分布是
problem right you get and and the you know the spilling distribution is a

724
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:44,230
您得到的问题权利，并且您知道溢出的分布是
know the spilling distribution is a Gaussian so basically you can draw an

725
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,710
高斯，所以基本上你可以画一个椭圆
know the spilling distribution is a Gaussian so basically you can draw an

726
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,400
高斯，所以基本上你可以画一个椭圆
Gaussian so basically you can draw an ellipse

727
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:47,410
高斯，所以基本上你可以画一个椭圆
ellipse all right around the mean of this

728
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,730
完全围绕此过滤分布的均值，您会注意到
ellipse all right around the mean of this

729
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,470
完全围绕此过滤分布的均值，您会注意到
all right around the mean of this filtering distribution and you notice so

730
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:52,480
完全围绕此过滤分布的均值，您会注意到
filtering distribution and you notice so you start from one location for you know

731
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,870
您从一个位置开始，您知道自己在哪里，然后就不确定了
filtering distribution and you notice so you start from one location for you know

732
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,600
您从一个位置开始，您知道自己在哪里，然后就不确定了
you start from one location for you know where you are and then the uncertainty

733
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:57,610
您从一个位置开始，您知道自己在哪里，然后就不确定了
where you are and then the uncertainty actually grows but then as you come

734
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,910
确实在增长，但是当您接近我们所看到的东西时，
where you are and then the uncertainty actually grows but then as you come

735
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,560
确实在增长，但是当您接近我们所看到的东西时，

736
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:01,570
确实在增长，但是当您接近我们所看到的东西时，
closer to something that we have seen before the uncertainties reduced

737
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,960
如果您什至不采取措施，现在不确定性就会减少
closer to something that we have seen before the uncertainties reduced

738
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,970
如果您什至不采取措施，现在不确定性就会减少
before the uncertainties reduced now if you don't even approach on the

739
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:05,980
如果您什至不采取措施，现在不确定性就会减少
now if you don't even approach on the same power because you are ready you not

从字面上看十大好吧十对
literally ten large okay ten right

751
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,030
现在让我说一个计算权，因为这种引入
literally ten large okay ten right

752
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,040
现在让我说一个计算权，因为这种引入


753
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:35,490
现在让我说一个计算权，因为这种引入
now let me just say a computation right because this sort of introduces the

754
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:35,500
现在让我说一个计算权，因为这种引入
because this sort of introduces the ideas also of dynamic graphical models

755
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,310
动态图形模型的想法，我也不会，我们将在讨论之前
because this sort of introduces the ideas also of dynamic graphical models

756
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:43,080
动态图形模型的想法，我也不会，我们将在讨论之前
ideas also of dynamic graphical models that I donít we will discuss before the

757
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,090
动态图形模型的想法，我也不会，我们将在讨论之前
that I donít we will discuss before the end of the semester but so what

758
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,960
学期末，但是那让我回到这张照片好吗

so let me go back to this picture okay so you are measuring Y right and we try

761
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:53,850
因此您正在正确地测量Y，我们会尝试估算这个位置
so let me go back to this picture okay so you are measuring Y right and we try

instant so Ellen X is your state see here the two things together is a thing

767
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,530
这两个东西在一起是Z，然后尝试给定Y的所有层
instant so Ellen X is your state see here the two things together is a thing

768
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:16,830
这两个东西在一起是Z，然后尝试给定Y的所有层
here the two things together is a thing Z and you try the stratum given Y all

769
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:16,840
这两个东西在一起是Z，然后尝试给定Y的所有层
Z and you try the stratum given Y all right let some locations you know what

770
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,140
正确，让一些地点您知道那里有什么，您能告诉我如何
Z and you try the stratum given Y all right let some locations you know what

00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,760
正确，让一些地点您知道那里有什么，您能告诉我如何
right let some locations you know what there is you know can you tell me how

772
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:23,770
正确，让一些地点您知道那里有什么，您能告诉我如何
there is you know can you tell me how this diagram is going to involve with

773
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,410
该图将随着时间的推移而涉及，抱歉，您要做什么
there is you know can you tell me how this diagram is going to involve with

774
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,930
该图将随着时间的推移而涉及，抱歉，您要做什么
this diagram is going to involve with time sorry what do you thing is is going

775
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:27,940
该图将随着时间的推移而涉及，抱歉，您要做什么
time sorry what do you thing is is going to happen but you see L 1 and L 2 so

776
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:38,370
发生，但您看到了L 1和L 2，因此您的推论将涉及L 1和L 2
time sorry what do you thing is is going to happen but you see L 1 and L 2 so

777
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,260
发生，但您看到了L 1和L 2，因此您的推论将涉及L 1和L 2
to happen but you see L 1 and L 2 so your inference will involve L 1 and L 2

778
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:40,270
发生，但您看到了L 1和L 2，因此您的推论将涉及L 1和L 2
your inference will involve L 1 and L 2 then if you have some class the only

779
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,230
那么如果您有一些课程，您唯一看到的就是L以显示您的
your inference will involve L 1 and L 2 then if you have some class the only

780
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,390
那么如果您有一些课程，您唯一看到的就是L以显示您的
then if you have some class the only thing that you see is L to show your

781
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:45,400
那么如果您有一些课程，您唯一看到的就是L以显示您的
thing that you see is L to show your state will involve only and 2 down there

782
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,390
状态将只涉及2个，而那里将涉及1个您知道的等等
thing that you see is L to show your state will involve only and 2 down there

783
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,330
状态将只涉及2个，而那里将涉及1个您知道的等等
state will involve only and 2 down there it will involve and 1 you know etc etc

784
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:51,340
状态将只涉及2个，而那里将涉及1个您知道的等等
it will involve and 1 you know etc etc so what happens is you move what happens

785
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,200
所以发生的事情是您移动发生的事情，所以如果您认为自己很大
it will involve and 1 you know etc etc so what happens is you move what happens

786
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,450
所以发生的事情是您移动发生的事情，所以如果您认为自己很大
so what happens is you move what happens to so if you think that you a big

787
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:00,460
所以发生的事情是您移动发生的事情，所以如果您认为自己很大
to so if you think that you a big correlation matrix that connects all

788
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,250
将所有精灵和轴连接起来的相关矩阵
to so if you think that you a big correlation matrix that connects all

789
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,980
将所有精灵和轴连接起来的相关矩阵
correlation matrix that connects all your elves and your axis what can you

790
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:04,990
将所有精灵和轴连接起来的相关矩阵
your elves and your axis what can you tell me about that correlation matrix as

791
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,110
告诉我有关时间的关联矩阵，它是否不足
your elves and your axis what can you tell me about that correlation matrix as

792
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,230
告诉我有关时间的关联矩阵，它是否不足
tell me about that correlation matrix as given to anything in time is it short of

793
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,240
告诉我有关时间的关联矩阵，它是否不足
given to anything in time is it short of everything correlates with everything or

794
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,940
一切都与一切相关，或者当您移动时发生某些事情
given to anything in time is it short of everything correlates with everything or

795
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,180
一切都与一切相关，或者当您移动时发生某些事情
everything correlates with everything or something happens as you move in I mean

796
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,190
一切都与一切相关，或者当您移动时发生某些事情
something happens as you move in I mean you notice here again PI 1 and 1 and L 2

797
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,850
您会再次注意到PI 1和1以及L 2有时间到达此处L 1
something happens as you move in I mean you notice here again PI 1 and 1 and L 2

798
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,170
您会再次注意到PI 1和1以及L 2有时间到达此处L 1
you notice here again PI 1 and 1 and L 2 are there time to and to here then L 1

799
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:22,180
您会再次注意到PI 1和1以及L 2有时间到达此处L 1
are there time to and to here then L 1 so what can you tell me about the

800
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,590
那么您能告诉我关于您之间
are there time to and to here then L 1 so what can you tell me about the

801
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,240
那么您能告诉我关于您之间
so what can you tell me about the correlations that you have between the

802
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,250
那么您能告诉我关于您之间
correlations that you have between the tray the outs and the axis or even the

803
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,780
随手移动托盘和轴，甚至URL本身
correlations that you have between the tray the outs and the axis or even the

804
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,799
随手移动托盘和轴，甚至URL本身
tray the outs and the axis or even the URLs themselves as you move with

805
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:32,809
随手移动托盘和轴，甚至URL本身
URLs themselves as you move with are they changing

806
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:35,919
他们在改变吗
URLs themselves as you move with are they changing

807
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,670
你记得做得有点晚才是你做得很好的观察结果
URLs themselves as you move with are they changing

808
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:39,680
你记得做得有点晚才是你做得很好的观察结果


809
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:47,800
你记得做得有点晚才是你做得很好的观察结果
you remember that makes a little late it is the observations that you make well

810
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:47,810
你记得做得有点晚才是你做得很好的观察结果
is the observations that you make well sure you observe some pain that connects

811
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,900
确保您观察到一些疼痛，这些疼痛会连接到奇数标记，所以
is the observations that you make well sure you observe some pain that connects

812
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,000
确保您观察到一些疼痛，这些疼痛会连接到奇数标记，所以
sure you observe some pain that connects to the odd marks right so the

813
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,010
确保您观察到一些疼痛，这些疼痛会连接到奇数标记，所以
to the odd marks right so the correlation is very high you don't see a

814
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,730
相关性很高您看不到很多生活没有相关性
to the odd marks right so the correlation is very high you don't see a

815
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,470
相关性很高您看不到很多生活没有相关性
correlation is very high you don't see a lot of life there is no correlation

816
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:56,480
相关性很高您看不到很多生活没有相关性
lot of life there is no correlation whatsoever so you can think of the

817
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,050
无论如何，您都可以想到代表什么的动态饼干
lot of life there is no correlation whatsoever so you can think of the

818
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:02,320
无论如何，您都可以想到代表什么的动态饼干
whatsoever so you can think of the dynamical biscuit that represents what

819
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:02,330
无论如何，您都可以想到代表什么的动态饼干
dynamical biscuit that represents what you see here where the strength of the

820
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,310
您会在这里看到相关性的强度与女孩之间的关系
dynamical biscuit that represents what you see here where the strength of the

821
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,690
您会在这里看到相关性的强度与女孩之间的关系
you see here where the strength of the correlations moves with the girls

822
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:09,700
您会在这里看到相关性的强度与女孩之间的关系
correlations moves with the girls so it's time some things that they were

823
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,550
所以是时候将一些高度相关的事物变得不相关了
correlations moves with the girls so it's time some things that they were

824
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,610
所以是时候将一些高度相关的事物变得不相关了
so it's time some things that they were highly correlated become uncorrelated

825
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:14,620
所以是时候将一些高度相关的事物变得不相关了
highly correlated become uncorrelated writing they're basically significant

826
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,350
写他们基本上很重要，所以这基本上属于
highly correlated become uncorrelated writing they're basically significant

827
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:22,180
写他们基本上很重要，所以这基本上属于
writing they're basically significant okay so so this basically falls in the

828
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,190
写他们基本上很重要，所以这基本上属于
okay so so this basically falls in the category of a system that is it doesn't

829
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:25,840
它不随时间变化的系统类别，所以图在不断发展
okay so so this basically falls in the category of a system that is it doesn't

830
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
它不随时间变化的系统类别，所以图在不断发展
category of a system that is it doesn't in with time so graph that is evolving

831
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:27,770
它不随时间变化的系统类别，所以图在不断发展
in with time so graph that is evolving with tiring so if you want to read more

832
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,830
累了，所以如果您想阅读更多有关此的内容，我建议基本上阅读
in with time so graph that is evolving with tiring so if you want to read more

833
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,770
累了，所以如果您想阅读更多有关此的内容，我建议基本上阅读
with tiring so if you want to read more about this I recommend basically to read

834
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:32,780
累了，所以如果您想阅读更多有关此的内容，我建议基本上阅读
about this I recommend basically to read this book on probabilistic slump so

835
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:37,120
这本书是关于概率下滑的，所以在书中有关于可待因的参考
about this I recommend basically to read this book on probabilistic slump so

836
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,830
这本书是关于概率下滑的，所以在书中有关于可待因的参考
this book on probabilistic slump so there is a reference on codeine in the

837
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:38,840
这本书是关于概率下滑的，所以在书中有关于可待因的参考
there is a reference on codeine in the north of this crisis card on this topic

838
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,520
在此主题的危机卡以北
there is a reference on codeine in the north of this crisis card on this topic

839
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,500
这样您就可以知道这是相关矩阵的快照
there is a reference on codeine in the north of this crisis card on this topic

840
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:43,510
这样您就可以知道这是相关矩阵的快照


841
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:50,620
这样您就可以知道这是相关矩阵的快照
and so you can see you know this is sort of a snapshot of the correlation matrix

842
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:50,630
这样您就可以知道这是相关矩阵的快照
of a snapshot of the correlation matrix that you get for the printing

843
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,300
您可以获得印刷发行版，您会发现有很多
of a snapshot of the correlation matrix that you get for the printing

844
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,490
您可以获得印刷发行版，您会发现有很多
that you get for the printing distribution you can see there's lots of

845
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:54,500
您可以获得印刷发行版，您会发现有很多
distribution you can see there's lots of zeroes there all right

846
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,440
零，好吧，十六是部分，所以无论发生什么
distribution you can see there's lots of zeroes there all right

847
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,720
零，好吧，十六是部分，所以无论发生什么
zeroes there all right sixteen is parts so whatever happens

848
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:58,730
零，好吧，十六是部分，所以无论发生什么
sixteen is parts so whatever happens with lament mister calculus part sitting

849
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,810
哀叹先生演算部分坐在相关矩阵右边
sixteen is parts so whatever happens with lament mister calculus part sitting

850
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:08,350
哀叹先生演算部分坐在相关矩阵右边
with lament mister calculus part sitting on the correlation matrix right

851
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,870
显然，有了这个概念而变得富有的人
with lament mister calculus part sitting on the correlation matrix right

等于CT x ZT加上这里没有你，加上一些高斯噪声
linear observation model was that YT is equal to CT x ZT plus there was no you

976
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:15,669
等于CT x ZT加上这里没有你，加上一些高斯噪声
equal to CT x ZT plus there was no you here plus some Gaussian noise with this

977
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
等于CT x ZT加上这里没有你，加上一些高斯噪声
here plus some Gaussian noise with this barrier you remember there was a

978
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,219
你记得有一个对称的障碍，好吧，所以这是
here plus some Gaussian noise with this barrier you remember there was a

979
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:24,729
你记得有一个对称的障碍，好吧，所以这是
barrier you remember there was a symmetry okay so all right so so this is

980
00:33:24,729 --> 00:33:24,739
你记得有一个对称的障碍，好吧，所以这是
symmetry okay so all right so so this is observational basically right so the

981
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:27,700
观察基本上是正确的，所以观察顺序
symmetry okay so all right so so this is observational basically right so the

982
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,169
观察基本上是正确的，所以观察顺序
observational basically right so the observation order

983
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:30,179
观察基本上是正确的，所以观察顺序
observation order is a Gaussian okay and because this

984
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:34,100
是高斯的，因为这种噪声是高斯的，所以男性是st。次
observation order is a Gaussian okay and because this

985
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,580
是高斯的，因为这种噪声是高斯的，所以男性是st。次
is a Gaussian okay and because this noise is Gaussian the male is st. times

986
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:37,590
是高斯的，因为这种噪声是高斯的，所以男性是st。次
noise is Gaussian the male is st. times Z alright C times C and the variance is

987
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:41,869
Z好C乘C，方差是Sigma平方，所以看看我是什么
noise is Gaussian the male is st. times Z alright C times C and the variance is

988
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:48,859
Z好C乘C，方差是Sigma平方，所以看看我是什么
Z alright C times C and the variance is Sigma square and so to see what I'm

989
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:48,869
Z好C乘C，方差是Sigma平方，所以看看我是什么
Sigma square and so to see what I'm trying to do okay very specific case but

990
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:57,499
试图做的很好，非常具体的情况，但实际上可能会非常慷慨
Sigma square and so to see what I'm trying to do okay very specific case but

991
00:33:57,499 --> 00:33:59,840
试图做的很好，非常具体的情况，但实际上可能会非常慷慨
trying to do okay very specific case but actually can be very generous ya think

992
00:33:59,840 --> 00:33:59,850
试图做的很好，非常具体的情况，但实际上可能会非常慷慨
actually can be very generous ya think that somehow some parameters in the

993
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:03,680
在某种程度上回归模型中的一些参数还可以
actually can be very generous ya think that somehow some parameters in the

994
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:10,190
在某种程度上回归模型中的一些参数还可以
that somehow some parameters in the regression model okay

995
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:19,569
然后您想通过某种线性回归来计算参数
that somehow some parameters in the regression model okay

996
00:34:19,569 --> 00:34:19,579
然后您想通过某种线性回归来计算参数


997
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:24,589
然后您想通过某种线性回归来计算参数
and then you want sort of to compute the parameters in some linear regression

998
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:24,599
然后您想通过某种线性回归来计算参数
parameters in some linear regression problems that will allow you to compute

999
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,299
问题，可以让您计算任意X的Y，因此我们可以执行任何特定的操作
parameters in some linear regression problems that will allow you to compute

1000
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:29,960
问题，可以让您计算任意X的Y，因此我们可以执行任何特定的操作
problems that will allow you to compute Y for any X so we can do any specific

1001
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:29,970
问题，可以让您计算任意X的Y，因此我们可以执行任何特定的操作
Y for any X so we can do any specific okay think so if you want to compute the

1002
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:35,210
好吧，所以如果您要计算观测模型，将取决于
Y for any X so we can do any specific okay think so if you want to compute the

1003
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,879
好吧，所以如果您要计算观测模型，将取决于
okay think so if you want to compute the the observation model will depend on

1004
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:37,889
好吧，所以如果您要计算观测模型，将取决于
the observation model will depend on what the input is and so the C matrix

1005
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:41,270
输入是什么，所以我在这里采用的C矩阵是X转置所有
the observation model will depend on what the input is and so the C matrix

1006
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:46,669
输入是什么，所以我在这里采用的C矩阵是X转置所有
what the input is and so the C matrix that I take here is X transpose all

1007
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:46,679
输入是什么，所以我在这里采用的C矩阵是X转置所有
that I take here is X transpose all right so X 2 is Pacific you know what it

1008
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,399
对，所以X 2是Pacific，您知道它让您想起回归
that I take here is X transpose all right so X 2 is Pacific you know what it

1009
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:50,930
对，所以X 2是Pacific，您知道它让您想起回归
right so X 2 is Pacific you know what it reminds you think of the regression

1010
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:50,940
对，所以X 2是Pacific，您知道它让您想起回归
reminds you think of the regression model that is basically you know people

1011
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:56,000
基本上就是您知道人们转置x y4 v通常转置X的模型
reminds you think of the regression model that is basically you know people

1012
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,380
基本上就是您知道人们转置x y4 v通常转置X的模型
model that is basically you know people transpose x y4 v transpose X usually

1013
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:00,390
基本上就是您知道人们转置x y4 v通常转置X的模型
transpose x y4 v transpose X usually when you write regression models you

1014
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,849
当您编写回归模型时，您会想到y等于W转置X加上一些
transpose x y4 v transpose X usually when you write regression models you

1015
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,819
当您编写回归模型时，您会想到y等于W转置X加上一些
when you write regression models you think of y equal W transpose X plus some

1016
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:04,829
当您编写回归模型时，您会想到y等于W转置X加上一些
think of y equal W transpose X plus some noise so my darling is typically the

1017
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:09,680
噪音，所以我的宝贝通常是
think of y equal W transpose X plus some noise so my darling is typically the

1018
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,950
点在这里，但是为什么在线性系统的线性版本中
think of y equal W transpose X plus some noise so my darling is typically the

1019
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:11,960
点在这里，但是为什么在线性系统的线性版本中


1020
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:20,510
点在这里，但是为什么在线性系统的线性版本中
point is here right but why in the linear version in the linear system

1021
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:20,520
点在这里，但是为什么在线性系统的线性版本中
linear version in the linear system model is three times Z plus a Gaussian

1022
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,450
这个模型是Z的三倍加上高斯噪声，所以我将Z设为这个
linear version in the linear system model is three times Z plus a Gaussian

1023
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:28,700
这个模型是Z的三倍加上高斯噪声，所以我将Z设为这个
model is three times Z plus a Gaussian noise alright so I am taking Z this this

1024
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:28,710
这个模型是Z的三倍加上高斯噪声，所以我将Z设为这个
noise alright so I am taking Z this this way and now taking a state to the

1025
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,410
的方式，现在采取一个州去部门，但他们使
noise alright so I am taking Z this this way and now taking a state to the

1026
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,299
的方式，现在采取一个州去部门，但他们使
way and now taking a state to the departmental stripped out but they make

1027
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:32,309
的方式，现在采取一个州去部门，但他们使
departmental stripped out but they make them demonic this is what about

1028
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:36,230
他们恶魔这是怎么回事
departmental stripped out but they make them demonic this is what about

1029
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,470
我的对称系统X-帕里斯（Parris）是我的八岁，我的表情之所以这样说是因为
departmental stripped out but they make them demonic this is what about

1030
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:36,480
我的对称系统X-帕里斯（Parris）是我的八岁，我的表情之所以这样说是因为


1031
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,230
我的对称系统X-帕里斯（Parris）是我的八岁，我的表情之所以这样说是因为
my symmetric system X - Parris is my eight my expression is to say because

1032
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
我的对称系统X-帕里斯（Parris）是我的八岁，我的表情之所以这样说是因为
eight my expression is to say because I'm going shopping as melody okay okay

1033
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:51,980
我要在韵律线性回归模型中以旋律好吗去购物
eight my expression is to say because I'm going shopping as melody okay okay

1034
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:58,700
我要在韵律线性回归模型中以旋律好吗去购物
I'm going shopping as melody okay okay in the linear regression model in verse

1035
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:58,710
我要在韵律线性回归模型中以旋律好吗去购物
in the linear regression model in verse 4 let's say when the input is Malta it's

1036
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,589
4比方说，当输入是马耳他时，与尺寸无关
in the linear regression model in verse 4 let's say when the input is Malta it's

1037
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:02,270

not one bit about the dimensional problems right the external sports times

1039
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,800
问题正确的外部运动时间theta加上噪声Sigma平方，所以这是
not one bit about the dimensional problems right the external sports times

1040
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,700
问题正确的外部运动时间theta加上噪声Sigma平方，所以这是

1041
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:07,710
问题正确的外部运动时间theta加上噪声Sigma平方，所以这是
theta plus noise Sigma square so this is my observation model basically okay so

1042
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,310
我的观察模型基本上还可以，所以如果我知道输入，则响应取决于
theta plus noise Sigma square so this is my observation model basically okay so

00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:04,020
确切的答案取决于您之前使用的是
you use for prior it would be either your Emily or your map estimate so the

1220
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,130
您的艾米丽（Emily）或您的地图估计，所以这里的重点是正确的，您需要想象
you use for prior it would be either your Emily or your map estimate so the

00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,740
您的艾米丽（Emily）或您的地图估计，所以这里的重点是正确的，您需要想象
your Emily or your map estimate so the point here is right you need to imagine

1222
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:09,750
您的艾米丽（Emily）或您的地图估计，所以这里的重点是正确的，您需要想象
point here is right you need to imagine three and if you imagine that somehow

1223
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,920
第三，如果您以某种方式想像，您可以将某些东西转置为动态
point here is right you need to imagine three and if you imagine that somehow

1224
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,050
第三，如果您以某种方式想像，您可以将某些东西转置为动态
three and if you imagine that somehow you can transpose something to a dynamic

1225

you get an online learning my destination or Emily estimation that

1229
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,099
我的目的地或艾米丽（Emily）估计，这种愿景可以挺身而出
you get an online learning my destination or Emily estimation that

1230
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:26,710
我的目的地或艾米丽（Emily）估计，这种愿景可以挺身而出
my destination or Emily estimation that vision back sort of to stand up ideas of

1231
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:26,720
我的目的地或艾米丽（Emily）估计，这种愿景可以挺身而出
vision back sort of to stand up ideas of machine learning for the error drives

1232
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,870
错误的机器学习现在驱动参数中的更新，因此
vision back sort of to stand up ideas of machine learning for the error drives

1233
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:33,880
错误的机器学习现在驱动参数中的更新，因此
machine learning for the error drives the updates in the parameters now so

1234
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:33,890
错误的机器学习现在驱动参数中的更新，因此
the updates in the parameters now so that so this is what I was saying

1235
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,740
所以这就是我基本上要说的，然后才停下来
the updates in the parameters now so that so this is what I was saying

1236
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,570
所以这就是我基本上要说的，然后才停下来
that so this is what I was saying basically before I put the few stops to

1237
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:37,580
所以这就是我基本上要说的，然后才停下来
basically before I put the few stops to do this with some generic rate that you

1238
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,140
用一些您首先选择实用的通用速率来执行此操作
basically before I put the few stops to do this with some generic rate that you

1239
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,690
用一些您首先选择实用的通用速率来执行此操作
do this with some generic rate that you sort of first select with practical

1240
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:43,700
用一些您首先选择实用的通用速率来执行此操作
sort of first select with practical training you know justified different

1241
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,579
训练您知道合理的不同值，这就是所谓的列表
sort of first select with practical training you know justified different

1242
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:47,710

1243
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:47,720
训练您知道合理的不同值，这就是所谓的列表
values this is what is called the list mean squares algorithm all right so this

1244
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,760
均方算法很好，所以您必须迭代一次
values this is what is called the list mean squares algorithm all right so this

1245
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,560
均方算法很好，所以您必须迭代一次
mean squares algorithm all right so this you have to iterate one should last of

1246
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:53,570
均方算法很好，所以您必须迭代一次
you have to iterate one should last of the data sets to make it to convert the

你知道预测地震，所以我听起来像土木工程师，
sound like civil engineer right and things like that

1418
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,580
现在这样的事情现在必须在风速中
sound like civil engineer right and things like that

1419
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,730
现在这样的事情现在必须在风速中
things like that now during the wind speed right now must

1420
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:30,740
现在这样的事情现在必须在风速中
now during the wind speed right now must be relevant as well okay all right

1421
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:37,470
也是相关的，好吧，所以罐子有点更多
now during the wind speed right now must be relevant as well okay all right

1422
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:41,710
也是相关的，好吧，所以罐子有点更多
be relevant as well okay all right and so canister sort of any bit more

1423
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:41,720
也是相关的，好吧，所以罐子有点更多
and so canister sort of any bit more complicated graphical mode them who are

1424
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,770
复杂的图形模式他们是谁观察到的原因为何依赖于此

1433
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:05,350
您喜欢您的观察结果，例如，如果您考虑
exist you can control even the sphere if you like in in your observations so for

1434
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,930
您喜欢您的观察结果，例如，如果您考虑
you like in in your observations so for example if you if you take think of this

1435
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:07,940
您喜欢您的观察结果，例如，如果您考虑
example if you if you take think of this model as it is now right and take that

1436
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,030
现在就建立模型，并认为这里没有颠簸的动态，所以BT
example if you if you take think of this model as it is now right and take that

1437
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,820
现在就建立模型，并认为这里没有颠簸的动态，所以BT

1438
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:12,830
现在就建立模型，并认为这里没有颠簸的动态，所以BT
this no bumping dynamics here so BT minus 1 equal to BT so every time you

1439
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:16,810
负1等于BT，所以每次您计算时，它们都会带您
this no bumping dynamics here so BT minus 1 equal to BT so every time you

1440
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,940
负1等于BT，所以每次您计算时，它们都会带您

calculate they take you getting accustomed amount of me

1442
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:21,030
我已尝试将Chalmers用作我的惯用量

Chalmers you have be attempted to be before big so this B is going to come to

1445
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:27,070
如果大，所以这个B会成为火车的一部分
Chalmers you have be attempted to be before big so this B is going to come to

1446
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:30,160
如果大，所以这个B会成为火车的一部分
before big so this B is going to come to be is part of the train if you have in

1447
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:30,170
如果大，所以这个B会成为火车的一部分
be is part of the train if you have in the evolution of the observations so we

1448
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,710
观测值的演变，所以我们有一些线性趋势，再加上
be is part of the train if you have in the evolution of the observations so we

1449
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,720

1450
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:34,730
观测值的演变，所以我们有一些线性趋势，再加上
have sort of some linear trend plus noise around it okay so this can allows

1451
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:37,480
周围的噪音还可以，所以这可以让您轻松地
have sort of some linear trend plus noise around it okay so this can allows

1452
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,940
周围的噪音还可以，所以这可以让您轻松地
noise around it okay so this can allows you to very easily to actually more than

1453
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:41,950
周围的噪音还可以，所以这可以让您轻松地
you to very easily to actually more than you know where the behaviors you like of

1454
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:44,830
您知道动态数据的行为在哪里，并且您在这里看到该团伙

00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,380
确定性噪声掩盖的三种情况
the three cases where you play as to what is the deterministic noise obscures

1459
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:52,390
确定性噪声掩盖的三种情况
what is the deterministic noise obscures observations the system or more okay all

1460
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:57,640
观察系统或更正常，所以让我结束
what is the deterministic noise obscures observations the system or more okay all

1461
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,910
观察系统或更正常，所以让我结束
observations the system or more okay all right so let me I'm going to finish

1462
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:00,920
观察系统或更正常，所以让我结束
right so let me I'm going to finish because this is the most important

1463
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,700
因为这是最重要的问题
right so let me I'm going to finish because this is the most important

1464
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,130
因为这是最重要的问题
because this is the most important problem that in the context of

1465
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:06,140
因为这是最重要的问题
problem that in the context of statistical machine learning modeling

1466
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,080
统计机器学习建模，但这也是物理学的要求
problem that in the context of statistical machine learning modeling

1467
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,420
统计机器学习建模，但这也是物理学的要求
statistical machine learning modeling but also it comes a require in physics

1468
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:10,430
统计机器学习建模，但这也是物理学的要求
but also it comes a require in physics this is what's called the album of them

1469
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:12,520
这就是所谓的他们的专辑auto regressive autoregressive
but also it comes a require in physics this is what's called the album of them

1470
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,500
这就是所谓的他们的专辑auto regressive autoregressive
this is what's called the album of them the auto regressive autoregressive

1471
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:14,510
这就是所谓的他们的专辑auto regressive autoregressive
the auto regressive autoregressive moving average model you may have seen

1472
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:17,140
移动平均模型，您可能已经在不同的背景下看到过，所以
the auto regressive autoregressive moving average model you may have seen

1473
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:23,940
移动平均模型，您可能已经在不同的背景下看到过，所以
moving average model you may have seen it in different contexts so the

1474
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:23,950
移动平均模型，您可能已经在不同的背景下看到过，所以
it in different contexts so the excellent thing okay there's not here

1475
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:27,370
好极了，好吧，我只是在写，这里没有关于Z的观察
it in different contexts so the excellent thing okay there's not here

1476
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:29,470
好极了，好吧，我只是在写，这里没有关于Z的观察
excellent thing okay there's not here observations on Z right I'm just writing

1477
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:29,480
好极了，好吧，我只是在写，这里没有关于Z的观察
observations on Z right I'm just writing this model like that and it's happy

1478
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,750
这样的模型，很高兴将其解释为什么状态
observations on Z right I'm just writing this model like that and it's happy

1479
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,640
这样的模型，很高兴将其解释为什么状态
this model like that and it's happy to interpret it as to what is the state

1480
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:33,650
这样的模型，很高兴将其解释为什么状态
to interpret it as to what is the state what you observe and things like that so

1481
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:35,620
你观察到的东西以及类似的东西，所以实际上在这里取决于这个P
to interpret it as to what is the state what you observe and things like that so

1482
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:41,320
你观察到的东西以及类似的东西，所以实际上在这里取决于这个P
what you observe and things like that so actually here depends on this P previous

1483
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:41,330
你观察到的东西以及类似的东西，所以实际上在这里取决于这个P
actually here depends on this P previous values of X T XT minus 1 to X 3 minus P

1484
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:45,760
XT XT减去1到X 3减去P的值，但也取决于此参数W
actually here depends on this P previous values of X T XT minus 1 to X 3 minus P

1485
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,030
XT XT减去1到X 3减去P的值，但也取决于此参数W
values of X T XT minus 1 to X 3 minus P but also depends on this parameters W

1486
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:48,040
XT XT减去1到X 3减去P的值，但也取决于此参数W
but also depends on this parameters W but you can tell them as T the very most

1487
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,070
但是您可以将它们最多说成T，所以从1到Q以及这个问题
but also depends on this parameters W but you can tell them as T the very most

1488
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:55,300
但是您可以将它们最多说成T，所以从1到Q以及这个问题
but you can tell them as T the very most so from 1 to Q and the question this

1489
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:55,310
但是您可以将它们最多说成T，所以从1到Q以及这个问题
so from 1 to Q and the question this think you can model this modeling

1490
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:59,800
认为您可以对此建模进行建模，因为您尝试对其进行建模可以告诉您如何
so from 1 to Q and the question this think you can model this modeling

1491
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,540
认为您可以对此建模进行建模，因为您尝试对其进行建模可以告诉您如何
think you can model this modeling because you try to shape it can tell how

1492
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:03,550
认为您可以对此建模进行建模，因为您尝试对其进行建模可以告诉您如何
because you try to shape it can tell how the exes correlate you know in firing

1493
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:07,930
您在发射树时所知道的exe相关，我们的寿命很短
because you try to shape it can tell how the exes correlate you know in firing

1494
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:10,450
您在发射树时所知道的exe相关，我们的寿命很短
the exes correlate you know in firing the tree we have short life correlations

1495
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:10,460
您在发射树时所知道的exe相关，我们的寿命很短
the tree we have short life correlations you know we have long term correlations

1496
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,460
你知道我们有长期的相关性，我们有模式，所以这一切都与
the tree we have short life correlations you know we have long term correlations

1497
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,190
你知道我们有长期的相关性，我们有模式，所以这一切都与
you know we have long term correlations we have mode and so this all about

1498
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:15,200
你知道我们有长期的相关性，我们有模式，所以这一切都与
we have mode and so this all about the shorter regressive moving average

1499
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,780
较短的回归移动平均模型允许您这样做
we have mode and so this all about the shorter regressive moving average

1500
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:20,830
较短的回归移动平均模型允许您这样做
the shorter regressive moving average model allows you to do that so for

1501
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:20,840
较短的回归移动平均模型允许您这样做
model allows you to do that so for example I'm taking the case here when T

1502
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,610
我在这里以T等于0的情况为例，因此该项不存在
model allows you to do that so for example I'm taking the case here when T

1503
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:26,590
我在这里以T等于0的情况为例，因此该项不存在
example I'm taking the case here when T is equal to 0 so this term is not there

1504
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:26,600
我在这里以T等于0的情况为例，因此该项不存在
is equal to 0 so this term is not there and take a proven case should be equal

1505
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,290
并采取一个经过证明的情况应立即等于1您可以看到，
is equal to 0 so this term is not there and take a proven case should be equal

1506
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,720
并采取一个经过证明的情况应立即等于1您可以看到，
and take a proven case should be equal to 1 immediately you can see that this

1507
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:31,730
并采取一个经过证明的情况应立即等于1您可以看到，
to 1 immediately you can see that this is the population model one so for

1508
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,990
是人口模型之一，因此治疗是您的第一个市政居民
to 1 immediately you can see that this is the population model one so for

1509
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,810
是人口模型之一，因此治疗是您的第一个市政居民
is the population model one so for treatment one is your first municipal

1510
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:37,820
是人口模型之一，因此治疗是您的第一个市政居民
treatment one is your first municipal chain right so one of the things we

1511
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:40,270
正确的链，所以我们在几周内就了解了马尔可夫链的一件事
treatment one is your first municipal chain right so one of the things we

1512
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:43,150
正确的链，所以我们在几周内就了解了马尔可夫链的一件事
chain right so one of the things we learned about Markov chains few weeks

1513
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:43,160
正确的链，所以我们在几周内就了解了马尔可夫链的一件事
learned about Markov chains few weeks ago basically you can model them to

1514
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,220
以前基本上，如果您选择P，就可以为他们建模以解决您的问题
learned about Markov chains few weeks ago basically you can model them to

1515
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,030
以前基本上，如果您选择P，就可以为他们建模以解决您的问题
ago basically you can model them to dissolve about you now if you take the P

1516
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:49,040
以前基本上，如果您选择P，就可以为他们建模以解决您的问题
dissolve about you now if you take the P to be equal to you know this time not to

1517
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,220
等于你知道这一次不存在，而你只有这个Q
dissolve about you now if you take the P to be equal to you know this time not to

1518
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,410
等于你知道这一次不存在，而你只有这个Q
to be equal to you know this time not to be there and you only have this Q

1519
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:53,420
等于你知道这一次不存在，而你只有这个Q
be there and you only have this Q they're basically the dependencies for Q

1520
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,260
他们基本上就是Q等于1的依存关系
be there and you only have this Q they're basically the dependencies for Q

1521
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,130
他们基本上就是Q等于1的依存关系
they're basically the dependencies for Q equal to 1

1522
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:57,140
他们基本上就是Q等于1的依存关系
equal to 1 they look like that alright so somehow

1523
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:01,180
它们看起来像这样，所以现在如果您引入碰撞，
equal to 1 they look like that alright so somehow

1524
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,150
它们看起来像这样，所以现在如果您引入碰撞，
they look like that alright so somehow now if you introduce collisions between

1525
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:04,160
它们看起来像这样，所以现在如果您引入碰撞，
now if you introduce collisions between the axis because they come from the

1526
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,800
轴，因为它们来自1xq取决于W 1 X 2的脊髓
now if you introduce collisions between the axis because they come from the

1527
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,850
轴，因为它们来自1xq取决于W 1 X 2的脊髓
the axis because they come from the spinal cord which 1xq depend on W 1 X 2

1528
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:12,860
轴，因为它们来自1xq取决于W 1 X 2的脊髓
spinal cord which 1xq depend on W 1 X 2 X 3 for gamma D 2 so here we have

1529
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,800
X 3代表伽玛D 2，所以在这里我们有短程相关
spinal cord which 1xq depend on W 1 X 2 X 3 for gamma D 2 so here we have

1530
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,310
X 3代表伽玛D 2，所以在这里我们有短程相关
X 3 for gamma D 2 so here we have short-range correlations okay so and

1531
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:18,320
X 3代表伽玛D 2，所以在这里我们有短程相关
short-range correlations okay so and again this is only for Q equal to 1 and

1532
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,970
同样，这仅适用于等于1的Q，如果您严格要求1和P 1至1
short-range correlations okay so and again this is only for Q equal to 1 and

1533
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:24,190
同样，这仅适用于等于1的Q，如果您严格要求1和P 1至1
again this is only for Q equal to 1 and if you just critical to 1 and P 1 to 1

1534
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:24,200
同样，这仅适用于等于1的Q，如果您严格要求1和P 1至1
if you just critical to 1 and P 1 to 1 you can get the provide least graphical

1535
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,260
您可以提供最少的图形化模型，如下所示：
if you just critical to 1 and P 1 to 1 you can get the provide least graphical

1536
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,690
您可以提供最少的图形化模型，如下所示：
you can get the provide least graphical models looks like this so it becomes

1537
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:28,700
您可以提供最少的图形化模型，如下所示：
models looks like this so it becomes basically correlations in time that are

1538
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,780
基本上都是时间上的相关性
models looks like this so it becomes basically correlations in time that are

1539
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:35,170
基本上都是时间上的相关性
basically correlations in time that are both both

1540
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:35,320
例如，您可以从我的前妻那里看到-取决于X 1，但是您应该
basically correlations in time that are both both

1541
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:35,330
例如，您可以从我的前妻那里看到-取决于X 1，但是您应该


1542
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:39,250
例如，您可以从我的前妻那里看到-取决于X 1，但是您应该
for example you can see here from my ex - depends on X 1 but then should you

1543
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:39,260
例如，您可以从我的前妻那里看到-取决于X 1，但是您应该
- depends on X 1 but then should you know that this connection is between W

1544
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,760
知道这种联系是在W之间，但您会得到额外的天然糖
- depends on X 1 but then should you know that this connection is between W

1545
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,800
知道这种联系是在W之间，但您会得到额外的天然糖
know that this connection is between W but you get extra sugar for natural

1546
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:44,810
知道这种联系是在W之间，但您会得到额外的天然糖
but you get extra sugar for natural correlation on on this model this is a

1547
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:49,000
在此模型上的相关性，如果您愿意，这是一个巨大的尝试领域
but you get extra sugar for natural correlation on on this model this is a

1548
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,380
在此模型上的相关性，如果您愿意，这是一个巨大的尝试领域
correlation on on this model this is a huge huge area for attempt if you if

1549
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:53,390
在此模型上的相关性，如果您愿意，这是一个巨大的尝试领域
huge huge area for attempt if you if your work has anything to do with

1550
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:54,850
您的工作与动态数据有关，那么这是一个主题领域
huge huge area for attempt if you if your work has anything to do with

1551
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:59,590
您的工作与动态数据有关，那么这是一个主题领域
your work has anything to do with dynamic data then this is a subject area

1552
00:53:59,590 --> 00:53:59,600
您的工作与动态数据有关，那么这是一个主题领域
dynamic data then this is a subject area on its own people do PhD theses actually

1553
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,530
在自己的人身上就这个话题做博士学位论文，好吧，所以不要
dynamic data then this is a subject area on its own people do PhD theses actually

1554
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,770
在自己的人身上就这个话题做博士学位论文，好吧，所以不要
on its own people do PhD theses actually on this on this topic okay so don't

1555
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:05,780
在自己的人身上就这个话题做博士学位论文，好吧，所以不要
on this on this topic okay so don't consider central quad because this looks

1556
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,290
考虑中央四边形，因为这看起来很简单，仅适用于演讲
on this on this topic okay so don't consider central quad because this looks

1557
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,960
考虑中央四边形，因为这看起来很简单，仅适用于演讲
consider central quad because this looks simple are only for a lecture all right

1558
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:10,970
考虑中央四边形，因为这看起来很简单，仅适用于演讲
simple are only for a lecture all right simple things you know what it means

1559
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:12,670
简单的事情，你知道这意味着什么都可以点击，如果
simple are only for a lecture all right simple things you know what it means

1560
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:15,310
简单的事情，你知道这意味着什么都可以点击，如果
simple things you know what it means there are clickable everywhere and if

1561
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:15,320
简单的事情，你知道这意味着什么都可以点击，如果
there are clickable everywhere and if there are people everywhere there are

1562
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,050
到处都有人，影响是巨大的，每个人都在乎
there are clickable everywhere and if there are people everywhere there are

1563
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:19,960
到处都有人，影响是巨大的，每个人都在乎
there are people everywhere there are impact is enormous and everybody cares

1564
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:19,970
到处都有人，影响是巨大的，每个人都在乎
impact is enormous and everybody cares about what you do okay if you have any

1565
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:26,830
如果您对工程学有任何了解，可以做些什么
impact is enormous and everybody cares about what you do okay if you have any

1566
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,680
如果您对工程学有任何了解，可以做些什么
about what you do okay if you have any on the wings you know with engineering

1567
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:29,690
如果您对工程学有任何了解，可以做些什么
on the wings you know with engineering then basically as they say as the strong

1568
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:33,040
然后基本上就像他们说的那样，明智的选择是顺风行事，所以
on the wings you know with engineering then basically as they say as the strong

1569
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,280
然后基本上就像他们说的那样，明智的选择是顺风行事，所以
then basically as they say as the strong choice is going to the wind right ok so

1570
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:36,290
然后基本上就像他们说的那样，明智的选择是顺风行事，所以
choice is going to the wind right ok so here it is it's a little bit more

1571
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:39,040
这比这要复杂一点
choice is going to the wind right ok so here it is it's a little bit more

1572
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:39,910
这比这要复杂一点
here it is it's a little bit more complicated than that

1573
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:39,920
这比这要复杂一点
complicated than that ok so let's say we have 23 minutes so we

1574
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:45,700
好的，所以我们说我们有23分钟，所以我们有大约20分钟需要您
complicated than that ok so let's say we have 23 minutes so we

given my data BT minus 1 is a Gaussian with this mean of the variance

1869
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:20,730
与方差的平均值很好，所以我们现在如何计算

1870
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:20,740
与方差的平均值很好，所以我们现在如何计算
nicely so how do we compute now the probability how do we compute actually

1871
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:23,160
概率，我们如何实际计算过滤分布，如果我

the posterior of CP this cable is rule ok so I split my evidence from 1 to t 2

1877
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:37,710
好的，所以我将证据从1分解为t 2将证据从1分解为t减去1，然后我把
the posterior of CP this cable is rule ok so I split my evidence from 1 to t 2

1878
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:40,710
好的，所以我将证据从1分解为t 2将证据从1分解为t减去1，然后我把

像这样分开，然后我喜欢这个比例，你知道
like this separately and then I like this proportional that the you know the

1882
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:46,559
像这样分开，然后我喜欢这个比例，你知道
this proportional that the you know the denominator is unimportant

1883
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,390
分母并不重要，因为CT，我喜欢YP，所以
this proportional that the you know the denominator is unimportant

1884
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:51,510
分母并不重要，因为CT，我喜欢YP，所以

now applications this for questions that I cut and pasted from the lien Gaussian

2105
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:43,280
现在将其应用于我从留置高斯剪切和粘贴的问题
I cut and pasted from the lien Gaussian system they don't look like the camera

2106
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,919
系统看起来不像相机过滤掉他们看到的问题
I cut and pasted from the lien Gaussian system they don't look like the camera

2107
01:12:44,919 --> 01:12:46,870
系统看起来不像相机过滤掉他们看到的问题
system they don't look like the camera filtering your questions that they saw

2108
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:46,880
系统看起来不像相机过滤掉他们看到的问题
filtering your questions that they saw with you in terms of this caring metrics

2109
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,600
在这个衡量指标上与您保持一致，所以问题是卡尔曼获得方法
filtering your questions that they saw with you in terms of this caring metrics

2110
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,300
在这个衡量指标上与您保持一致，所以问题是卡尔曼获得方法
with you in terms of this caring metrics so the question is ways the Kalman gain

2111
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:52,310
在这个衡量指标上与您保持一致，所以问题是卡尔曼获得方法
so the question is ways the Kalman gain metrics come strong because it's not

2112
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:55,090
指标变得很强大，因为它不存在，所以很明显，先生
so the question is ways the Kalman gain metrics come strong because it's not

2113
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:57,400
指标变得很强大，因为它不存在，所以很明显，先生
metrics come strong because it's not there alright so obviously the sir

2114
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:57,410
指标变得很强大，因为它不存在，所以很明显，先生
there alright so obviously the sir questions will not be very sort of

2115
01:12:57,410 --> 01:13:00,959
问题将不是一种有效的编程方式，因为我
there alright so obviously the sir questions will not be very sort of

2116
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:04,300
问题将不是一种有效的编程方式，因为我
questions will not be very sort of efficient way to program this because I

2117
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:04,310
问题将不是一种有效的编程方式，因为我
efficient way to program this because I see English eh if you want to probably

2118
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:06,790
如果您想使用协方差，则请参见英语eh，这意味着您要
efficient way to program this because I see English eh if you want to probably

2119
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:08,500
如果您想使用协方差，则请参见英语eh，这意味着您要
see English eh if you want to probably the covariance means you're going to

2120
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:08,510
如果您想使用协方差，则请参见英语eh，这意味着您要
the covariance means you're going to have to calculate the inverse of this

2121
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:09,760
必须在这里计算这个巨大矩阵的逆，所以这不会
the covariance means you're going to have to calculate the inverse of this

2122
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,400
必须在这里计算这个巨大矩阵的逆，所以这不会
have to calculate the inverse of this huge matrix here okay so this will not

2123
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:12,410
必须在这里计算这个巨大矩阵的逆，所以这不会
huge matrix here okay so this will not be very good when smart way to do things

2124
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:14,800
聪明的做事方式时会很好，所以让我们看一下不同的术语
huge matrix here okay so this will not be very good when smart way to do things

2125
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,800
聪明的做事方式时会很好，所以让我们看一下不同的术语
be very good when smart way to do things so let's look at different terms

2126
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:17,810
聪明的做事方式时会很好，所以让我们看一下不同的术语
so let's look at different terms okay so I am cloning here the first

2127
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:23,410
好吧，所以我在这里克隆第一个方程式实际上可以在
so let's look at different terms okay so I am cloning here the first

2128
01:13:23,410 --> 01:13:26,530
好吧，所以我在这里克隆第一个方程式实际上可以在

01:13:42,469 --> 01:13:44,020
从视觉上看，我们看到的任何东西
Sigma T is actually given by this does it visually

2140
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,729
从视觉上看，我们看到的任何东西
it visually anything that we have seen like a few

2141
01:13:45,729 --> 01:13:45,739
从视觉上看，我们看到的任何东西
anything that we have seen like a few slides back the matrix inversion name

2142
01:13:45,739 --> 01:13:49,600
向后滑动矩阵求反名称是伍德伯里的身分，所以
anything that we have seen like a few slides back the matrix inversion name

2143
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,090
向后滑动矩阵求反名称是伍德伯里的身分，所以
slides back the matrix inversion name are the Woodbury identity okay so

2144
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:52,100
向后滑动矩阵求反名称是伍德伯里的身分，所以
are the Woodbury identity okay so basically to try to invert this

2145
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:53,890
基本上是试图扭转这种情况，基本上你会改变队长的页面
are the Woodbury identity okay so basically to try to invert this

2146
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:57,070
基本上是试图扭转这种情况，基本上你会改变队长的页面
basically to try to invert this basically you get captain page change of

2147
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:57,080
基本上是试图扭转这种情况，基本上你会改变队长的页面
basically you get captain page change of symbols you get this nice you know

2148
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:01,120
符号，你会得到很好的理解，你知道这里的方程式，如果你注意到了

2149
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:08,500
符号，你会得到很好的理解，你知道这里的方程式，如果你注意到了
symbols you get this nice you know equation here and if you noticed the

2150
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:08,510
符号，你会得到很好的理解，你知道这里的方程式，如果你注意到了
equation here and if you noticed the wrist okay there is a steep PT minus 1

2151
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:11,800
手腕好吧，PT的斜率是负1，所以这是
equation here and if you noticed the wrist okay there is a steep PT minus 1

2152
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,320
手腕好吧，PT的斜率是负1，所以这是

2153
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:14,330
手腕好吧，PT的斜率是负1，所以这是
so this is the covariance of the predictive one step ahead using date

2154
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:16,990
仅使用我们计算出的t减1的日期提前一个预测性的步骤
so this is the covariance of the predictive one step ahead using date

2155
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:19,419
仅使用我们计算出的t减1的日期提前一个预测性的步骤

01:14:19,419 --> 01:14:19,429
仅使用我们计算出的t减1的日期提前一个预测性的步骤
only of the t minus 1 we have computed that so I can put this outside and this

2157
01:14:19,429 --> 01:14:22,570
所以我可以把它放在外面和整个城市的矩阵中，对此我感到抱歉
only of the t minus 1 we have computed that so I can put this outside and this
