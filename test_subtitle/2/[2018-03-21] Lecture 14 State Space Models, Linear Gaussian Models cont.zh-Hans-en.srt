1
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:38,020
但我并没有等着其他人出现，我们需要启动这项法案51
but I was not waiting for anybody else to show up we need to start this bill 51

2
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,030
但我并没有等着其他人出现，我们需要启动这项法案51
to show up we need to start this bill 51 so I'm gonna try to finish state-space

3
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,390
所以今天我要尝试完成状态空间模型
to show up we need to start this bill 51 so I'm gonna try to finish state-space

4
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,960
所以今天我要尝试完成状态空间模型
so I'm gonna try to finish state-space models today there will be more things

5
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:44,970
所以今天我要尝试完成状态空间模型
models today there will be more things in where they are then unbelievers as

6
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,580
然后他们像他们所说的那样是不信的，而且还可以，所以我在哪里
models today there will be more things in where they are then unbelievers as

7
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:57,920
然后他们像他们所说的那样是不信的，而且还可以，所以我在哪里
in where they are then unbelievers as they say and more okay so where I was

8
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:57,930
然后他们像他们所说的那样是不信的，而且还可以，所以我在哪里
they say and more okay so where I was gonna say what we are trying to finish

9
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,500
要说些什么，我们要根据这些来完成状态，但是有很多
they say and more okay so where I was gonna say what we are trying to finish

10
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,570
要说些什么，我们要根据这些来完成状态，但是有很多
gonna say what we are trying to finish states based on those but there is lots

11
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:02,580
要说些什么，我们要根据这些来完成状态，但是有很多
states based on those but there is lots of stuff in the notes that I don't think

12
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,750
我认为我不会涵盖的笔记中的内容，这样您就不会得到
states based on those but there is lots of stuff in the notes that I don't think

13
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,140
我认为我不会涵盖的笔记中的内容，这样您就不会得到
of stuff in the notes that I don't think I will cover so that you don't get a

20
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:21,540
我们拥有的事物中蕴含的某种基本和某些方式
ways implied in in the things we have seen before I you know so last lecture

21
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,750
在我知道之前见过，所以上一讲我们衍生了历史问题的转折点
ways implied in in the things we have seen before I you know so last lecture

22
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,290
在我知道之前见过，所以上一讲我们衍生了历史问题的转折点
seen before I you know so last lecture we derived the turn of history questions

23
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:27,300
在我知道之前见过，所以上一讲我们衍生了历史问题的转折点
we derived the turn of history questions for linear dynamical systems from

25
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,470
对于从头开始的线性动力系统，基本上我们看了
for linear dynamical systems from scratch basically we looked at the

26
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:33,480
对于从头开始的线性动力系统，基本上我们看了
scratch basically we looked at the questions we said this this independence

27
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,290
问题，我们说这种独立的关系和概率玩
scratch basically we looked at the questions we said this this independence

question so what I want to do is I want to show you that in essence everything

33
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,210
告诉你，实质上，当我们
question so what I want to do is I want to show you that in essence everything

告诉你，实质上，当我们
to show you that in essence everything we learn about rest is passing when we

35
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
告诉你，实质上，当我们
we learn about rest is passing when we apply that to the other amical systems

36
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,550
将其应用于其他amical系统实际上将直接给我们
we learn about rest is passing when we apply that to the other amical systems

37

41
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:03,540
军事问题的颜色，也可以一概而论，所以我要
be generalized as well so I'm going to do this highlight basically some of the

42
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,949
这样做基本上突出了他们走的方式的某些推导，但事实并非如此
be generalized as well so I'm going to do this highlight basically some of the

44
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:09,900
这样做基本上突出了他们走的方式的某些推导，但事实并非如此
derivation the way they go they are not trivial so so in some sense you're doing

45
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,370
琐碎的，所以从某种意义上说，您正在使用主人通过的额外机场，但是

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,190
因数与已知来自总线的消息相同，因此
factor is the same as the message the previous from the bus is known so in

125
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:49,200
因数与已知来自总线的消息相同，因此
previous from the bus is known so in essence it emphasizes that we are just

126
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,840
本质上，它强调我们只为处理消息而感到高兴
previous from the bus is known so in essence it emphasizes that we are just

127
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,080
本质上，它强调我们只为处理消息而感到高兴
essence it emphasizes that we are just happy enough to only work with messages

128
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,090
本质上，它强调我们只为处理消息而感到高兴
happy enough to only work with messages from factors to know you don't need to

129
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,300
从各种因素中得知您不必为多方交易而烦恼
happy enough to only work with messages from factors to know you don't need to

130
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,930
从各种因素中得知您不必为多方交易而烦恼
from factors to know you don't need to bother progressing for multiparty all

131
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:02,940
从各种因素中得知您不必为多方交易而烦恼
bother progressing for multiparty all right so this is the common message

132
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,870
对，所以这是传递的常见消息，我们称其为Alpha
bother progressing for multiparty all right so this is the common message

133
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,230
对，所以这是传递的常见消息，我们称其为Alpha
right so this is the common message passing and we call this the alpha

134
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,240
对，所以这是传递的常见消息，我们称其为Alpha
passing and we call this the alpha message okay and we discuss sort of two

135
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,920
信息还可以，我们讨论了两种不同的符号，您知道一个
passing and we call this the alpha message okay and we discuss sort of two

136
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,630
信息还可以，我们讨论了两种不同的符号，您知道一个
message okay and we discuss sort of two different notations you know one that

137
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:16,640
信息还可以，我们讨论了两种不同的符号，您知道一个
different notations you know one that the message corresponding to this it was

138
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,090
给定所有数据，对应于此的消息是Zn的后验
different notations you know one that the message corresponding to this it was

139
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,610
给定所有数据，对应于此的消息是Zn的后验
the message corresponding to this it was the posterior of Zn given all the data

140
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:25,620
给定所有数据，对应于此的消息是Zn的后验
the posterior of Zn given all the data at the time and and I think another

141
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,540
当时，我认为另一种表示法是尼姑标准化后路
the posterior of Zn given all the data at the time and and I think another

142
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,390
当时，我认为另一种表示法是尼姑标准化后路
at the time and and I think another notation was a nun normalized posterior

143
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
当时，我认为另一种表示法是尼姑标准化后路
notation was a nun normalized posterior effectively so if you don't want to get

144
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,170
有效地，所以如果您不想与该表示法混淆
notation was a nun normalized posterior effectively so if you don't want to get

145
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,150
有效地，所以如果您不想与该表示法混淆
effectively so if you don't want to get confused with the notation effectively

146
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
有效地，所以如果您不想与该表示法混淆
confused with the notation effectively you can write that this is proportional

147
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,210
您可以说这与您在右侧看到的成正比
confused with the notation effectively you can write that this is proportional

148
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,160
您可以说这与您在右侧看到的成正比
you can write that this is proportional to what you see on the right-hand side

149
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,170
您可以说这与您在右侧看到的成正比
to what you see on the right-hand side so when you compute the right-hand side

150
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,500
因此，当您计算右侧时，可以对其进行归一化，
to what you see on the right-hand side so when you compute the right-hand side

151
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,230
因此，当您计算右侧时，可以对其进行归一化，
so when you compute the right-hand side then you normalize it and you get a

152
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
因此，当您计算右侧时，可以对其进行归一化，
then you normalize it and you get a distribution so one way or another

153
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,390
分布，所以如果您看到一种或另一种形式，这并不重要
then you normalize it and you get a distribution so one way or another

154
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,430
分布，所以如果您看到一种或另一种形式，这并不重要
distribution so one way or another it doesn't really matter if you see

155
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:52,440
分布，所以如果您看到一种或另一种形式，这并不重要
it doesn't really matter if you see different notations okay so this is the

156
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,130
可以使用不同的符号，所以这是转发消息，我也想展示一下
it doesn't really matter if you see different notations okay so this is the

157
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,650
可以使用不同的符号，所以这是转发消息，我也想展示一下
different notations okay so this is the forward messages and I also want to show

158
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:57,660
可以使用不同的符号，所以这是转发消息，我也想展示一下
forward messages and I also want to show you the same schematic basically the

159
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,320
您相同的示意图基本上是从根到无的反向消息
forward messages and I also want to show you the same schematic basically the

160
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,160
您相同的示意图基本上是从根到无的反向消息
you the same schematic basically the backward messages from the root to no

161
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,170
您相同的示意图基本上是从根到无的反向消息
backward messages from the root to no dates to the left so the message the

162
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,150
日期在左侧，因此消息传递的消息基本上是相同的
backward messages from the root to no dates to the left so the message the

163
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,100
日期在左侧，因此消息传递的消息基本上是相同的
dates to the left so the message the message passing is basically identical

164
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,110
日期在左侧，因此消息传递的消息基本上是相同的
message passing is basically identical to before the things but it goes

165
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,260
到事物之前，但它向后退，因此来自
message passing is basically identical to before the things but it goes

166
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,930
到事物之前，但它向后退，因此来自
to before the things but it goes backwards so the message from the

167
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:14,940
到事物之前，但它向后退，因此来自
backwards so the message from the factory and the little the masters from

168
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,730
工厂和来自n加一的小大师们注意结束
backwards so the message from the factory and the little the masters from

169
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:25,100
工厂和来自n加一的小大师们注意结束
factory and the little the masters from at n plus one to note the end alright so

170
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,110
工厂和来自n加一的小大师们注意结束
at n plus one to note the end alright so again we are making a messages from

171
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,570
再次，我们从实践到笔记都做了一条信息，所以这里的信息
at n plus one to note the end alright so again we are making a messages from

172
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,680
再次，我们从实践到笔记都做了一条信息，所以这里的信息
again we are making a messages from practice to notes so this message here

173
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:29,690
再次，我们从实践到笔记都做了一条信息，所以这里的信息
practice to notes so this message here okay

174
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,830
好的，这是因素吗
practice to notes so this message here okay

175
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,670
好的，这是因素吗
okay is this factor

176
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
好的，这是因素吗
is this factor why is the message without the factor of

177
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,010
为什么该消息没有十加二美分的因素才能记下ZL加一
is this factor why is the message without the factor of

178
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,500
为什么该消息没有十加二美分的因素才能记下ZL加一
why is the message without the factor of ten plus two cents to note ZL plus one

179
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:39,510
为什么该消息没有十加二美分的因素才能记下ZL加一
ten plus two cents to note ZL plus one which is this and obviously this message

180
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,820
就是这个，显然这个消息和那个业务是一样的，所以再说一次
ten plus two cents to note ZL plus one which is this and obviously this message

181
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,449
就是这个，显然这个消息和那个业务是一样的，所以再说一次
which is this and obviously this message the same as that business right so again

182
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:46,459
就是这个，显然这个消息和那个业务是一样的，所以再说一次
the same as that business right so again this message is this factor times this

183
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,970
这个消息是这个因子乘以这个消息，我们整合到n
the same as that business right so again this message is this factor times this

184
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,460
这个消息是这个因子乘以这个消息，我们整合到n
this message is this factor times this message where we integrate out to the n

185
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:52,470
这个消息是这个因子乘以这个消息，我们整合到n
message where we integrate out to the n plus one and obviously you can see that

186
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,980
再加上一个，显然您会看到这个过程是倒退的，因为我们
message where we integrate out to the n plus one and obviously you can see that

187
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,870
再加上一个，显然您会看到这个过程是倒退的，因为我们
plus one and obviously you can see that this process is backwards because we

188
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
再加上一个，显然您会看到这个过程是倒退的，因为我们
this process is backwards because we require this message to the right to

189
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,829
要求此消息在右边以计算其余部分在左边
this process is backwards because we require this message to the right to

190
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:02,930
要求此消息在右边以计算其余部分在左边
require this message to the right to compute the rest to the left and the

191
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:02,940
要求此消息在右边以计算其余部分在左边
compute the rest to the left and the integration is to the variables to the

192
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,139
积分在右边的变量中，在这种情况下为Zn加1
compute the rest to the left and the integration is to the variables to the

193
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:09,230
积分在右边的变量中，在这种情况下为Zn加1
integration is to the variables to the right which is in this case Zn plus 1

194
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:09,240
积分在右边的变量中，在这种情况下为Zn加1
right which is in this case Zn plus 1 and we call this the mega message okay

195
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,250
我们称其为“大消息”，所以较大的消息向后退
right which is in this case Zn plus 1 and we call this the mega message okay

196
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,079
我们称其为“大消息”，所以较大的消息向后退
and we call this the mega message okay so the bigger message go backwards the

197
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:15,089
我们称其为“大消息”，所以较大的消息向后退
so the bigger message go backwards the Alpha message is to go forward so what

198
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:17,840
Alpha消息是要继续前进，所以我要去做的就是
so the bigger message go backwards the Alpha message is to go forward so what

199
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,490
Alpha消息是要继续前进，所以我要去做的就是
Alpha message is to go forward so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to play with

200
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:19,500
Alpha消息是要继续前进，所以我要去做的就是
I'm gonna do is I'm going to play with its equations and device for you they

201
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,400
它的方程式和设备为您，他们提出了三个问题，它看起来
I'm gonna do is I'm going to play with its equations and device for you they

202
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,600
它的方程式和设备为您，他们提出了三个问题，它看起来
its equations and device for you they come up in three questions and it looks

203
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,610
它的方程式和设备为您，他们提出了三个问题，它看起来
come up in three questions and it looks sort of a massive algebraic calculation

204
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,740
大量的代数计算，但我建议您这样做，因为
come up in three questions and it looks sort of a massive algebraic calculation

205
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,150
大量的代数计算，但我建议您这样做，因为
sort of a massive algebraic calculation but I recommend that you do it because

206
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
大量的代数计算，但我建议您这样做，因为
but I recommend that you do it because not only you'll be happy that you

207
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,370
您不仅会发现卡尔曼滤波器方程式而感到高兴
but I recommend that you do it because not only you'll be happy that you

与完全不同于碳驱动器的方式完全不同
way carbon driver which is actually different from the one we already have

213
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,300
与我们在先前的讲座中已经做过的有所不同，但是有
way carbon driver which is actually different from the one we already have

214
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,790
与我们在先前的讲座中已经做过的有所不同，但是有
different from the one we already have done in the earlier lecture but there is

215
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
与我们在先前的讲座中已经做过的有所不同，但是有
done in the earlier lecture but there is much to learn both from Esther's passing

216
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,920
从以斯帖的过世和与高斯人的比赛中可以学到很多东西

you want this more thing the backward will do it if you're gonna do the amount

368
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,550
如果您要做的是量，我们会做的，基本上我们必须做更多的事情
you want this more thing the backward will do it if you're gonna do the amount

369
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,620
如果您要做的是量，我们会做的，基本上我们必须做更多的事情
will do it if you're gonna do the amount we have to basically do more how can be

370
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:51,630
如果您要做的是量，我们会做的，基本上我们必须做更多的事情
we have to basically do more how can be the lesson I'm gonna use the notation

371
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,340
我将使用Bishop的书中的符号来简化
we have to basically do more how can be the lesson I'm gonna use the notation

372
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,389
我将使用Bishop的书中的符号来简化
the lesson I'm gonna use the notation from Bishop's book actually to simplify

373
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:58,399
我将使用Bishop的书中的符号来简化
from Bishop's book actually to simplify the notation for the you variables that

374
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,210
您拥有的变量的表示法，但事实是我们存在
from Bishop's book actually to simplify the notation for the you variables that

375
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,940
您拥有的变量的表示法，但事实是我们存在
the notation for the you variables that we had but the fact we there were

376
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:04,950
您拥有的变量的表示法，但事实是我们存在
we had but the fact we there were nothing else but a constant term in the

377
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,600
除了这些分布的均值中的常数项，我
we had but the fact we there were nothing else but a constant term in the

378
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,610
除了这些分布的均值中的常数项，我
nothing else but a constant term in the the mean of these distributions I

379
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:10,620
除了这些分布的均值中的常数项，我
the mean of these distributions I omitted here but actually if you can

380
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,160
此处省略，但实际上，如果您可以解决，则可以得到最终结果
the mean of these distributions I omitted here but actually if you can

381
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,829
此处省略，但实际上，如果您可以解决，则可以得到最终结果
omitted here but actually if you can solve you can take the final results in

382
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839
此处省略，但实际上，如果您可以解决，则可以得到最终结果
solve you can take the final results in with a trivial trick you can discover

383
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,590
用一个简单的技巧，您可以发现您知道的修改问题

with a trivial trick you can discover the you know the modify the question

385
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:21,779
用一个简单的技巧，您可以发现您知道的修改问题
the you know the modify the question when there is an extra term of the means

386
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,630
当这里有额外的手段时，但现在专注于
the you know the modify the question when there is an extra term of the means

387
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,449
当这里有额外的手段时，但现在专注于
when there is an extra term of the means here but right now concentrate on the

388
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:26,459
当这里有额外的手段时，但现在专注于
here but right now concentrate on the greatest or questioners look like right

389
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,310
最伟大或发问者看起来很正确，因此Rama会拒绝过渡
here but right now concentrate on the greatest or questioners look like right

390
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:35,509
最伟大或发问者看起来很正确，因此Rama会拒绝过渡
greatest or questioners look like right so a an Rama will decline the transition

391
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
最伟大或发问者看起来很正确，因此Rama会拒绝过渡
so a an Rama will decline the transition model for the states and this is the

392
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,300
状态的模型，这是带有度量的观察模型
so a an Rama will decline the transition model for the states and this is the

393
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,900
状态的模型，这是带有度量的观察模型
model for the states and this is the observation model with metrics it here

394
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:41,910

observation model with metrics it here Sigma and C n Sigma remember this

395
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,110
Sigma和C n Sigma记得这一点，因为我会忘记

396
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,720
Sigma和C n Sigma记得这一点，因为我会忘记
Sigma and C n Sigma remember this because I will forget the and we will be

397
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:47,730
Sigma和C n Sigma记得这一点，因为我会忘记
because I will forget the and we will be lost to the algebra okay so a and gamma

398
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,100
输给了代数好吧，所以我们应该从一些
because I will forget the and we will be lost to the algebra okay so a and gamma

399
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,449
输给了代数好吧，所以我们应该从一些
lost to the algebra okay so a and gamma C and Sigma we supposed to from some

400
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:56,459
输给了代数好吧，所以我们应该从一些
C and Sigma we supposed to from some initial state and so the initial state

401
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:59,060
初始状态，因此初始状态也将作为高斯给出
C and Sigma we supposed to from some initial state and so the initial state

402
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,530
初始状态，因此初始状态也将作为高斯给出
initial state and so the initial state is going to be given also as a Gaussian

403
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:00,540
初始状态，因此初始状态也将作为高斯给出
is going to be given also as a Gaussian I mean we you can see actually later on

404
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,009
我的意思是，如果有时间，我们可以稍后在幻灯片中实际看到
is going to be given also as a Gaussian I mean we you can see actually later on

405
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:06,850
我的意思是，如果有时间，我们可以稍后在幻灯片中实际看到
I mean we you can see actually later on maybe in the slide if we have time and

406
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:06,860
我的意思是，如果有时间，我们可以稍后在幻灯片中实际看到
maybe in the slide if we have time and remember I will let you know if this is

407
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,130
记住，我会让你知道这是否不是高斯混合
maybe in the slide if we have time and remember I will let you know if this is

408
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,590
记住，我会让你知道这是否不是高斯混合
remember I will let you know if this is somehow not a Gaussian Gaussian mixture

409
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:12,600
记住，我会让你知道这是否不是高斯混合
somehow not a Gaussian Gaussian mixture then you don't get you get the different

410
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,100
那你就不会得到不同的方程式和正确的滤波，所以
somehow not a Gaussian Gaussian mixture then you don't get you get the different

411
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,590
那你就不会得到不同的方程式和正确的滤波，所以
then you don't get you get the different equations and kind of filtering right so

412
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:18,600
那你就不会得到不同的方程式和正确的滤波，所以
equations and kind of filtering right so this is not a job basically in to start

413
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,930
从高斯开始这基本上不是一项工作，否则您可能会进入
equations and kind of filtering right so this is not a job basically in to start

414
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,000
从高斯开始这基本上不是一项工作，否则您可能会进入
this is not a job basically in to start with a Gaussian otherwise you may get in

415
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,010
从高斯开始这基本上不是一项工作，否则您可能会进入
with a Gaussian otherwise you may get in trouble so mister questions basically if

416
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,460
麻烦，所以如果您不希望用书面形式提出问题，基本上可以提出一些疑问
with a Gaussian otherwise you may get in trouble so mister questions basically if

417
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,380
麻烦，所以如果您不希望用书面形式提出问题，基本上可以提出一些疑问
trouble so mister questions basically if you don't want them in written in terms

418
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:27,390
麻烦，所以如果您不希望用书面形式提出问题，基本上可以提出一些疑问
you don't want them in written in terms of distributions you know this is how

419
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,630
您知道这就是问题的分布
you don't want them in written in terms of distributions you know this is how

420
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,009

of distributions you know this is how the questions look like they are all

421
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:31,019
您知道这就是问题的分布
the questions look like they are all linear right big asked why we call this

422
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,319
线性右大问为什么我们称其为线性动力学

424
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:34,970
线性右大问为什么我们称其为线性动力学
a linear dynamical so later on we will actually if I don't

425
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:41,330
所以稍后，如果没有时间，我们将不得不阅读
a linear dynamical so later on we will actually if I don't

426
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,800
所以稍后，如果没有时间，我们将不得不阅读
so later on we will actually if I don't have time you would have to read it

427
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:42,810
所以稍后，如果没有时间，我们将不得不阅读
have time you would have to read it right but we can expect this where for

428
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,610
是的，但是我们可以期望在这里，例如，而不是拥有

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:48,510
是的，但是我们可以期望在这里，例如，而不是拥有
example here rather than having something a function of Z n minus 1

431
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,210
Z n减去1的函数，也许我们可以放Z n的函数f

be able to update new n minus 1 and DN minus 1 the UN and via ok

487
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:50,309
能够通过OK更新新的n减1和DN减1的联合国
minus 1 the UN and via ok nothing major so basically what I have

488
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:52,279
没什么大不了的，所以基本上我所做的就是我采用了这个方程式
minus 1 the UN and via ok nothing major so basically what I have

489
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:56,060
没什么大不了的，所以基本上我所做的就是我采用了这个方程式
nothing major so basically what I have done is I took this equation and I

490
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,070
没什么大不了的，所以基本上我所做的就是我采用了这个方程式
done is I took this equation and I expanded it by plugging in all the terms

491
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,279
通过插入所有术语来扩展它，而CN再次记得确实不是
done is I took this equation and I expanded it by plugging in all the terms

492
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:02,600
通过插入所有术语来扩展它，而CN再次记得确实不是
expanded it by plugging in all the terms still CN remember again is really not

493
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:02,610
通过插入所有术语来扩展它，而CN再次记得确实不是
still CN remember again is really not necessary sometimes confusing but to

494
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,029
有时会令人困惑，但要使其成为一个等号，您需要
still CN remember again is really not necessary sometimes confusing but to

495
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:07,909
有时会令人困惑，但要使其成为一个等号，您需要
necessary sometimes confusing but to make this an equal sign you need that so

496
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
有时会令人困惑，但要使其成为一个等号，您需要
make this an equal sign you need that so this is the mr. x this Gaussian okay the

497
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:14,480
这是先生。 x这是高斯式的，观察模型很清楚
make this an equal sign you need that so this is the mr. x this Gaussian okay the

498
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,330
这是先生。 x这是高斯式的，观察模型很清楚
this is the mr. x this Gaussian okay the observation model is clear the message

499
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:17,340
这是先生。 x这是高斯式的，观察模型很清楚
observation model is clear the message at n minus 1 is there so we suppose we

500
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,610
在n减1处，所以我们假设我们知道这一点，这就是过渡
observation model is clear the message at n minus 1 is there so we suppose we

501
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,100
在n减1处，所以我们假设我们知道这一点，这就是过渡
at n minus 1 is there so we suppose we know this and this is the transition

502
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,110
在n减1处，所以我们假设我们知道这一点，这就是过渡
know this and this is the transition model looks like that ends the N minus 1

503
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,710
模型看起来像这样结束了N减1的积分，所以再次
know this and this is the transition model looks like that ends the N minus 1

504
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:29,330
模型看起来像这样结束了N减1的积分，所以再次
model looks like that ends the N minus 1 is integrated off ok so again the

505
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:29,340
模型看起来像这样结束了N减1的积分，所以再次
is integrated off ok so again the problem is given this because we will do

506
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,919
给这个问题是因为我们将在前进的过程中做到这一点
is integrated off ok so again the problem is given this because we will do

it this as we go forward we want to compute that okay

509
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:40,730
我们要计算没关系
it this as we go forward we want to compute that okay

510
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,240

I have the product of two gaussians but the min of one of them right is linear

548
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,930
所以这非常非常重，就像给定X的概率为Y
I have the product of two gaussians but the min of one of them right is linear

549
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:06,940

550
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:16,870
所以这非常非常重，就像给定X的概率为Y
so it's very very heaviest is like having a probability of Y given X all

551
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:16,880
所以这非常非常重，就像给定X的概率为Y
having a probability of Y given X all right but this linear in X times the

552
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,030
是的，但是X的线性乘以X的概率，我要问的是
having a probability of Y given X all right but this linear in X times the

553
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,790
是的，但是X的线性乘以X的概率，我要问的是
right but this linear in X times the probability of X and what I'm asking is

554
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:21,800
是的，但是X的线性乘以X的概率，我要问的是
probability of X and what I'm asking is to find the probability of Y when I

555
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,220
在我正确整合X时找到Y的概率，因为我不会

00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:30,310
在我正确整合X时找到Y的概率，因为我不会
to find the probability of Y when I integrate X out right because I won't

557
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,320
在我正确整合X时找到Y的概率，因为我不会
integrate X out right because I won't see n minus 1 out right so basically

558
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,460
看到n减1就好了，基本上这就像有关节
integrate X out right because I won't see n minus 1 out right so basically

559
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,110
看到n减1就好了，基本上这就像有关节
see n minus 1 out right so basically this is like having the Joint

560
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,120
看到n减1就好了，基本上这就像有关节
this is like having the Joint Distribution of two versions then you

561
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,970
然后分配两个版本，您想多角色撒谎
this is like having the Joint Distribution of two versions then you

563
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
然后分配两个版本，您想多角色撒谎
want to multi-role lies okay so the idea is this is the formula

564
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,130
好的，所以这是我剪切并粘贴到所有地方的公式
want to multi-role lies okay so the idea is this is the formula

565
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,680
好的，所以这是我剪切并粘贴到所有地方的公式
okay so the idea is this is the formula that I cut and paste it not everywhere

566
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:44,690
好的，所以这是我剪切并粘贴到所有地方的公式
that I cut and paste it not everywhere but you guys will do the algebra and you

567
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,770

00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:05,409
看起来像这样，他来的意思是均值是m n减去1
that looks like that and he comes that the mean is a times mu n minus 1

605
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:05,419
看起来像这样，他来的意思是均值是m n减去1
that the mean is a times mu n minus 1 and the variance is P n minus 1 where

606
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:08,409
并且方差是P n减去1，其中方差是

607
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:10,899
并且方差是P n减去1，其中方差是
and the variance is P n minus 1 where the variance is written by this is

608
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:10,909
并且方差是P n减去1，其中方差是
the variance is written by this is coming up from this nice form

609
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:12,399
从这个很好的形式出现好吧，你不必相信我
the variance is written by this is coming up from this nice form

610
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:14,799
从这个很好的形式出现好吧，你不必相信我
coming up from this nice form okay you don't have to believe me

611
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:14,809
从这个很好的形式出现好吧，你不必相信我
okay you don't have to believe me because this is the variance you plug it

612
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:19,119
因为这就是您插入的差异，这就是您所能接受的
okay you don't have to believe me because this is the variance you plug it

613
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,049
因为这就是您插入的差异，这就是您所能接受的
because this is the variance you plug it in and that's what you get okay

614
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:23,059
因为这就是您插入的差异，这就是您所能接受的
in and that's what you get okay all right so obviously I'm putting n

615
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:28,419
好吧，所以很明显我在这里放n减1，因为你知道
in and that's what you get okay all right so obviously I'm putting n

616
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:31,089
好吧，所以很明显我在这里放n减1，因为你知道
all right so obviously I'm putting n minus 1 here everything because you know

617
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:31,099
好吧，所以很明显我在这里放n减1，因为你知道
minus 1 here everything because you know you know this whole divided was fairly

618
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:32,589
你知道这个整体除以时间减去-1是合理的，所以我们称其为
minus 1 here everything because you know you know this whole divided was fairly

619
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:35,169
你知道这个整体除以时间减去-1是合理的，所以我们称其为
you know this whole divided was fairly for the time and minus 1 so we call this

620
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:35,179
你知道这个整体除以时间减去-1是合理的，所以我们称其为
for the time and minus 1 so we call this intermediate mathematics PN minus 1 okay

621
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:40,959
中级数学PN减1好的
for the time and minus 1 so we call this intermediate mathematics PN minus 1 okay

622
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:41,759
所以这个积分是Z的决定，所以这个触手是
for the time and minus 1 so we call this intermediate mathematics PN minus 1 okay

623
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:41,769
所以这个积分是Z的决定，所以这个触手是


624
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:51,249

so this integral it comes out to be a decision in Z so this tentacle is an

625
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:51,259
所以这个积分是Z的决定，所以这个触手是

675
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,050
以后再来没关系，对Sigma n的兴趣不大，但是
again one less interested on Sigma n but if we want to make that equation to be

676
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,070
如果我们想使等式具有等号，则必须

678
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:56,900
如果我们想使等式具有等号，则必须
to have an equal sign right it has to look like that this the normalization

679
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,300
看起来像是归一化因子，所以看这个等式

给定数据x1至X标签，可以
distribution is the probability of Zn given the data x1 to X label that okay

692
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,230
所以这是平均值，这是此过滤分布可以
distribution is the probability of Zn given the data x1 to X label that okay

693
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,240
所以这是平均值，这是此过滤分布可以

so you take basically the printing distribution of 10-1

706
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,030
所以您基本上采用10-1的打印分布
distribution of 10-1 and you push fun with the mean with the

707
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,360
然后用转换矩阵a推平均值，就可以了
distribution of 10-1 and you push fun with the mean with the

708
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,750
然后用转换矩阵a推平均值，就可以了

transition matrix a you sit up okay so that's what it is and now we have

710
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,120
就是这样，现在我们有了这个增益矩阵乘以一些误差，
transition matrix a you sit up okay so that's what it is and now we have

00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:10,740
就是这样，现在我们有了这个增益矩阵乘以一些误差，
this gain matrix times some error and that error is the observation that you

713
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,520
该错误是您突然看到的观察结果，您看到的是您的数据

okay and we were breaking discussed me in one word

855
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,290
好吧，我们一言不发地讨论了我
in one word well today all right so the debate looks

856
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:08,350
今天很好，所以辩论看起来像我们基本上必须去
in one word well today all right so the debate looks

857
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,170
今天很好，所以辩论看起来像我们基本上必须去
well today all right so the debate looks like that we basically have to go

858
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:11,180
今天很好，所以辩论看起来像我们基本上必须去
like that we basically have to go backward we'd have to start to the last

859
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,030
倒退，我们必须开始到最后一个，所以十加一才能完成大师

861
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:15,260
倒退，我们必须开始到最后一个，所以十加一才能完成大师
so ten plus one to complete the master then I have defined exactly the message

862
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,100
那么我已经在这里准确定义了消息，以便这是平等的，包括

870
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:33,020
但是我有这个方程，我们可以标准化我们的标准化形式
normalize our normalized form okay this is is precisely God so and again what's

871
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:39,790
恰恰是上帝，更大的信息的意义是
normalize our normalized form okay this is is precisely God so and again what's

00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:09,600
我是从hmm阶开始的吗，所以我们需要计算这个联合
hidden order am L going from the hmm order okay so we

968
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,260
我是从hmm阶开始的吗，所以我们需要计算这个联合
am L going from the hmm order okay so we will need to compute this joint

969
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:13,270
我是从hmm阶开始的吗，所以我们需要计算这个联合
will need to compute this joint distribution for staining of Zn -

00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,270
您知道多种方式，这显然是最简单的方法
here obviously the most trivial way to do it is to take the masters to derive

976
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:28,500
是不是要让大师们得出，所以不小于负1和alpha消息
here obviously the most trivial way to do it is to take the masters to derive

977
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,600
是不是要让大师们得出，所以不小于负1和alpha消息
do it is to take the masters to derive so no than minus 1 and alpha message

978
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:30,610
是不是要让大师们得出，所以不小于负1和alpha消息
so no than minus 1 and alpha message that the message that I should not beat

979
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,610
我不应该从右边打败的信息，然后与

980
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,700
我不应该从右边打败的信息，然后与
that the message that I should not beat up from right and then multiply with the

981
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:35,710
我不应该从右边打败的信息，然后与
up from right and then multiply with the transition model and the observation

手表记得麻省理工学院做过这种类型的手表的人
at MIT that had done this type of calculations many 10 years course oh so

1330
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,760
计算很多10年的过程哦，所以基本上是高斯人进行此更新
at MIT that had done this type of calculations many 10 years course oh so

00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,000
计算很多10年的过程哦，所以基本上是高斯人进行此更新
calculations many 10 years course oh so basically yes gaussians make this update

1332
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,010
计算很多10年的过程哦，所以基本上是高斯人进行此更新
basically yes gaussians make this update progress analytical but you know if you

1333
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:18,920
进行分析，但您知道是否要使用很长的时间
basically yes gaussians make this update progress analytical but you know if you

1334
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,690
进行分析，但您知道是否要使用很长的时间
progress analytical but you know if you want to use anything that's long

1335
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:20,700
进行分析，但您知道是否要使用很长的时间
want to use anything that's long Gaussian ignoring new territories and

1336
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,260
高斯忽略新领域，您必须非常小心
want to use anything that's long Gaussian ignoring new territories and

1337
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,550
高斯忽略新领域，您必须非常小心
Gaussian ignoring new territories and you have to be very careful how you do

1338
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:25,560
高斯忽略新领域，您必须非常小心
you have to be very careful how you do okay

1339
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,510
好吧，这并不意味着你做不到
you have to be very careful how you do okay

1340
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:28,040
好吧，这并不意味着你做不到
okay it doesn't mean you cannot be done what

1341
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:28,050
好吧，这并不意味着你做不到
it doesn't mean you cannot be done what he means is not going to be easy to

1342
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:33,650
他的意思是说要计算这个主题不容易
it doesn't mean you cannot be done what he means is not going to be easy to

00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:49,490
他的意思是说要计算这个主题不容易
he means is not going to be easy to compute this topic is related with this

1344
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:49,500
他的意思是说要计算这个主题不容易
compute this topic is related with this type of exchange extensions when the

1345
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,920
消息不是高斯时的交换分机类型您如何

type of exchange extensions when the messages are non Gaussian how do you

1347
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:54,150
消息不是高斯时的交换分机类型您如何
messages are non Gaussian how do you actually okay is there are other any

1348
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:57,740
其实还可以，还有其他方法可以吗

actually okay is there are other any other methods okay

1350
00:49:58,910 --> 00:49:58,920
其实还可以，还有其他方法可以吗
other methods okay and one of the methods that allows you

1351
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,180
以及一种允许您发送不属于您的消息的方法之一
other methods okay and one of the methods that allows you

1352
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,310

1353
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:04,320
以及一种允许您发送不属于您的消息的方法之一
to do messages that they are non Gaussian is to use a particle

1354
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,040
高斯是使用痕迹的粒子表示，因此
to do messages that they are non Gaussian is to use a particle

1355
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,040
高斯是使用痕迹的粒子表示，因此
Gaussian is to use a particle representation of the of the vestiges so

1356
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:10,050
高斯是使用痕迹的粒子表示，因此
representation of the of the vestiges so you can figure out basically having the

1357
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:14,240
您可以弄清楚基本上用顶部框表示的消息
representation of the of the vestiges so you can figure out basically having the

00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:43,320
非常强大，例如在解决一切问题的机器人技术方面
in robotics in tackling everything is using particle methods because those

1372
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,250
使用粒子方法，因为那些发射时间长的高斯是

emissions long work gaussians are the wrong approach equation so the only way

1375
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:52,160
错误的进近方程式，因此唯一的出路是时间逼近法或

好吧，我来讨论一下这种预测和状态更新
sorry I'm not going to tell you everything

1395
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:31,480
好吧，我来讨论一下这种预测和状态更新


1396
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:44,890
好吧，我来讨论一下这种预测和状态更新
alright so me discuss sort of this prediction and update of the state that

1397
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:44,900
好吧，我来讨论一下这种预测和状态更新
prediction and update of the state that we use basically for the Kalman filter

1398
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,279
我们基本上将以前的讲座中的卡尔曼滤波器方程式用于
prediction and update of the state that we use basically for the Kalman filter

1399
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:50,440
我们基本上将以前的讲座中的卡尔曼滤波器方程式用于
we use basically for the Kalman filter equations of the previous lectures and

1400
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:50,450
我们基本上将以前的讲座中的卡尔曼滤波器方程式用于
equations of the previous lectures and when I show here is rather than of

1401
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:53,170
当我在这里展示时，而不是在他们认为当时建立一种状态
equations of the previous lectures and when I show here is rather than of

1402
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:57,339
当我在这里展示时，而不是在他们认为当时建立一种状态
when I show here is rather than of making one state at the time they think

1403
00:51:57,339 --> 00:51:57,349
当我在这里展示时，而不是在他们认为当时建立一种状态
making one state at the time they think so in this case from the Stefan versus

1404
00:51:57,349 --> 00:52:00,640
因此，在这种情况下，根据Stefan与预测，我得到的数据是1到n的负值
making one state at the time they think so in this case from the Stefan versus

1405
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,490
因此，在这种情况下，根据Stefan与预测，我得到的数据是1到n的负值
so in this case from the Stefan versus prediction I have data from 1 to n minus

1406
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:03,500
因此，在这种情况下，根据Stefan与预测，我得到的数据是1到n的负值
prediction I have data from 1 to n minus 1 all right

1407
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,839
1好的，我正在更新所有状态
prediction I have data from 1 to n minus 1 all right

1408
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:07,029
1好的，我正在更新所有状态
1 all right and I'm updating all the states

1409
00:52:07,029 --> 00:52:07,039
1好的，我正在更新所有状态
and I'm updating all the states including our state n and the addition

1410
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,640
包括我们的状态n以及预测步骤的添加是
and I'm updating all the states including our state n and the addition

1411
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,609
包括我们的状态n以及预测步骤的添加是
including our state n and the addition of the prediction step is the end of

1412
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:12,619
包括我们的状态n以及预测步骤的添加是
of the prediction step is the end of this distribution at the joint of Z's

1413
00:52:12,619 --> 00:52:15,880
在给定X 1 n减1的情况下，Z的连接处从1到N减1的分布
of the prediction step is the end of this distribution at the joint of Z's

1414
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,510
在给定X 1 n减1的情况下，Z的连接处从1到N减1的分布
this distribution at the joint of Z's from 1 to N minus 1 given X 1 n minus 1

1415
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:19,520
在给定X 1 n减1的情况下，Z的连接处从1到N减1的分布
from 1 to N minus 1 given X 1 n minus 1 so this prediction one step ahead only

1416
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,510
因此，这一预测仅向前迈进了一段时期，
from 1 to N minus 1 given X 1 n minus 1 so this prediction one step ahead only

1417
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:27,730
因此，这一预测仅向前迈进了一段时期，
so this prediction one step ahead only involves lives of these dynamics the

1418
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:27,740
因此，这一预测仅向前迈进了一段时期，
involves lives of these dynamics the probability of Zn given Zn minus 1 okay

1419
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,490
给定Zn减去1好的Zn的概率，因此再次用于过滤a
involves lives of these dynamics the probability of Zn given Zn minus 1 okay

1420
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:34,630
给定Zn减去1好的Zn的概率，因此再次用于过滤a
probability of Zn given Zn minus 1 okay right so again in for the filtering a

1421
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:34,640
给定Zn减去1好的Zn的概率，因此再次用于过滤a
right so again in for the filtering a question the prediction step involving

1422
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,089
对此处涉及变量的预测步骤提出质疑，只是因为我
right so again in for the filtering a question the prediction step involving

1423
00:52:37,089 --> 00:52:40,299
对此处涉及变量的预测步骤提出质疑，只是因为我
question the prediction step involving the variables here here just because I

1424
00:52:40,299 --> 00:52:40,309
对此处涉及变量的预测步骤提出质疑，只是因为我
the variables here here just because I company's equations for much more

1425
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:42,519
公司方程式，用于更通用的计算类型I
the variables here here just because I company's equations for much more

1426
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:45,779
公司方程式，用于更通用的计算类型I
company's equations for much more general sort of type of calculations I

1427
00:52:45,779 --> 00:52:45,789
公司方程式，用于更通用的计算类型I
general sort of type of calculations I demonstrate this when we keep the

1428
00:52:45,789 --> 00:52:48,400
当我们保持所有这些变量的后验确定时，证明这一点
general sort of type of calculations I demonstrate this when we keep the

1429
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,289
当我们保持所有这些变量的后验确定时，证明这一点
demonstrate this when we keep the posterior of all of these variables ok

1430
00:52:50,289 --> 00:52:50,299
当我们保持所有这些变量的后验确定时，证明这一点
posterior of all of these variables ok so this is the prediction for one step

1431
00:52:50,299 --> 00:52:52,630
所以这是对我们已经看到的，以及随着我们前进的一步的预测
posterior of all of these variables ok so this is the prediction for one step

1432
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:56,470
所以这是对我们已经看到的，以及随着我们前进的一步的预测
so this is the prediction for one step ahead that we have seen and and as we

1433
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:56,480
所以这是对我们已经看到的，以及随着我们前进的一步的预测
ahead that we have seen and and as we discussed even today if you want now if

1434
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,049
甚至在今天讨论过，如果您现在想要，如果您观察到想要的话
ahead that we have seen and and as we discussed even today if you want now if

1435
00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:00,290
甚至在今天讨论过，如果您现在想要，如果您观察到想要的话
discussed even today if you want now if you observe want you

1436
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:00,300
甚至在今天讨论过，如果您现在想要，如果您观察到想要的话
you observe want you the point xn and you want to update the

1437
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,080
xn点，您想更新所有Z的n到n的正则
you observe want you the point xn and you want to update the

1438
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,810
xn点，您想更新所有Z的n到n的正则
the point xn and you want to update the prospero of all the Z's up to n then

1439
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:05,820
xn点，您想更新所有Z的n到n的正则
prospero of all the Z's up to n then definitely what you need to do is take

1440
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,430
当然，您需要做的就是将此分布乘以
prospero of all the Z's up to n then definitely what you need to do is take

1441
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:09,590
当然，您需要做的就是将此分布乘以
definitely what you need to do is take this distribution multiplied with the

1442
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:09,600
当然，您需要做的就是将此分布乘以
this distribution multiplied with the observation model xn given Zn so in a

1443
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,820
观测模型xn给定了Zn，所以在一个粒子中会存在金属，因此，如果您知道
this distribution multiplied with the observation model xn given Zn so in a

1444
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:17,150
观测模型xn给定了Zn，所以在一个粒子中会存在金属，因此，如果您知道
observation model xn given Zn so in a particle that metals so if you you know

1445
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:17,160
观测模型xn给定了Zn，所以在一个粒子中会存在金属，因此，如果您知道
particle that metals so if you you know make all of this delusion then you get

1446
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,220
进行所有这些妄想，然后就可以得到这些过滤器方程式，因为
particle that metals so if you you know make all of this delusion then you get

1447
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:26,660
进行所有这些妄想，然后就可以得到这些过滤器方程式，因为
make all of this delusion then you get that these filter equations ok because

1448
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:26,670
进行所有这些妄想，然后就可以得到这些过滤器方程式，因为
that these filter equations ok because here I don't have all my observations on

1449
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,330
在这里，我没有对每个子项目的所有观察来帮助确定，所以您可以获得颜色
that these filter equations ok because here I don't have all my observations on

1450
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,790
在这里，我没有对每个子项目的所有观察来帮助确定，所以您可以获得颜色
here I don't have all my observations on each sub to help ok so you get the color

1451
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:31,800
在这里，我没有对每个子项目的所有观察来帮助确定，所以您可以获得颜色
each sub to help ok so you get the color of entry questions for this so the idea

1452
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:38,870
的入门问题，所以这个粒子水平的想法正在问
each sub to help ok so you get the color of entry questions for this so the idea

1453
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:42,770
的入门问题，所以这个粒子水平的想法正在问
of entry questions for this so the idea of this particle levels are asking

1454
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:42,780
的入门问题，所以这个粒子水平的想法正在问
of this particle levels are asking informant in time to represent these

1455
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:45,470
线人及时用样本来代表这些分布而没有
of this particle levels are asking informant in time to represent these

1456
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:48,200
线人及时用样本来代表这些分布而没有
informant in time to represent these distributions with samples without

1457
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:48,210
线人及时用样本来代表这些分布而没有
distributions with samples without detection

1458
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,090
确定还可以，并且以某种方式获得另一种理解
distributions with samples without detection

1459
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:55,100
确定还可以，并且以某种方式获得另一种理解
detection ok and somehow another one understanding

1460
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:55,110
确定还可以，并且以某种方式获得另一种理解
ok and somehow another one understanding the distributions as you go from one

1461
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,110
从一步到另一步的分布基本上是
ok and somehow another one understanding the distributions as you go from one

1462
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:00,250
从一步到另一步的分布基本上是
the distributions as you go from one step to another are provide basically

1463
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:00,260
从一步到另一步的分布基本上是
step to another are provide basically the the waves of this Delta functions as

1464
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:05,420
当您从n减1到n右移时，此Delta的波浪会起作用
step to another are provide basically the the waves of this Delta functions as

1465
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:11,870
当您从n减1到n右移时，此Delta的波浪会起作用
the the waves of this Delta functions as you go from n minus 1 to n right

1466
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:11,880
当您从n减1到n右移时，此Delta的波浪会起作用
you go from n minus 1 to n right so the idea here is that you have Delta

1467
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,480
所以这里的想法是您有Delta函数，但是我们将对它们进行一些分类
you go from n minus 1 to n right so the idea here is that you have Delta

1468
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,330
所以这里的想法是您有Delta函数，但是我们将对它们进行一些分类
so the idea here is that you have Delta functions but in shall we do class some

1469
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:17,340
所以这里的想法是您有Delta函数，但是我们将对它们进行一些分类
functions but in shall we do class some of the Cardinal the weight is the same

1470
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,130
红衣主教的体重是相同的，所以我们将有加权的样本
functions but in shall we do class some of the Cardinal the weight is the same

1471
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:22,670
红衣主教的体重是相同的，所以我们将有加权的样本
of the Cardinal the weight is the same so we're going to have weighted samples

1472
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:22,680
红衣主教的体重是相同的，所以我们将有加权的样本
so we're going to have weighted samples to express these distributions and if

1473
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,910
表达这些分布，如果您是我，则表示这些分布
so we're going to have weighted samples to express these distributions and if

1474
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:27,710
表达这些分布，如果您是我，则表示这些分布
to express these distributions and if your I these distributions in terms of

1475
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:27,720
表达这些分布，如果您是我，则表示这些分布
your I these distributions in terms of samples you can actually in principle

represent any sort of distributions can be anything all right

1480
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,990
没关系，任何事情都是非常分散的
be anything all right anything that the distribution is very

1481
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:36,000
没关系，任何事情都是非常分散的
anything that the distribution is very complex you will need more samples but

1482
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,380
复杂，您将需要更多样本，但是这里的想法是，如果您
anything that the distribution is very complex you will need more samples but

1483
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:45,860
复杂，您将需要更多样本，但是这里的想法是，如果您
complex you will need more samples but this ideas here it comes out that if you

1484
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:45,870
复杂，您将需要更多样本，但是这里的想法是，如果您
this ideas here it comes out that if you take the samples and somehow you update

1485
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:48,650
采取示例，以某种方式进行更新，是迈向另一步的方法

1529
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:23,950
首先，我需要用这种动力学模型进行最公平的选择，然后
which with this dynamical model and then I need to apply the observation the

1530
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:27,870
我需要在给定Z的情况下应用观察X的发射概率P

好吧，如果您应用了
take this update equations other hands before alright and if you apply the

1538
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:43,030
好吧，如果您应用了
before alright and if you apply the levity update equation somewhere I have

1539
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:45,540
某处的高度更新方程我有一个更新方程这是什么

00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:50,820
是向前迈出一步的预测唯一要做的就是休息
an update equation what is it here this is the prediction for one step ahead the

1543
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,360
是向前迈出一步的预测唯一要做的就是休息
is the prediction for one step ahead the only thing you have to do is take rest

1544
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:53,370
是向前迈出一步的预测唯一要做的就是休息
only thing you have to do is take rest approach in terms of particles and then

1545
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:56,790
接近粒子，然后将其与动力学模型相乘
only thing you have to do is take rest approach in terms of particles and then

1546
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:59,400
接近粒子，然后将其与动力学模型相乘
approach in terms of particles and then multiply this with the dynamical model

1547
00:56:59,400 --> 00:56:59,410
接近粒子，然后将其与动力学模型相乘
multiply this with the dynamical model of P of Z L given Zn minus 1 so

1548
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:03,780
ZL的P的给定为Zn减去1，所以基本上这是我在这里所做的
multiply this with the dynamical model of P of Z L given Zn minus 1 so

1549
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,180
ZL的P的给定为Zn减去1，所以基本上这是我在这里所做的
of P of Z L given Zn minus 1 so basically this is what I have done here

1550
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:05,190
ZL的P的给定为Zn减去1，所以基本上这是我在这里所做的
basically this is what I have done here all right I compute

1551
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:07,350
好吧，我计算CN的后验加一个仍然给定的
basically this is what I have done here all right I compute

1552
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:11,100
好吧，我计算CN的后验加一个仍然给定的
all right I compute the posterior of CN plus one still given

1553
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:11,110
好吧，我计算CN的后验加一个仍然给定的
the posterior of CN plus one still given heaven with only the date of the time

1554
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:13,890
天堂，只有时间的男人
the posterior of CN plus one still given heaven with only the date of the time

1555
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:14,400
天堂，只有时间的男人
heaven with only the date of the time man

1556
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:14,410
天堂，只有时间的男人
man so this one required this posterior of

1557
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:18,870
因此，这需要CN的后验，并在末尾给定1，然后
man so this one required this posterior of

1558
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:21,360
因此，这需要CN的后验，并在末尾给定1，然后
so this one required this posterior of CN plus 1 given at the end and then

1559
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:21,370
因此，这需要CN的后验，并在末尾给定1，然后
CN plus 1 given at the end and then because you have these Delta functions

1560
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,510
因为您有这些Delta函数，我们必须计算这个后验
CN plus 1 given at the end and then because you have these Delta functions

1561
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:26,300
因为您有这些Delta函数，我们必须计算这个后验
because you have these Delta functions this posterior we have to be calculated

1562
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:26,310
因为您有这些Delta函数，我们必须计算这个后验
this posterior we have to be calculated given its particle I don't know if you

1563
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:30,570
给定它的粒子，我不知道你是否能看到你真正得到的东西
this posterior we have to be calculated given its particle I don't know if you

1564
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,550

given its particle I don't know if you can see what you actually get through

1565
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:32,560
给定它的粒子，我不知道你是否能看到你真正得到的东西
can see what you actually get through there is terms of a Gaussian mixture

1566
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:36,240
有高斯混合项
can see what you actually get through there is terms of a Gaussian mixture

1567
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,070
正确，您可以得到高斯x2分布，因为我们没有
can see what you actually get through there is terms of a Gaussian mixture

1568
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:37,080
正确，您可以得到高斯x2分布，因为我们没有


1569
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:42,480
正确，您可以得到高斯x2分布，因为我们没有
right you get the Gaussian x2 distribution okay and because we don't

1570
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:42,490
正确，您可以得到高斯x2分布，因为我们没有
distribution okay and because we don't like thousand extras what you can do is

1656
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:29,340
就样本而言，分布就是一堆Delta函数
is a bunch of Delta functions all right if you just need these are depending how

1657
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,950
如果您只需要这些，则取决于我们如何进行采样以了解
is a bunch of Delta functions all right if you just need these are depending how

如果您只需要这些，则取决于我们如何进行采样以了解
we do the sampling to know if the weights are equal or they are different

权重相等或不同，所以在这种情况下，您可以从
okay and so in this case you start with so when we see some of the start with

1663
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,360
因此，当我们看到某些起点比其他起点更大时，权重会有所不同

01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:47,470
因此，当我们看到某些起点比其他起点更大时，权重会有所不同
bigger than others the weights different but if you sample from this you notice

1666
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:50,250
但是，如果您从中采样，您会发现像这样的采样随着您的使用而退化
bigger than others the weights different but if you sample from this you notice

01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:54,180
但是，如果您从中采样，您会发现像这样的采样随着您的使用而退化
but if you sample from this you notice like this sample that has degrade as you

1668
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:54,190
但是，如果您从中采样，您会发现像这样的采样随着您的使用而退化
like this sample that has degrade as you sample it gives you two children by just

1669

the idea because there's no worry okay but it's not the new samples all of them

1672
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:03,980
但这不是新样本，现在所有样本都具有相同的方式，然后是

1673
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:08,270
但这不是新样本，现在所有样本都具有相同的方式，然后是

1674
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:08,280
但这不是新样本，现在所有样本都具有相同的方式，然后是
have now equal way okay and then this is your observation model so obviously

1675
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,430
您的观察模型，很明显，这些样本例如在这里，当我们
have now equal way okay and then this is your observation model so obviously

these samples for example here when we passed and prove this observation model

1678
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,180
通过并证明了这个观察模型我们有更大的权重，在这里我们再次

1679
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:17,390
通过并证明了这个观察模型我们有更大的权重，在这里我们再次

1680
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:17,400
通过并证明了这个观察模型我们有更大的权重，在这里我们再次
we have bigger weight and again here we have bigger weights of they're small and

1681
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,400
重量较大，所以重量较小，所以这是一种非常有效的方法
we have bigger weight and again here we have bigger weights of they're small and

1682
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,430
重量较大，所以重量较小，所以这是一种非常有效的方法

1698
01:01:59,840 --> 01:01:59,850
主题当模型不是线性时如何扩展这些想法，所以我们
model is not linear all right so so we had two linear models right both the

1699
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,430
有两个线性模型，它们的动力学都正确，因为您知道的Z
model is not linear all right so so we had two linear models right both the

of the previous state then the common equation so really it's super fancy bra

1765
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:31,800
方程式，所以它真的是超级花式胸罩，我认为那里真的什么也没有
of the previous state then the common equation so really it's super fancy bra

1766
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,450
方程式，所以它真的是超级花式胸罩，我认为那里真的什么也没有

1767
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:33,460
方程式，所以它真的是超级花式胸罩，我认为那里真的什么也没有
there is really nothing there I think the equations are sort of in your eyes

and then cut and paste from the only questions from the new questions but let

1771
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:42,210
新问题中的问题，但让我以图形方式向您展示什么想法
and then cut and paste from the only questions from the new questions but let

1772
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:46,620
新问题中的问题，但让我以图形方式向您展示什么想法

1773
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:46,630
新问题中的问题，但让我以图形方式向您展示什么想法
me show you graphically what the idea here is so remember we have

1774
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:51,440
记住这里，我们有一些运行某些功能的功能
me show you graphically what the idea here is so remember we have

1775
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,250
记住这里，我们有一些运行某些功能的功能
here is so remember we have as some function some running a function

1776
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:55,260
记住这里，我们有一些运行某些功能的功能
as some function some running a function G of X all right so if X is a Gaussian

1777
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:58,750
X的G可以，所以如果X是高斯，则想法是在计算时
as some function some running a function G of X all right so if X is a Gaussian

1778
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:02,450
X的G可以，所以如果X是高斯，则想法是在计算时
G of X all right so if X is a Gaussian the idea is when you compute let's say

1779
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:02,460
X的G可以，所以如果X是高斯，则想法是在计算时
the idea is when you compute let's say which Montecarlo y equals G of X you

1780
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:06,200
蒙特卡洛y等于X的G您没有得到高斯，您得到了真实的
the idea is when you compute let's say which Montecarlo y equals G of X you

1781
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,730
蒙特卡洛y等于X的G您没有得到高斯，您得到了真实的
which Montecarlo y equals G of X you don't get a Gaussian you get a real

1782
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:07,740
蒙特卡洛y等于X的G您没有得到高斯，您得到了真实的
don't get a Gaussian you get a real distribution of usage here so this

1783
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:10,130
此处的使用情况分布，因此该双峰分布还可以，
don't get a Gaussian you get a real distribution of usage here so this

1784
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:12,860
此处的使用情况分布，因此该双峰分布还可以，
distribution of usage here so this bimodal distribution okay so the

1785
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:12,870
此处的使用情况分布，因此该双峰分布还可以，
bimodal distribution okay so the question is not really neat to do when

1786
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:16,640
当我们采用高斯并应用此问题时，问题并不是真的很整洁
bimodal distribution okay so the question is not really neat to do when

1787
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,220
当我们采用高斯并应用此问题时，问题并不是真的很整洁
question is not really neat to do when we take a Gaussian and we apply this

1788
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:19,230
当我们采用高斯并应用此问题时，问题并不是真的很整洁
we take a Gaussian and we apply this mapping to effects to get the Gaussian

1789
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:21,940
映射到效果以获得高斯权，因此扩展了这个想法
we take a Gaussian and we apply this mapping to effects to get the Gaussian

1790
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:27,440
映射到效果以获得高斯权，因此扩展了这个想法
mapping to effects to get the Gaussian right and so the idea for this extended

1791
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:27,450
映射到效果以获得高斯权，因此扩展了这个想法
right and so the idea for this extended color filter is to do linearization in

1792
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:30,440
彩色滤光片是在X ok模式下进行线性化，然后基本上
right and so the idea for this extended color filter is to do linearization in

1793
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:34,450
彩色滤光片是在X ok模式下进行线性化，然后基本上
color filter is to do linearization in the mode of X ok and then basically

1794
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:34,460
彩色滤光片是在X ok模式下进行线性化，然后基本上
the mode of X ok and then basically alright so this is the approximation we

1795
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,980
好吧，这就是近似值，我们可以做得很好，然后我们通过
the mode of X ok and then basically alright so this is the approximation we

1796
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:40,190
好吧，这就是近似值，我们可以做得很好，然后我们通过
alright so this is the approximation we do all right and then we pass the

1797
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:40,200
好吧，这就是近似值，我们可以做得很好，然后我们通过
do all right and then we pass the probability we passed this line through

1798
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:44,120
我们通过X的P的概率通过这条线的概率，这将
do all right and then we pass the probability we passed this line through

1799
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,400
我们通过X的P的概率通过这条线的概率，这将
probability we passed this line through the probability of P of X and that will

1800
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:46,410
我们通过X的P的概率通过这条线的概率，这将
the probability of P of X and that will give me this dotted Gaussian which is

1801
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:49,880
给我这个点缀的高斯曲线，它扩展了我们的高斯曲线领域，
the probability of P of X and that will give me this dotted Gaussian which is

1802
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,700
给我这个点缀的高斯曲线，它扩展了我们的高斯曲线领域，
give me this dotted Gaussian which is the expanding our field of Gaussian that

1803
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:52,710
给我这个点缀的高斯曲线，它扩展了我们的高斯曲线领域，
the expanding our field of Gaussian that has a mean basically that is given by

1804
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:55,760
基本上有一个平均值，就是这个值给定的，所以
the expanding our field of Gaussian that has a mean basically that is given by

1805
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:02,540
基本上有一个平均值，就是这个值给定的，所以
has a mean basically that is given by this value here okay so how does the

1806
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:02,550
基本上有一个平均值，就是这个值给定的，所以
this value here okay so how does the linearization look like so for example

1807
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:04,970
线性化看起来像这样，例如这是您的观测顺序
this value here okay so how does the linearization look like so for example

1808
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:09,860
线性化看起来像这样，例如这是您的观测顺序
linearization look like so for example this is the observation order your

1809
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:09,870
线性化看起来像这样，例如这是您的观测顺序
this is the observation order your interest first on the table since the

1810
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:12,230
兴趣首先放在桌子上，因为这是值的问题，所以我们有H
this is the observation order your interest first on the table since the

1811
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:17,840
兴趣首先放在桌子上，因为这是值的问题，所以我们有H
interest first on the table since the question this is the value so we had H

1812
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:17,850
兴趣首先放在桌子上，因为这是值的问题，所以我们有H
question this is the value so we had H here right so we is the value is

1813
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:20,150
在这里正确，所以我们是根据先前的平均值计算得出的值，如果
question this is the value so we had H here right so we is the value is

1814
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:24,650
在这里正确，所以我们是根据先前的平均值计算得出的值，如果
here right so we is the value is computed at the previous mean okay if

1815
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:24,660
在这里正确，所以我们是根据先前的平均值计算得出的值，如果
computed at the previous mean okay if you remember this notation which is near

1816
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,150
您还记得这种表示法接近50减1是什么的主要
computed at the previous mean okay if you remember this notation which is near

1817
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:31,250
您还记得这种表示法接近50减1是什么的主要

01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:31,260
您还记得这种表示法接近50减1是什么的主要
50 minus 1 is the main of what distribution then this is the

1819
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:34,760
分布，那么这是观察上正确的，那么什么是TT
50 minus 1 is the main of what distribution then this is the

1820
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,820
分布，那么这是观察上正确的，那么什么是TT
distribution then this is the observationally right so what is mere TT

1821
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:37,830

observationally right so what is mere TT minus 1

1823
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,080
3-1之后通过此收集了多少数据，所以这是
observationally right so what is mere TT minus 1

1824
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:42,090
3-1之后通过此收集了多少数据，所以这是


1825
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:48,170

01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:53,220
有时看到正确的p加一些常数，所以常数是这个减去这次
so the constant is this minus this times that okay and of course here I'm

1857
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:56,510
没关系，当然我在这里想的是最吵的高斯音
so the constant is this minus this times that okay and of course here I'm

1979
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:17,520
高斯很明显，在我们的情况下，我们必须做两次，而你要做

2011
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:26,479
算法还是第一步，我们需要预测一个

2016
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:35,600
只有在t减去1好的情况下才向前进行观察，所以要这样做
distribution again right you first have to go one step ahead with observations

2017
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,310
只有在t减去1好的情况下才向前进行观察，所以要这样做

2018
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:40,320
只有在t减去1好的情况下才向前进行观察，所以要这样做
only after t minus 1 okay so to do this what we have to do is pass the previous

2019
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,840
我们要做的是通过先前的高斯分布
only after t minus 1 okay so to do this what we have to do is pass the previous

01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:46,560
我们要做的是通过先前的高斯分布
Gaussian distribution the Gaussian approximation we had for the filter and

2022
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,220
我们对CP的滤波和分布减去1的近似值

2023
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:51,770
我们对CP的滤波和分布减去1的近似值

2024
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:51,780
我们对CP的滤波和分布减去1的近似值
distribution of CP minus 1 so what you need to this first this through the

2025
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:54,439
首先需要通过定义运动学的函数G
distribution of CP minus 1 so what you need to this first this through the

2026
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:56,240
首先需要通过定义运动学的函数G
need to this first this through the function G that defines the kinematic

2027
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:56,250
首先需要通过定义运动学的函数G
function G that defines the kinematic model right the dynamical model G so

2028
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:59,720
正确的动力学模型G基本上是从这种下降开始的
function G that defines the kinematic model right the dynamical model G so

2029
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,290
正确的动力学模型G基本上是从这种下降开始的
model right the dynamical model G so basically start with this decline the

2030
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:03,300
正确的动力学模型G基本上是从这种下降开始的
basically start with this decline the Sigma points and then pass them to G and

2031
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,870
Sigma点，然后将它们传递给G，然后计算方差的平均值
basically start with this decline the Sigma points and then pass them to G and

2032
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:08,209
Sigma点，然后将它们传递给G，然后计算方差的平均值
Sigma points and then pass them to G and then to compute the mean of the variance

2033
01:14:08,209 --> 01:14:08,219
Sigma点，然后将它们传递给G，然后计算方差的平均值
then to compute the mean of the variance of that you weight them appropriately

2034
01:14:08,219 --> 01:14:11,590
其中，您可以使用
then to compute the mean of the variance of that you weight them appropriately

2035
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:13,570
其中，您可以使用
of that you weight them appropriately using the standard formulas from the

2036
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:13,580
其中，您可以使用
using the standard formulas from the insensitive small and you get the mean

2037
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:16,750
麻木不仁的小，您就可以得到波动率的平均值，并且
using the standard formulas from the insensitive small and you get the mean

2038
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:19,050
麻木不仁的小，您就可以得到波动率的平均值，并且
insensitive small and you get the mean of the volatility like that and

2039
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:19,060
麻木不仁的小，您就可以得到波动率的平均值，并且
of the volatility like that and eventually to genetic impedance of this

2040
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:25,080
最终成为该观察模型的遗传阻抗，但是是非线性的
of the volatility like that and eventually to genetic impedance of this

2041
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:28,330
最终成为该观察模型的遗传阻抗，但是是非线性的
eventually to genetic impedance of this observation model but is nonlinear okay

2042
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:28,340
最终成为该观察模型的遗传阻抗，但是是非线性的
observation model but is nonlinear okay so so what you need to miss you need to

2043
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:33,850
因此，您需要错过的事情需要传递Sigma T的强大功能
observation model but is nonlinear okay so so what you need to miss you need to

2044
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:37,300
因此，您需要错过的事情需要传递Sigma T的强大功能
so so what you need to miss you need to pass the power of Sigma T that we

2045
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:37,310
因此，您需要错过的事情需要传递Sigma T的强大功能
pass the power of Sigma T that we completed the previous step there is the

2046
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:40,690
完成了上一步，伦敦观察就好了，所以这就是
pass the power of Sigma T that we completed the previous step there is the

2047
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:43,840
完成了上一步，伦敦观察就好了，所以这就是
completed the previous step there is the observation London okay so this is what

2048
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:43,850
完成了上一步，伦敦观察就好了，所以这就是
observation London okay so this is what you get okay and then eventually you are

2049
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:50,050
你会好起来的，然后最终你将要拥有一种

you get okay and then eventually you are going to have this is sort of a

2051
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:54,500
你会好起来的，然后最终你将要拥有一种
going to have this is sort of a likelihood and this is sort of like a

2052
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,980
可能性，这有点像入门，所以您需要做
going to have this is sort of a likelihood and this is sort of like a

2053
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:59,680
可能性，这有点像入门，所以您需要做
likelihood and this is sort of like a primer so you're going to need to do the

2054
01:14:59,680 --> 01:14:59,690
可能性，这有点像入门，所以您需要做
primer so you're going to need to do the 2013 distribution you will need to use

2055
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:01,780
您需要使用贝叶斯规则和计算概率的2013年分布
