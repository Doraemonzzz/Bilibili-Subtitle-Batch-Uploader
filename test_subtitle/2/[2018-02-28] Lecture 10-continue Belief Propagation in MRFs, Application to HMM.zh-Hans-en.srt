00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:48,740
欢迎来到共和党图形模型的另一堂课，所以我们在总结
welcome to another class on Republican graphical models so we were summarizing

2
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:48,750
欢迎来到共和党图形模型的另一堂课，所以我们在总结
graphical models so we were summarizing basically an example of reduction three

3
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,870
基本上是归约三种算法的一个例子，所以在我讨论之前
graphical models so we were summarizing basically an example of reduction three

4
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,570
基本上是归约三种算法的一个例子，所以在我讨论之前
basically an example of reduction three algorithms so before I discussed the

5
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:53,580
基本上是归约三种算法的一个例子，所以在我讨论之前
algorithms so before I discussed the example once more I wanted to remind you

6
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,100
再次举例，我想提醒您的是
algorithms so before I discussed the example once more I wanted to remind you

7
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,030
再次举例，我想提醒您的是
example once more I wanted to remind you the message passing that is applied by

8
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,040
再次举例，我想提醒您的是
the message passing that is applied by the junction tree algorithm and there is

9
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,880
联结树算法，不幸的是，这里我可能没有原理图
the message passing that is applied by the junction tree algorithm and there is

10
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,040
联结树算法，不幸的是，这里我可能没有原理图
the junction tree algorithm and there is no unfortunately schematic here I may

11
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,050
联结树算法，不幸的是，这里我可能没有原理图
no unfortunately schematic here I may need to add the schematic but basically

12
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,980
需要添加原理图，但基本上我们有一个情况
no unfortunately schematic here I may need to add the schematic but basically

13
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,800
需要添加原理图，但基本上我们有一个情况
need to add the schematic but basically what we have is we have a situation

14
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:11,810
需要添加原理图，但基本上我们有一个情况
what we have is we have a situation where I have one you know one maximal

15
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:19,100
我有一个人，你知道一个最大的派系，我们称其为V到左边，
what we have is we have a situation where I have one you know one maximal

16
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,280
我有一个人，你知道一个最大的派系，我们称其为V到左边，
where I have one you know one maximal clique that we call it V to the left and

17
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,290
我有一个人，你知道一个最大的派系，我们称其为V到左边，
clique that we call it V to the left and another W to the right in between them

18
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,860
在它们之间右边的另一个W处，我们有分隔符s，所以这个想法是
clique that we call it V to the left and another W to the right in between them

19
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,800
在它们之间右边的另一个W处，我们有分隔符s，所以这个想法是
another W to the right in between them we have the separator s so the idea was

20
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:27,810
在它们之间右边的另一个W处，我们有分隔符s，所以这个想法是
we have the separator s so the idea was passing messages from V to W in a

21
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,130
从V到W向前传递消息，此等式位于顶部
we have the separator s so the idea was passing messages from V to W in a

22
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,260
从V到W向前传递消息，此等式位于顶部
passing messages from V to W in a forward manner this equation on the top

23
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,270
从V到W向前传递消息，此等式位于顶部
forward manner this equation on the top and then on reversed passing messages

24
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,010
然后反向通过分隔符将消息从W传递回我
forward manner this equation on the top and then on reversed passing messages

25
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,750
然后反向通过分隔符将消息从W传递回我
and then on reversed passing messages from W back to me through the separator

26
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:40,760
然后反向通过分隔符将消息从W传递回我
from W back to me through the separator so I want to review with you the

27
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,920
因此，我想与您一起审查问题，以便我们尝试查看此问题
from W back to me through the separator so I want to review with you the

28
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,280
因此，我想与您一起审查问题，以便我们尝试查看此问题
so I want to review with you the question so then we will try to see this

29
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,290
因此，我想与您一起审查问题，以便我们尝试查看此问题
question so then we will try to see this in a very specific example on what

30
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,060
在一个非常具体的示例中，我们将详细说明如果您尝试这样做的话
question so then we will try to see this in a very specific example on what

31
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,630
在一个非常具体的示例中，我们将详细说明如果您尝试这样做的话
in a very specific example on what exactly we tried to do so if you

32
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:53,640
在一个非常具体的示例中，我们将详细说明如果您尝试这样做的话
exactly we tried to do so if you remember the separator involves the

33
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,340
记住分隔符涉及两个V共同的变量
exactly we tried to do so if you remember the separator involves the

34
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,050
记住分隔符涉及两个V共同的变量
remember the separator involves the variables that they are common to both V

35
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,060
记住分隔符涉及两个V共同的变量
variables that they are common to both V and W so obviously to show me initially

36
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,190
和W显然是为了告诉我最初将分隔器电位初始化为1
variables that they are common to both V and W so obviously to show me initially

37
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,100
和W显然是为了告诉我最初将分隔器电位初始化为1
and W so obviously to show me initially initialize the separator potentials to 1

38
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,110
和W显然是为了告诉我最初将分隔器电位初始化为1
initialize the separator potentials to 1 ok so obviously to update the separator

39
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,050
好，很显然，要更新分离器的潜力，我们必须整合所有
initialize the separator potentials to 1 ok so obviously to update the separator

40
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,030
好，很显然，要更新分离器的潜力，我们必须整合所有
ok so obviously to update the separator potentials we have to integrate out all

41
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:11,040
好，很显然，要更新分离器的潜力，我们必须整合所有
potentials we have to integrate out all the volume Wilson V except the very much

42
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,730
音量Wilson V除外，除了分离器中的很大部分，所以Ross V小调
potentials we have to integrate out all the volume Wilson V except the very much

43
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,330
音量Wilson V除外，除了分离器中的很大部分，所以Ross V小调
the volume Wilson V except the very much in the separator right so Ross V minor

44
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:17,340
音量Wilson V除外，除了分离器中的很大部分，所以Ross V小调
in the separator right so Ross V minor says they are not relevant information

45
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,720
说它们不是与W相关的信息，所以我们必须将它们集成到一起
in the separator right so Ross V minor says they are not relevant information

46
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,910
说它们不是与W相关的信息，所以我们必须将它们集成到一起
says they are not relevant information for W so we have to integrate them out

47
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:22,920
说它们不是与W相关的信息，所以我们必须将它们集成到一起
for W so we have to integrate them out so this is pissed R subscript s means

48
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,010
所以这很生气R下标s表示分隔器的电位是
for W so we have to integrate them out so this is pissed R subscript s means

49
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,940
所以这很生气R下标s表示分隔器的电位是
so this is pissed R subscript s means the potential of the separator is this

50
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:30,950
所以这很生气R下标s表示分隔器的电位是
the potential of the separator is this then we go to W and we update the

51
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,030
然后我们转到W，然后更新最大派系W的势
the potential of the separator is this then we go to W and we update the

52
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,330
然后我们转到W，然后更新最大派系W的势
then we go to W and we update the potential of the maximal clique W by

53
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:38,340
然后我们转到W，然后更新最大派系W的势
potential of the maximal clique W by multiplying by this factor of the

54
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,720
乘以更新的分隔器电位的该因子除以

56
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:43,980
乘以更新的分隔器电位的该因子除以

58
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,159
原始分隔符的潜力，显然在您启动算法时

59
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:47,169
原始分隔符的潜力，显然在您启动算法时
obviously when you start the algorithm first is equal to one in the process

60
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:51,059
首先等于一个，在我们一直被征税的过程中，确实很棒

61
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,769
首先等于一个，在我们一直被征税的过程中，确实很棒

62
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:52,779
首先等于一个，在我们一直被征税的过程中，确实很棒
we've been tax really great so the objective just to be consistent

63
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:55,290
所以目标是保持一致，因为所有事物都有一颗恒星
we've been tax really great so the objective just to be consistent

64
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,659
所以目标是保持一致，因为所有事物都有一颗恒星
so the objective just to be consistent because everything has one star the

65
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:57,669
所以目标是保持一致，因为所有事物都有一颗恒星
because everything has one star the updated cyber cyber star is equal to

71
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:16,060
现在正在将消息从W传播回V
messages from W back to V so we are going to update the separator potential

72
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,929
将以W和W的电势开始更新分隔器电势
messages from W back to V so we are going to update the separator potential

00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
鉴于Q 1如此有效，我的联合分布看起来又像这样
distribution that looks like this again we're going to give you a risk

我们将为您提供有关此模型是什么的风险解释
interpretation on what this model is good right in starting today basically

249
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:20,700
从今天开始的好权利，基本上也许是我们达成此目标的借口

00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,960
从今天开始的好权利，基本上也许是我们达成此目标的借口
good right in starting today basically maybe the excuse that we reach this

251
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:22,970
从今天开始的好权利，基本上也许是我们达成此目标的借口
maybe the excuse that we reach this point but the for now the Joint

252
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,930
要点，但目前联合分配基本上是
maybe the excuse that we reach this point but the for now the Joint

253
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,040
要点，但目前联合分配基本上是
point but the for now the Joint Distribution is basically this is a

254
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,050
要点，但目前联合分配基本上是
Distribution is basically this is a directed graph is where you start right

255
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,460
有向图是您正确开始的地方，是初始状态的概率
Distribution is basically this is a directed graph is where you start right

256
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,430
有向图是您正确开始的地方，是初始状态的概率
directed graph is where you start right and the probability of the initial state

257
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:36,440
有向图是您正确开始的地方，是初始状态的概率
and the probability of the initial state and then you have the probability of for

258
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,860
然后您可以根据状态获得预留装载程序的可能性
and the probability of the initial state and then you have the probability of for

259
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,610

and then you have the probability of for reservation loaders given the state

260
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:41,620
然后您可以根据状态获得预留装载程序的可能性
reservation loaders given the state which we take them to be independent

261
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,230
我们认为他们是独立的好，所以考虑到Q，这些妻子是

262
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,870
我们认为他们是独立的好，所以考虑到Q，这些妻子是

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
我们认为他们是独立的好，所以考虑到Q，这些妻子是
okay so given Q these wives are independent and the independence comes

264
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,560
独立性，独立性来自于这种分离你可以看到y
okay so given Q these wives are independent and the independence comes

265
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,769
独立性，独立性来自于这种分离你可以看到y
independent and the independence comes from this separation you can see that y

266
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:53,779
独立性，独立性来自于这种分离你可以看到y
from this separation you can see that y 0 to the end of y 1 given this state

267
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:56,350
0到y 1的末尾给定此状态，因为如果按照这种方式运行，则为
from this separation you can see that y 0 to the end of y 1 given this state

books rather than being given by this Joint Distribution is really the

500
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,360
给定y 0到YT，联合分布实际上是QT的后验，所以
books rather than being given by this Joint Distribution is really the

501
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,890
给定y 0到YT，联合分布实际上是QT的后验，所以
Joint Distribution is really the posterior of QT given y 0 to Y T so

502
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:37,900
给定y 0到YT，联合分布实际上是QT的后验，所以

00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:58,580
您用于此的临床医生，如果它等于与i成正比的i4
equal to i4 proportional to alpha you get the same equation so that should not

515
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,640
得到相同的等式，所以这不应该成为问题，所以让我给你，让我
equal to i4 proportional to alpha you get the same equation so that should not

523
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,280
讨论有关隐马尔可夫模型的问题，这是板块-数量还可以
is the plate for this - quantity ok the Alpha message so the calculator time T

524
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,730
Alpha消息，因此您需要知道Alfred的计算器时间T加1 alpha

plus 1 alpha you require to know Alfred time QT and so you know this is

527
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,320
时间QT，所以您知道这基本上是前向递归
plus 1 alpha you require to know Alfred time QT and so you know this is

528
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,300
时间QT，所以您知道这基本上是前向递归
time QT and so you know this is basically a forward recursive

529
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:31,310
时间QT，所以您知道这基本上是前向递归
basically a forward recursive calculation so you start from time 0 you

530
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,210
计算，因此您可以从时间0开始计算主时间t1，
basically a forward recursive calculation so you start from time 0 you

531
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,520
计算，因此您可以从时间0开始计算主时间t1，

543
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,930
原则上与这个结合在一起，您将得到与变化相同的等式，

00:21:59,930 --> 00:21:59,940
原则上与这个结合在一起，您将得到与变化相同的等式，
get the same equation as for change and some words actually we don't want to

545
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,840
实际上我们不想将某些单词视为它们合并的新问题

treat this as a new problem they merge the evolution equations the dynamics to

548
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,810
演化方程将动力学模型转化为观测模型，这样他们就可以

checks but sort of here it's nicely written okay because you explicitly see

554
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,550
写得还好，因为您明确看到了观察模型，并且
checks but sort of here it's nicely written okay because you explicitly see

00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:25,370
写得还好，因为您明确看到了观察模型，并且
written okay because you explicitly see the the observation model and and also

556
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:25,380
写得还好，因为您明确看到了观察模型，并且
the the observation model and and also of this transition probabilities from

557
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,680
从状态T到T的过渡概率加上1好的，所以这是
the the observation model and and also of this transition probabilities from

558
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,890
从状态T到T的过渡概率加上1好的，所以这是

559
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:30,900
从状态T到T的过渡概率加上1好的，所以这是
state T to T plus 1 okay so this is the forward recursive equation for finding

560
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,290
寻找阿尔法的前向递归方程现在是贝塔弄乱了它
state T to T plus 1 okay so this is the forward recursive equation for finding

寻找阿尔法的前向递归方程现在是贝塔弄乱了它
forward recursive equation for finding alpha this is now the beta messes it

alpha this is now the beta messes it comes to look like that and you notice

563
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,570
看起来像这样，您会注意到计算出来的，因为QT我们不需要
alpha this is now the beta messes it comes to look like that and you notice

00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,030
看起来像这样，您会注意到计算出来的，因为QT我们不需要

00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,040
看起来像这样，您会注意到计算出来的，因为QT我们不需要
the calculated because QT we need not be the QT plus one so this is a bad word

566
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,400
QT加一，所以这是一个不好的单词方程式，当您经常
the calculated because QT we need not be the QT plus one so this is a bad word

567
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,690
QT加一，所以这是一个不好的单词方程式，当您经常
the QT plus one so this is a bad word equation and when you have made often

将其定义为y的观测值y 0的概率为0
0 times the observation of y 0 given to 0 so really this is the Joint

704
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:40,879
0所以这真的是Q 0 y 0的联合分布
0 times the observation of y 0 given to 0 so really this is the Joint

705
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:44,200

706
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,210
0所以这真的是Q 0 y 0的联合分布
Distribution of Q 0 y 0 you see that I mean a time 0 right I'm gonna have I'm

707
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:47,330
意思是时间0对，我要开始，我要采样到0

going to start I'm going to sample to 0 from the initial distribution P of Q 0

710
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,659
从Q 0的初始分布P开始，然后赋予0，那么我要

711
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:56,360
从Q 0的初始分布P开始，然后赋予0，那么我要
from the initial distribution P of Q 0 and then given to 0 then I'm going to

712
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,370
从Q 0的初始分布P开始，然后赋予0，那么我要
and then given to 0 then I'm going to say what's the probability of y 0 given

713
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,759
说y 0赋予0的概率是多少，所以我将这两件事放在一起
and then given to 0 then I'm going to say what's the probability of y 0 given

714
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,590
说y 0赋予0的概率是多少，所以我将这两件事放在一起
say what's the probability of y 0 given to 0 so I put the two things together

715
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:00,600
说y 0赋予0的概率是多少，所以我将这两件事放在一起
to 0 so I put the two things together and I define them as this potential okay

716
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,820
我把它们定义为这种潜在的好处，只是为了使事情变得容易，所以我的交界处
to 0 so I put the two things together and I define them as this potential okay

717
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,240
我把它们定义为这种潜在的好处，只是为了使事情变得容易，所以我的交界处
and I define them as this potential okay just to make things easy so my junction

718
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,250
我把它们定义为这种潜在的好处，只是为了使事情变得容易，所以我的交界处
just to make things easy so my junction 3 loops I gotten and what you also see

719
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,629
我得到了3个循环，您还看到的是在这里可以看到的分隔符

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,940
这两个节点和一个共同点是0这两个知识得到
these two nodes and one thing in common which is to 0 these two knowledge get

724
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:19,950
这两个节点和一个共同点是0这两个知识得到
which is to 0 these two knowledge get one thing in common which is Q 1 so I

725
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,580
一个共同点是Q 1，所以我给了很多不同的希腊符号
which is to 0 these two knowledge get one thing in common which is Q 1 so I

726
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,350
一个共同点是Q 1，所以我给了很多不同的希腊符号
one thing in common which is Q 1 so I give different a lots of Greek symbols

727
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:24,360
一个共同点是Q 1，所以我给了很多不同的希腊符号
give different a lots of Greek symbols here if you can pronounce them from

728
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,170
在这里，如果您可以说出它们的意思，您将获得额外的奖励积分
give different a lots of Greek symbols here if you can pronounce them from

729
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,660
在这里，如果您可以说出它们的意思，您将获得额外的奖励积分
here if you can pronounce them from you're gonna get an extra bonus point in

730
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:29,670
在这里，如果您可以说出它们的意思，您将获得额外的奖励积分
you're gonna get an extra bonus point in your homework by Subic okay so this is

731
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:35,050
苏比克（Subic）的功课还好，所以这又是关于Q等的Q对P的问题
you're gonna get an extra bonus point in your homework by Subic okay so this is

732
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:40,940
苏比克（Subic）的功课还好，所以这又是关于Q等的Q对P的问题
your homework by Subic okay so this is again Q to P of Q on etcetera

733
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,810
因此，我们通过这种潜力介绍这些权利是这些过渡
your homework by Subic okay so this is again Q to P of Q on etcetera

734
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:44,820
因此，我们通过这种潜力介绍这些权利是这些过渡


735
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:53,420
因此，我们通过这种潜力介绍这些权利是这些过渡
so so we introduce this right through this potentials are these transition

736
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:53,430
因此，我们通过这种潜力介绍这些权利是这些过渡
this potentials are these transition probabilities these are the observation

737
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,360
这些概率都是观察模型，所以我们初始化所有
this potentials are these transition probabilities these are the observation

738
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,060
这些概率都是观察模型，所以我们初始化所有
probabilities these are the observation models all right so we initialize all

739
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,070
这些概率都是观察模型，所以我们初始化所有
models all right so we initialize all the potentials to one right so we start

740
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,490
潜能正确，所以我们开始将所有潜能都称为
models all right so we initialize all the potentials to one right so we start

741
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,770
潜能正确，所以我们开始将所有潜能都称为
the potentials to one right so we start we put every potential to be called

742
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:03,780
潜能正确，所以我们开始将所有潜能都称为
we put every potential to be called every separator to be the potential

743
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,110
每个可能的分隔符都等于1我必须等待
we put every potential to be called every separator to be the potential

744
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:11,990
每个可能的分隔符都等于1我必须等待
every separator to be the potential survives be equal to 1 I have to wait to

745
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,000
每个可能的分隔符都等于1我必须等待
survives be equal to 1 I have to wait to know what its life has right but don't

746
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,540
知道自己的生活是对的，但不要阅读，我们将对此进行解释
survives be equal to 1 I have to wait to know what its life has right but don't

747
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,450
知道自己的生活是对的，但不要阅读，我们将对此进行解释
know what its life has right but don't read this and we will explain this

748
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:16,460

subside - auntie - alright can you tell me traumatically right so we don't need

770
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,250
我很受创伤，所以我们不需要基于联结树的问题
subside - auntie - alright can you tell me traumatically right so we don't need

771
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:17,630
我很受创伤，所以我们不需要基于联结树的问题

772
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:17,640
我很受创伤，所以我们不需要基于联结树的问题
the questions based on the junction tree algorithm so we start with one what is

773
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,540
算法，所以我们从一个开始，什么是新的分隔器电位，即
the questions based on the junction tree algorithm so we start with one what is

774
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,310
算法，所以我们从一个开始，什么是新的分隔器电位，即
algorithm so we start with one what is the new separator potential which is a

775
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:22,320
算法，所以我们从一个开始，什么是新的分隔器电位，即
the new separator potential which is a function of t2

776
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,040
t2的功能
the new separator potential which is a function of t2

777
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,480
我在计算机上看到了类似的东西，您知道那是什么，然后我去了
the new separator potential which is a function of t2

778
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:26,490
我在计算机上看到了类似的东西，您知道那是什么，然后我去了


779
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,980

I see something on the computers like that you know it was like and I went to

780
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:30,990
我在计算机上看到了类似的东西，您知道那是什么，然后我去了
that you know it was like and I went to some high place they don't like myself

781
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,330
他们不喜欢自己的杯子的高处，你知道吗，所以一定是一些东西
that you know it was like and I went to some high place they don't like myself

782
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,509
他们不喜欢自己的杯子的高处，你知道吗，所以一定是一些东西
some high place they don't like myself cup you know right so must be something

783
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:35,519
他们不喜欢自己的杯子的高处，你知道吗，所以一定是一些东西
cup you know right so must be something like that everything is in the computer

784
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,070
就像一切都在电脑里一样，所以这就是为什么我不会
cup you know right so must be something like that everything is in the computer

785
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,700
就像一切都在电脑里一样，所以这就是为什么我不会
like that everything is in the computer all right so that's why I'm not gonna be

786
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:43,710
就像一切都在电脑里一样，所以这就是为什么我不会
all right so that's why I'm not gonna be posting anything anymore you know it's

787
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,680
发布任何东西，你知道这太累了，试试这血，那是什么
all right so that's why I'm not gonna be posting anything anymore you know it's

788
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,889
发布任何东西，你知道这太累了，试试这血，那是什么
posting anything anymore you know it's too tiring try this blood so what is

789
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:48,899
发布任何东西，你知道这太累了，试试这血，那是什么
too tiring try this blood so what is that benefit separate the potential you

790
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:55,879
好处将您记住的潜力分离出来，找到了更新后的潜力
too tiring try this blood so what is that benefit separate the potential you

791
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:57,799
好处将您记住的潜力分离出来，找到了更新后的潜力
that benefit separate the potential you remember to find the updated potential

792
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:57,809
好处将您记住的潜力分离出来，找到了更新后的潜力
remember to find the updated potential maybe we have to do this potential here

793
00:30:57,809 --> 00:30:59,739
也许我们必须在这里发挥这种潜力，我们已经整合了什么
remember to find the updated potential maybe we have to do this potential here

794
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:02,330
也许我们必须在这里发挥这种潜力，我们已经整合了什么
maybe we have to do this potential here we have integrated with respect to what

795
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:02,340
也许我们必须在这里发挥这种潜力，我们已经整合了什么
we have integrated with respect to what variable at this point okay okay because

796
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:26,019
变量在这一点上好吧好吧，因为显然与连接树完全一样
we have integrated with respect to what variable at this point okay okay because

797
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:30,230
变量在这一点上好吧好吧，因为显然与连接树完全一样
variable at this point okay okay because clearly with exactly the junction tree

798
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,240

clearly with exactly the junction tree algorithm knows best

799
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,519
算法知道得最好，所以我们不正确，所以你告诉
clearly with exactly the junction tree algorithm knows best

800
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,039
算法知道得最好，所以我们不正确，所以你告诉
algorithm knows best so we don't otherwise right so you tell

801
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:34,049
算法知道得最好，所以我们不正确，所以你告诉
so we don't otherwise right so you tell me when I integrate this with respect to

802
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:35,690
当我将其相对于Y进行积分以更改相对值并告诉我时
so we don't otherwise right so you tell me when I integrate this with respect to

803
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,060
当我将其相对于Y进行积分以更改相对值并告诉我时
me when I integrate this with respect to Y to change the relative and tell me

804
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,070
当我将其相对于Y进行积分以更改相对值并告诉我时
Y to change the relative and tell me what that will give you

805
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,179
那会给你什么
Y to change the relative and tell me what that will give you

806
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:44,370
因此，当我整合这种潜力时，我们发现这种潜力就是尊重
Y to change the relative and tell me what that will give you

807
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:44,380
因此，当我整合这种潜力时，我们发现这种潜力就是尊重


808
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,180
因此，当我整合这种潜力时，我们发现这种潜力就是尊重
so when I integrate this potential we discover this potential is to respect to

809
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:48,190
因此，当我整合这种潜力时，我们发现这种潜力就是尊重
discover this potential is to respect to Y 2

810
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,289
Y 2 Z星是什么
discover this potential is to respect to Y 2

811
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:55,380

潜在的
what will the Z star be what is this potential

814
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:08,280
您必须重新考虑我们原来的问题吧
what will the Z star be what is this potential

815
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,290
您必须重新考虑我们原来的问题吧


816
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:11,990
您必须重新考虑我们原来的问题吧
you have to think again our original problem right

817
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,000
您必须重新考虑我们原来的问题吧
problem right what is that potential here here I can

818
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,730
这里的潜力是什么，我可以说是你的国王，所以当你
problem right what is that potential here here I can

819
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:26,370
这里的潜力是什么，我可以说是你的国王，所以当你
what is that potential here here I can say is it's the king of you so when you

820
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:26,380
这里的潜力是什么，我可以说是你的国王，所以当你
say is it's the king of you so when you named the greatest returns with respect

821
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,930
就巴里·马昂（Bhari maang）的成就命名为最大回报
say is it's the king of you so when you named the greatest returns with respect

822
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,180
就巴里·马昂（Bhari maang）的成就命名为最大回报
named the greatest returns with respect to what bhari maang

823
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,190
就巴里·马昂（Bhari maang）的成就命名为最大回报
to what bhari maang we said why son I'll observe right now

824
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,040
我们说了为什么儿子我现在要观察，所以有多少钱
to what bhari maang we said why son I'll observe right now

825
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:38,040
我们说了为什么儿子我现在要观察，所以有多少钱
we said why son I'll observe right now so with respect to how much is that so

826
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,050
我们说了为什么儿子我现在要观察，所以有多少钱
so with respect to how much is that so the separation potential then will not

827
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,100
那么分离的潜力就不会改变。
so with respect to how much is that so the separation potential then will not

828
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:47,310
那么分离的潜力就不会改变。
the separation potential then will not change all right how about this

829
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:47,320
那么分离的潜力就不会改变。
change all right how about this potential here so the message now from

830
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,100
潜力在这里，所以来自最高级的信息现在在那里
change all right how about this potential here so the message now from

831
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,960
潜力在这里，所以来自最高级的信息现在在那里
potential here so the message now from the superlative was in there

832
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:51,970
潜力在这里，所以来自最高级的信息现在在那里
the superlative was in there so we have made this form of this

833
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,760
因此，我们已经将这种形式的这种潜力变为可能
the superlative was in there so we have made this form of this

834
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,920
因此，我们已经将这种形式的这种潜力变为可能
so we have made this form of this potential will be there is a potential

835
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:55,930
因此，我们已经将这种形式的这种潜力变为可能
potential will be there is a potential times we have delegates of electric

836
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,290
时代我们有代表的电势除以原始
potential will be there is a potential times we have delegates of electric

时代我们有代表的电势除以原始
potential divided by the original potential separator potential which is

839
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,330
电位分离器的电位是相对运动，所以这个电位
potential divided by the original potential separator potential which is

840
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:06,000
电位分离器的电位是相对运动，所以这个电位
potential separator potential which is relative motion so this potential we

841
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,010
电位分离器的电位是相对运动，所以这个电位
relative motion so this potential we should not say so when messages with

842
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:10,410
当有智慧的讯息被观察时，不应该这样说。
relative motion so this potential we should not say so when messages with

843
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,750
当有智慧的讯息被观察时，不应该这样说。
should not say so when messages with wise being an observed when messages are

00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,680
百老汇联合还好吧，原因可能与联合圈有关
joint okay Broadway so the reason potentially with the joint circle

885
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:55,690
百老汇联合还好吧，原因可能与联合圈有关
potentially with the joint circle integrative respect to y 0 you get P of

886
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:58,740
相对于y 0的综合方面，您得到Q 0的P，因此立即您可以看到
potentially with the joint circle integrative respect to y 0 you get P of

887
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,070
相对于y 0的综合方面，您得到Q 0的P，因此立即您可以看到

888
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,080
相对于y 0的综合方面，您得到Q 0的P，因此立即您可以看到
Q 0 so immediately you can see that this peak potential becomes a marginal so

889
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,060
峰值电势变得微不足道，所以突然有意思了
Q 0 so immediately you can see that this peak potential becomes a marginal so

890
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,670
峰值电势变得微不足道，所以突然有意思了
peak potential becomes a marginal so suddenly has a meaning it's nothing else

891
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:08,680
峰值电势变得微不足道，所以突然有意思了
suddenly has a meaning it's nothing else but the marginal of to 0 so let's see

892
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:15,540
但边际为0，所以让我们看看发生了什么事，道具过时了
suddenly has a meaning it's nothing else but the marginal of to 0 so let's see

893
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,420
但边际为0，所以让我们看看发生了什么事，道具过时了
but the marginal of to 0 so let's see what's going to happen the prop dated we

894
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:18,430
但边际为0，所以让我们看看发生了什么事，道具过时了
what's going to happen the prop dated we will take the or potential which is the

895
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,780
将采用或电位，即您被赋予0的概率，而这
what's going to happen the prop dated we will take the or potential which is the

896
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,090
将采用或电位，即您被赋予0的概率，而这
will take the or potential which is the probability you are given to 0 and this

897
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:24,100
将采用或电位，即您被赋予0的概率，而这
probability you are given to 0 and this we told is the marginal so this this

898
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,070
我们说的是边际，所以这个产品是进行QR的联合，所以
probability you are given to 0 and this we told is the marginal so this this

899
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:30,090
我们说的是边际，所以这个产品是进行QR的联合，所以
we told is the marginal so this this product is the joint of proceeding QR so

900
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:30,100
我们说的是边际，所以这个产品是进行QR的联合，所以
product is the joint of proceeding QR so the clinic potentials now become

901
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,380
现在诊所的潜力变得微不足道了，所以也许我应该打电话给
product is the joint of proceeding QR so the clinic potentials now become

902
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,940
现在诊所的潜力变得微不足道了，所以也许我应该打电话给
the clinic potentials now become marginal social so maybe I should call

903
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:37,950
现在诊所的潜力变得微不足道了，所以也许我应该打电话给
marginal social so maybe I should call this potential now becomes 2 marginally

904
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,890
这个潜力现在变成2也许这成为当我们记住的时候
marginal social so maybe I should call this potential now becomes 2 marginally

905
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:48,780
这个潜力现在变成2也许这成为当我们记住的时候
this potential now becomes 2 marginally maybe this becomes a remember when we

906
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:48,790
这个潜力现在变成2也许这成为当我们记住的时候
maybe this becomes a remember when we said that the joint probability

907
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,640
说联合概率分布是
maybe this becomes a remember when we said that the joint probability

908
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,359
说联合概率分布是
said that the joint probability distribution is the product of the

909
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:54,369
说联合概率分布是
distribution is the product of the maximal clique potentials divided by the

910
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:56,250
您可以实际看到最大的集团势除以分隔符吗

912
00:35:59,099 --> 00:35:59,109
您可以实际看到最大的集团势除以分隔符吗
separators can you actually visualize now about what because it first becomes

913
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:02,400
现在关于什么，因为它首先变成了边缘，所以另一个变成了
separators can you actually visualize now about what because it first becomes

914
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,950
现在关于什么，因为它首先变成了边缘，所以另一个变成了
now about what because it first becomes this marginal so the other one to become

915
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:04,960
现在关于什么，因为它首先变成了边缘，所以另一个变成了
this marginal so the other one to become the submariners maybe that works really

916
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,380
潜艇也许真的很好，你们可以做代数，
this marginal so the other one to become the submariners maybe that works really

917
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,859
潜艇也许真的很好，你们可以做代数，
the submariners maybe that works really okay and you can guys do the algebra and

918
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:13,869
潜艇也许真的很好，你们可以做代数，
okay and you can guys do the algebra and you can see that which works fine

919
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:18,810
您可以看到效果很好
okay and you can guys do the algebra and you can see that which works fine

920
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:19,620
因此，当您从这里向那里发送消息，然后从那里向

948
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,800
敏锐变成0现在你说变成纯P是指这个
potential list is P of Q 0 Q 1 so 0 0 of acumen becomes what becomes a 0 now do

949
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,480
敏锐变成0现在你说变成纯P是指这个
acumen becomes what becomes a 0 now do you say becomes P of pure refers to this

950
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:34,490
敏锐变成0现在你说变成纯P是指这个
you say becomes P of pure refers to this potential originally because you never

951
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:41,170
最初的潜力，因为您从不改变如果您扭转了
you say becomes P of pure refers to this potential originally because you never

952
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,020
最初的潜力，因为您从不改变如果您扭转了
potential originally because you never changed what if you reverse the

953
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,030
最初的潜力，因为您从不改变如果您扭转了
changed what if you reverse the probability of y 1 given Q 1 x now the

954
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:47,530
在给定Q 1 x的情况下y 1的概率现在将开始的新势Z
changed what if you reverse the probability of y 1 given Q 1 x now the

955
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,570
在给定Q 1 x的情况下y 1的概率现在将开始的新势Z
probability of y 1 given Q 1 x now the new potential Z that will start and we

956
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:49,580
在给定Q 1 x的情况下y 1的概率现在将开始的新势Z
new potential Z that will start and we told me was what B if you are divided by

957
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:53,349
告诉我，如果您将B除以1，那么B是什么，所以新的电势将是
new potential Z that will start and we told me was what B if you are divided by

958
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:56,620
告诉我，如果您将B除以1，那么B是什么，所以新的电势将是
told me was what B if you are divided by 1 so the new potential is going to be

959
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:56,630
告诉我，如果您将B除以1，那么B是什么，所以新的电势将是
1 so the new potential is going to be what now

960
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,109
现在怎么办
1 so the new potential is going to be what now

961
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:00,980
很容易是纯白人女性q1然后乘以P
1 so the new potential is going to be what now

962
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:00,990
很容易是纯白人女性q1然后乘以P


963
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:07,430
很容易是纯白人女性q1然后乘以P
so easily it was pure white women q1 and then you multiplied by P a few ones so

964
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:07,440

成为武库，然后有效地使分隔符变成她的边缘，甚至
become arsenals and then effectively the separators becomes her marginal or even

973
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:33,330
成为武库，然后有效地使分隔符变成她的边缘，甚至
separators becomes her marginal or even you may say what's going on where is the

974
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,570
您可能会说发生了什么事，另一个消息在哪里，更大的消息在哪里？
separators becomes her marginal or even you may say what's going on where is the

将信息从该节点分发给子节点，因此我们应用了
distribute the information from this node to the children so we applied the

1000
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:22,260
将信息从该节点分发给子节点，因此我们应用了
node to the children so we applied the separators alright so we calculate the

1001
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,400
好的分隔符，所以我们以之前和之前的方式计算分隔符
node to the children so we applied the separators alright so we calculate the

好的分隔符，所以我们以之前和之前的方式计算分隔符
separators alright so we calculate the separators the way we did before and

1003
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,150
好的分隔符，所以我们以之前和之前的方式计算分隔符
separators the way we did before and then we multiplied with the double style

1004
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,560
然后我们用双重风格相乘，我们试图更新潜力
separators the way we did before and then we multiplied with the double style

1005
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,540

00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:45,700
QT减1到PP，所以实际上当您将这两个变量整合到一起时
integrate these two variables out on this final update of size star you can

1205
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,690
这颗恒星的最后更新，您可以获得前锋的边际能力
integrate these two variables out on this final update of size star you can

1206
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,910

00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,850
好的计算就可以了
get the marginal aptitude with a forward calculation ok

1209
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:56,670
好的计算就可以了
calculation ok so effectively the calculation of the

1210
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:56,680
好的计算就可以了
so effectively the calculation of the marginal likelihood from the calculation

1211
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,640
计算使它们变得明显复杂的边际可能性
so effectively the calculation of the marginal likelihood from the calculation

1212

distribution is equal to this where instead of 1 I have 1 plus tau

1574
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:22,079
分配等于此，而不是1我有1加tau
instead of 1 I have 1 plus tau sort of - 2 plus tau etc so basically as

1575
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,789
有点-2加tau等，所以基本上当我用tau拉伸整个东西时，我可以
instead of 1 I have 1 plus tau sort of - 2 plus tau etc so basically as

1576
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:28,490
有点-2加tau等，所以基本上当我用tau拉伸整个东西时，我可以
sort of - 2 plus tau etc so basically as I stretch the whole thing by tau I can

1577
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:28,500
有点-2加tau等，所以基本上当我用tau拉伸整个东西时，我可以
I stretch the whole thing by tau I can still get the same joint cumulative

1578
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,650
仍然获得相同的联合累积分布函数
I stretch the whole thing by tau I can still get the same joint cumulative

您提交了整篇论文，但这是计算机助手，我相信
and you submit a whole paper but it's a computer mate right and and I am sure

1622
01:03:09,799 --> 01:03:09,809
您提交了整篇论文，但这是计算机助手，我相信
computer mate right and and I am sure lots of people do that ok this day so

1623
01:03:09,809 --> 01:03:13,640
今天很多人都会这样做，所以有趣的是，如果您使用的是Mac
computer mate right and and I am sure lots of people do that ok this day so

1624
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:17,539
今天很多人都会这样做，所以有趣的是，如果您使用的是Mac
lots of people do that ok this day so that is interesting is if you use a Mac

1625
01:03:17,539 --> 01:03:17,549
今天很多人都会这样做，所以有趣的是，如果您使用的是Mac
that is interesting is if you use a Mac avianna function and the product rule

1626
01:03:17,549 --> 01:03:19,670
avianna功能和产品规则可以立即看到简化
that is interesting is if you use a Mac avianna function and the product rule

1627
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,980
avianna功能和产品规则可以立即看到简化
avianna function and the product rule you can see the immediate simplification

1628
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:21,990
avianna功能和产品规则可以立即看到简化
you can see the immediate simplification right so you can see here giving X 3

1629
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:25,730
正确，所以您可以在这里看到根据X 1和X 2给出X 3，您只有X
you can see the immediate simplification right so you can see here giving X 3

1630
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:28,039
正确，所以您可以在这里看到根据X 1和X 2给出X 3，您只有X
right so you can see here giving X 3 depending on X 1 and X 2 you have only X

1631
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:28,049
正确，所以您可以在这里看到根据X 1和X 2给出X 3，您只有X
depending on X 1 and X 2 you have only X 3 depending on X 2 X 2 and XT minus 12

3取决于X 2 X 2和XT减去12，因此您需要保留的变量
3 depending on X 2 X 2 and XT minus 12 so the variables that you need to keep

1634
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:34,170
3取决于X 2 X 2和XT减去12，因此您需要保留的变量
so the variables that you need to keep track of if each of this is

1635
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:37,550
跟踪这是否是同性恋价值观，您知道自己只有一个
so the variables that you need to keep track of if each of this is

1636
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:41,660
跟踪这是否是同性恋价值观，您知道自己只有一个
track of if each of this is gay values you know you only have just a

1637
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:41,670
跟踪这是否是同性恋价值观，您知道自己只有一个
gay values you know you only have just a stage for its XP this time matrices of

1638
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:44,660
这次，它的XP舞台上的K平方量级矩阵正确，所以这是
gay values you know you only have just a stage for its XP this time matrices of

1639
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:48,880
这次，它的XP舞台上的K平方量级矩阵正确，所以这是
stage for its XP this time matrices of the order of K square right so this is

1640
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:48,890
这次，它的XP舞台上的K平方量级矩阵正确，所以这是
the order of K square right so this is way much less complexity to be done it

1641
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:51,950
没有他们的马尔可夫假设就可以做到的复杂度要低得多
the order of K square right so this is way much less complexity to be done it

1642
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:56,800
没有他们的马尔可夫假设就可以做到的复杂度要低得多
way much less complexity to be done it without them Markovian assumption okay

1643
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:56,810
没有他们的马尔可夫假设就可以做到的复杂度要低得多
without them Markovian assumption okay [Applause]

1644
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:59,470
[鼓掌]所以我们确定这个问题是
without them Markovian assumption okay [Applause]

1645
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:04,820

01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:12,990
如果您明确表示参数化，那么我们假设
assume that but then the parameters to that model don't change with time okay

1653
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:15,350
该模型不会随着时间的推移而改变，通常来说，它试图计算

该模型中的参数无疑是一个琐碎的问题，所以您知道
and generally speaking trying to compute the parameters in this model is known as

1657
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,910
该模型中的参数无疑是一个琐碎的问题，所以您知道

certainly a trivial problem so you know when you have you try to model something

1659
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,890
例如，当您尝试使用马尔可夫链对某些事物进行建模时，如果
certainly a trivial problem so you know when you have you try to model something

1660
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:34,040
例如，当您尝试使用马尔可夫链对某些事物进行建模时，如果
when you have you try to model something with a Markov chain for example and if

01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:34,050
例如，当您尝试使用马尔可夫链对某些事物进行建模时，如果
with a Markov chain for example and if you make this amount I only distribution

1662
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:36,260
你使这个数额我只分配例如这样的东西，你知道
with a Markov chain for example and if you make this amount I only distribution

1663
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,300
你使这个数额我只分配例如这样的东西，你知道

你使这个数额我只分配例如这样的东西，你知道
for example something like that you know you are going to have a lot of unknowns

1665
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:40,580
在定义此分布时，您将有很多未知数，并且

1670
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:47,670
计算它们的唯一方法是使用数据，因此，如果您知道可以
data alright so if you know you can do much more active with estimation what as

1671
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:49,970
更加积极地估计我们认为通过EM实施的内容
data alright so if you know you can do much more active with estimation what as

更加积极地估计我们认为通过EM实施的内容
much more active with estimation what as we consider implemented through the EM

1673
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:53,340
更加积极地估计我们认为通过EM实施的内容
we consider implemented through the EM algorithm or maybe do a mapping but then

1674
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:56,210
算法，或者做一个映射，但是假设您从它开始，不，您

assume that you start with it no you have to learn this and then cook is not

1677
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,430
必须学习这一点，然后煮不是被老鼠的预测影响
assume that you start with it no you have to learn this and then cook is not

1678
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,010
必须学习这一点，然后煮不是被老鼠的预测影响
have to learn this and then cook is not being predictions influence of the rat

1679
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:04,020
必须学习这一点，然后煮不是被老鼠的预测影响
being predictions influence of the rat okay so we only assume that xn plus 1

1680
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:08,000
好吧，所以我们只假设xn加1个差分xn，但是您以哪种方式
being predictions influence of the rat okay so we only assume that xn plus 1

01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:40,410
脚本的状态，我们将其称为ALJ矩阵，然后
call this an ALJ matrix right and eventually we have to find some way to

1725
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:41,990
最终我们必须找到某种方法来从数据中进行计算，所以这有点

1733
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:57,000
概率电路，带有一些类似的示意图，因此您
schematic that looks like that so you know here there is a self transition

1734
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,780
知道这里有从状态1回到状态1的自转移概率

知道这里有从状态1回到状态1的自转移概率
probability from state 1 back to state 1 transition state 2 but no to state 3 and

1737
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:06,080
过渡状态2，但不过渡到状态3，并且在状态3中注意，基本上没有

01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:10,130
过渡状态2，但不过渡到状态3，并且在状态3中注意，基本上没有
transition state 2 but no to state 3 and notice in state 3 basically there is no

1739
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:10,140
过渡状态2，但不过渡到状态3，并且在状态3中注意，基本上没有
notice in state 3 basically there is no way you can escape because the

1740
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:11,360
您可以逃脱的方式，因为回到状态3的可能性是
notice in state 3 basically there is no way you can escape because the

1741
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,150
您可以逃脱的方式，因为回到状态3的可能性是
way you can escape because the probability of being back to state 3 is

1742
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:14,160
您可以逃脱的方式，因为回到状态3的可能性是
probability of being back to state 3 is 1 right so this is sort of an

1743
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,060
1对，所以在此图中，这是一个有趣的情况
probability of being back to state 3 is 1 right so this is sort of an

1744
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:20,090
1对，所以在此图中，这是一个有趣的情况
1 right so this is sort of an interesting case in this diagram you

1745
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:20,100
1对，所以在此图中，这是一个有趣的情况
interesting case in this diagram you will not be

1746
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:20,570
不会从三个逃脱然后回到一个
interesting case in this diagram you will not be

1747
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:24,590
不会从三个逃脱然后回到一个
will not be from three to escape and go back to one

1748
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:24,600
不会从三个逃脱然后回到一个
from three to escape and go back to one and two okay all right

1749
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:31,460
还有两个还好吧，所以在这种情况下的转移矩阵是
from three to escape and go back to one and two okay all right

1750
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:34,190
还有两个还好吧，所以在这种情况下的转移矩阵是
and two okay all right so the transition matrix in this case is

1751
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:34,200
还有两个还好吧，所以在这种情况下的转移矩阵是
so the transition matrix in this case is a 1 1 a 1 2 A 2 2 a 2 3 and 1

1752
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:38,560
a 1 1 a 1 2 A 2 2 a 2 3和1孔这是一个选择，而且更多

1753
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:42,920
a 1 1 a 1 2 A 2 2 a 2 3和1孔这是一个选择，而且更多
a 1 1 a 1 2 A 2 2 a 2 3 and 1 well that's a choice and more

1754
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:42,930
a 1 1 a 1 2 A 2 2 a 2 3和1孔这是一个选择，而且更多
well that's a choice and more interesting transition matrix square we

1755
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:45,800
有趣的过渡矩阵平方，我们可以进行自我过渡，所以这是

1756
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:50,150
有趣的过渡矩阵平方，我们可以进行自我过渡，所以这是
interesting transition matrix square we have self transition okay and so this is

1757
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:50,160
有趣的过渡矩阵平方，我们可以进行自我过渡，所以这是
have self transition okay and so this is best in transition from state 1 the

1758
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,670
从状态1过渡到地图1到状态2的最佳过渡
have self transition okay and so this is best in transition from state 1 the

1759
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:55,220
从状态1过渡到地图1到状态2的最佳过渡
best in transition from state 1 the first roll to map to state 1 state 2

01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:55,230
从状态1过渡到地图1到状态2的最佳过渡
first roll to map to state 1 state 2 state 3 so this probabilities have to

1761
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,320
状态3，因此此概率必须加起来为1，您会注意到每次损失该怎么办
first roll to map to state 1 state 2 state 3 so this probabilities have to

1762
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,650
状态3，因此此概率必须加起来为1，您会注意到每次损失该怎么办
state 3 so this probabilities have to sum to 1 you notice every loss how to do

1763
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:00,660
状态3，因此此概率必须加起来为1，您会注意到每次损失该怎么办
sum to 1 you notice every loss how to do one and in this case that say we are

1764
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,380
一个，在这种情况下，说我们歪曲了初始概率
sum to 1 you notice every loss how to do one and in this case that say we are

1765
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:06,980

01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:50,430
是的，非常好，非常好
write the software to do that so what do you have to do the first step

1808
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:50,440
是的，非常好，非常好


1809
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:56,460
是的，非常好，非常好
exactly yeah very good excellent

1810
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:56,609
我必须给出正确的反馈，所以他们认为我对课堂反应很好
exactly yeah very good excellent

1811
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:56,619
我必须给出正确的反馈，所以他们认为我对课堂反应很好


1812
01:09:56,619 --> 01:10:02,549
我必须给出正确的反馈，所以他们认为我对课堂反应很好
I have to give feedback right so they think am i responding to the class okay

1813
01:10:02,549 --> 01:10:02,559
我必须给出正确的反馈，所以他们认为我对课堂反应很好
think am i responding to the class okay so what do we do

1814
01:10:02,559 --> 01:10:05,250
那么我们该怎么办
think am i responding to the class okay so what do we do

1815
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:10,450
所以我们基本上必须从这个概率中选择一些要开始的东西，
think am i responding to the class okay so what do we do

1816
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:10,460
所以我们基本上必须从这个概率中选择一些要开始的东西，


1817
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:15,940
所以我们基本上必须从这个概率中选择一些要开始的东西，
so we basically have to select with this probabilities something to start and

1818
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:15,950
所以我们基本上必须从这个概率中选择一些要开始的东西，
probabilities something to start and then assuming that say we select the

1819
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:20,980
然后假设说我们选择第二种状态，那么我们将不得不
probabilities something to start and then assuming that say we select the

1820
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,620
然后假设说我们选择第二种状态，那么我们将不得不
then assuming that say we select the second state then we're going to have to

1821
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:23,630
然后假设说我们选择第二种状态，那么我们将不得不
second state then we're going to have to select with this probabilities to what's

1822
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:25,900
从这种可能性中选择从状态一开始的良好过渡，然后我们
second state then we're going to have to select with this probabilities to what's

1823
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:29,020
从这种可能性中选择从状态一开始的良好过渡，然后我们
select with this probabilities to what's a good transition from state one and we

1824
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:29,030
从这种可能性中选择从状态一开始的良好过渡，然后我们
a good transition from state one and we make transition with this to take one

1825
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:31,390
进行此过渡，以向后退以进入状态3的两个，并且
a good transition from state one and we make transition with this to take one

1826
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,340
进行此过渡，以向后退以进入状态3的两个，并且
make transition with this to take one backward to take two of state three and

1827
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:33,350
进行此过渡，以向后退以进入状态3的两个，并且
backward to take two of state three and then keep repeating this with the hope

1828
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:35,800
然后继续重复，希望在一天结束时我们能够
backward to take two of state three and then keep repeating this with the hope

1829
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,290
然后继续重复，希望在一天结束时我们能够
then keep repeating this with the hope that somehow at the end of the day we're

1830
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:38,300
然后继续重复，希望在一天结束时我们能够
that somehow at the end of the day we're gonna reach some stationary distribution

1831
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,580
会达到一些固定分布，我们将只介绍十二个
that somehow at the end of the day we're gonna reach some stationary distribution

1832
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:42,190
会达到一些固定分布，我们将只介绍十二个
gonna reach some stationary distribution and we will introduce twelve only one

1833
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:42,200
会达到一些固定分布，我们将只介绍十二个
and we will introduce twelve only one stationary distribution for this Markov

1834
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,500
这个马尔可夫链的平稳分布现在存在，你能告诉我我的意思吗？
and we will introduce twelve only one stationary distribution for this Markov

1835
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:51,520
这个马尔可夫链的平稳分布现在存在，你能告诉我我的意思吗？

这个马尔可夫链的平稳分布现在存在，你能告诉我我的意思吗？
chains exist now can you tell me I mean this is something we are keenly covered

1837
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:53,440
这是我们希望在讲座中涵盖的内容，希望也许是，但是如果

1838
01:10:53,440 --> 01:11:01,060
这是我们希望在讲座中涵盖的内容，希望也许是，但是如果
this is something we are keenly covered on lectures in hope maybe but if

1839
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:01,070
这是我们希望在讲座中涵盖的内容，希望也许是，但是如果
on lectures in hope maybe but if somebody gives you this distribution and

say sample from this distribution how do we do this how do something from a given

1843
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:10,000
我们这样做是如何根据给定的分布来做某事，而您知道自己是

1845
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:14,720
我们这样做是如何根据给定的分布来做某事，而您知道自己是

1848
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:21,530

from this can you tell exactly what will lead you to say among state for your

1849
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:23,260
引导您在州之间说出自己的状态

引导您在州之间说出自己的状态
lead you to say among state for your state to

1851
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:28,419
我们要上网吗
lead you to say among state for your state to

1852
01:11:28,419 --> 01:11:28,429
我们要上网吗


1853
01:11:28,429 --> 01:11:33,880
我们要上网吗
are we gonna do up in online

1854
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:42,569
因此，来自此分布的原始样本中的一些分布
are we gonna do up in online

1855
01:11:42,569 --> 01:11:42,579
因此，来自此分布的原始样本中的一些分布


1856
01:11:42,579 --> 01:11:47,909
因此，来自此分布的原始样本中的一些分布
so the original sample from this distribution some of the distribution

1857
01:11:47,909 --> 01:11:52,220
我的意思是你要如何从离散分布中采样
so the original sample from this distribution some of the distribution

1858
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:52,230
我的意思是你要如何从离散分布中采样


1859
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:56,080
我的意思是你要如何从离散分布中采样
I mean how do you sample from discrete distribution that's what I'm asking

1860
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:56,090
我的意思是你要如何从离散分布中采样
distribution that's what I'm asking that's the single thing to sample from

1861
01:11:56,090 --> 01:11:58,700
这是从离散分布中采样的唯一方法
distribution that's what I'm asking that's the single thing to sample from

1862
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:01,400
这是从离散分布中采样的唯一方法
that's the single thing to sample from discrete distribution

1863
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:08,939
看到制服上的东西，假设从零到一，如果是
that's the single thing to sample from discrete distribution

1864
01:12:08,939 --> 01:12:08,949
看到制服上的东西，假设从零到一，如果是


1865
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:14,850
看到制服上的东西，假设从零到一，如果是
see there's something from a uniform and let's say from zero to one and if it

1866
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:14,860
看到制服上的东西，假设从零到一，如果是
let's say from zero to one and if it happens to be let's say hi and then

1867
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:18,719
碰巧是打个招呼，然后指向六点六点或几点，然后您说
let's say from zero to one and if it happens to be let's say hi and then

1868
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:22,139
碰巧是打个招呼，然后指向六点六点或几点，然后您说
happens to be let's say hi and then point six six or something then you say

1869
01:12:22,139 --> 01:12:22,149
碰巧是打个招呼，然后指向六点六点或几点，然后您说
point six six or something then you say you are now on state three all right

1870
01:12:22,149 --> 01:12:26,279
如果您高于点，您现在同样处于状态三
point six six or something then you say you are now on state three all right

1871
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:28,169
如果您高于点，您现在同样处于状态三
you are now on state three all right similarly if you are higher than point

1872
01:12:28,169 --> 01:12:28,179
如果您高于点，您现在同样处于状态三
similarly if you are higher than point three three but less than that then your

1873
01:12:28,179 --> 01:12:30,959
三三，但比那少，那么你的状态2等好吧，这就是你的方式
similarly if you are higher than point three three but less than that then your

1874
01:12:30,959 --> 01:12:34,500
三三，但比那少，那么你的状态2等好吧，这就是你的方式
three three but less than that then your state 2 etc okay so this is how you

1875
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:34,510
三三，但比那少，那么你的状态2等好吧，这就是你的方式
state 2 etc okay so this is how you sample from discrete distribution since

1876
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:43,409
离散分布的样本，因为我们定义了该转移概率a
state 2 etc okay so this is how you sample from discrete distribution since

1877
01:12:43,409 --> 01:12:46,620
离散分布的样本，因为我们定义了该转移概率a
sample from discrete distribution since we defined this transition probability a

1878
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:46,630
离散分布的样本，因为我们定义了该转移概率a
we defined this transition probability a I J what we often use and the location

1879
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:50,370
IJ我们经常使用的位置也是该过渡的LJ
we defined this transition probability a I J what we often use and the location

1880
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:55,649
IJ我们经常使用的位置也是该过渡的LJ
I J what we often use and the location is also a LJ for this transition

1881
01:12:55,649 --> 01:12:55,659
IJ我们经常使用的位置也是该过渡的LJ
is also a LJ for this transition probability basically transition is from

1882
01:12:55,659 --> 01:12:57,899
基本上从I过渡到J的概率
is also a LJ for this transition probability basically transition is from

1883
01:12:57,899 --> 01:12:58,529
基本上从I过渡到J的概率
probability basically transition is from I to J

1884
01:12:58,529 --> 01:12:58,539
基本上从I过渡到J的概率
I to J but in n steps the idea being is that

1885
01:12:58,539 --> 01:13:01,979
但是在n步中，想法是您从时间T开始于状态I和之后的状态
I to J but in n steps the idea being is that

1886
01:13:01,979 --> 01:13:06,060
但是在n步中，想法是您从时间T开始于状态I和之后的状态
but in n steps the idea being is that you start at time T at state I and after

1887
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:06,070
但是在n步中，想法是您从时间T开始于状态I和之后的状态
you start at time T at state I and after n steps even and yourself in state Z so

1888
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:09,569
甚至n步并且您自己处于状态Z，所以这是N步过渡
you start at time T at state I and after n steps even and yourself in state Z so

1889
01:13:09,569 --> 01:13:10,469
甚至n步并且您自己处于状态Z，所以这是N步过渡
n steps even and yourself in state Z so this is the N step transition

1890
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:10,479
甚至n步并且您自己处于状态Z，所以这是N步过渡
this is the N step transition probability and effectively this

1891
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:13,399
概率并有效地满足了联邦方程，即
this is the N step transition probability and effectively this

1892
01:13:13,399 --> 01:13:17,399
概率并有效地满足了联邦方程，即
probability and effectively this satisfies the Commonwealth equation that

1893
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:17,409
概率并有效地满足了联邦方程，即
satisfies the Commonwealth equation that what you have seen it in many different

1894
01:13:17,409 --> 01:13:19,290
在本课程中，您在LD的许多不同背景中看到了什么，因此您可以
satisfies the Commonwealth equation that what you have seen it in many different

1895
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:23,339
在本课程中，您在LD的许多不同背景中看到了什么，因此您可以
what you have seen it in many different contexts in LD in this course so you can

1896
01:13:23,339 --> 01:13:23,349
在本课程中，您在LD的许多不同背景中看到了什么，因此您可以
contexts in LD in this course so you can think if you want transition in M plus n

1897
01:13:23,349 --> 01:13:27,060
想想如果您想在M加n的步骤中从I过渡到J，您能做的就是
contexts in LD in this course so you can think if you want transition in M plus n

1898
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:30,389
想想如果您想在M加n的步骤中从I过渡到J，您能做的就是
think if you want transition in M plus n steps from I to J that you can do is you

1899
01:13:30,389 --> 01:13:30,399
想想如果您想在M加n的步骤中从I过渡到J，您能做的就是
steps from I to J that you can do is you can transition them steps decay for a

1900
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:33,449
可以在可能的情况下将它们过渡为逐步衰减，然后在其余情况下
steps from I to J that you can do is you can transition them steps decay for a

1901
01:13:33,449 --> 01:13:35,729
可以在可能的情况下将它们过渡为逐步衰减，然后在其余情况下
can transition them steps decay for a possible case and then in the remaining

1902
01:13:35,729 --> 01:13:35,739
可以在可能的情况下将它们过渡为逐步衰减，然后在其余情况下
possible case and then in the remaining n steps transition from K today

1903
01:13:35,739 --> 01:13:37,739
今天从K过渡n步，所以英联邦方程基本上
possible case and then in the remaining n steps transition from K today

1904
01:13:37,739 --> 01:13:39,629
今天从K过渡n步，所以英联邦方程基本上
n steps transition from K today so the Commonwealth equation basically

1905
01:13:39,629 --> 01:13:39,639
今天从K过渡n步，所以英联邦方程基本上
so the Commonwealth equation basically looks like that ok and increased for

1906
01:13:39,639 --> 01:13:43,139
看起来不错，并为此增加，使您可以写出自己知道的n
so the Commonwealth equation basically looks like that ok and increased for

1907
01:13:43,139 --> 01:13:49,080
看起来不错，并为此增加，使您可以写出自己知道的n
looks like that ok and increased for this allows you to write you know this n

1908
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:49,090
看起来不错，并为此增加，使您可以写出自己知道的n
this allows you to write you know this n step transition matrix the way that you

1909
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:52,649
逐步过渡矩阵，就像您在这里看到的一样，所以不要
this allows you to write you know this n step transition matrix the way that you

1910
01:13:52,649 --> 01:13:57,689
逐步过渡矩阵，就像您在这里看到的一样，所以不要
step transition matrix the way that you see here okay so don't sort of the

1911
01:13:57,689 --> 01:13:57,699
逐步过渡矩阵，就像您在这里看到的一样，所以不要
see here okay so don't sort of the liberal interpretation of this because

1912
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:59,879
对此的自由解释，因为对此for的解释是
see here okay so don't sort of the liberal interpretation of this because

1913
01:13:59,879 --> 01:14:01,739
对此的自由解释，因为对此for的解释是
liberal interpretation of this because the interpretation of this for is

1914
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:01,749
对此的自由解释，因为对此for的解释是
the interpretation of this for is basically the Commonwealth equation that

1915
01:14:01,749 --> 01:14:03,449
基本上，那里的英联邦方程式
the interpretation of this for is basically the Commonwealth equation that

1916
01:14:03,449 --> 01:14:05,939
基本上，那里的英联邦方程式
basically the Commonwealth equation that which is there

1917
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:08,500
我认为这个问题很难解决，但是您可以在图片上看到
basically the Commonwealth equation that which is there

1918
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:08,510
我认为这个问题很难解决，但是您可以在图片上看到


1919
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:14,080
我认为这个问题很难解决，但是您可以在图片上看到
I think this problems are very difficult but you can see in on the picture on the

1920
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:14,090
我认为这个问题很难解决，但是您可以在图片上看到
but you can see in on the picture on the bottom for example that you know after a

1921
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:17,710
例如，您需要经过几个步骤才能知道底部，因为我们需要初始化
but you can see in on the picture on the bottom for example that you know after a

1922
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:19,210
例如，您需要经过几个步骤才能知道底部，因为我们需要初始化
bottom for example that you know after a few steps because we need to initialize

1923
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:19,220
例如，您需要经过几个步骤才能知道底部，因为我们需要初始化
few steps because we need to initialize things the state explored now depends on

1924
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:21,910
现在探索的状态取决于X 3但也取决于X 2和X 1因此
few steps because we need to initialize things the state explored now depends on

1925
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:25,150
现在探索的状态取决于X 3但也取决于X 2和X 1因此
things the state explored now depends on X 3 but also depends on X 2 and X 1 so

1926
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:25,160
现在探索的状态取决于X 3但也取决于X 2和X 1因此
X 3 but also depends on X 2 and X 1 so this is the Markov chain basically or

1927
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:29,530
这基本上是马尔可夫链，还是感谢流程，所以这有点
X 3 but also depends on X 2 and X 1 so this is the Markov chain basically or

1928
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:32,140
这基本上是马尔可夫链，还是感谢流程，所以这有点
this is the Markov chain basically or thanks flow so this is a way a little

1929
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:32,150
这基本上是马尔可夫链，还是感谢流程，所以这有点
thanks flow so this is a way a little bit more complicated problem and so you

1930
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:35,740
有点复杂的问题，所以您保持跟踪依赖基本上是
