1
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:40,690
all right this 1232 so let's part I am sure the rain is a

2
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:48,510
so let's part I am sure the rain is a factor on some not coming on time so

3
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,240
factor on some not coming on time so behind these lectures I thought that

4
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,400
behind these lectures I thought that hidden Markov models will work them in

5
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,570
hidden Markov models will work them in the past but based on at least questions

6
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,780
the past but based on at least questions I have from two of you I don't know why

7
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,730
I have from two of you I don't know why some kind of having picked up lots of

8
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,320
some kind of having picked up lots of the ideas because we already cover the

9
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,940
the ideas because we already cover the loss of the algorithms with hmm but

10
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,410
loss of the algorithms with hmm but maybe you only pick up ideas after the

11
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,660
maybe you only pick up ideas after the homework shall I assume you know you

12
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,949
homework shall I assume you know you have to work on the homework and then

13
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:20,729
have to work on the homework and then things are clear so anyways so I have to

14
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:23,020
things are clear so anyways so I have to spend maybe 10 mins to repeat some of

15
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,820
spend maybe 10 mins to repeat some of the things we discussed on the previous

16
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,850
the things we discussed on the previous lecture even though they were not very

17
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,850
lecture even though they were not very essential I mean not very difficulties

18
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:36,970
essential I mean not very difficulties so let me go back to 166 hopefully you

19
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,580
so let me go back to 166 hopefully you all got the slide so Vicki made

20
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,850
all got the slide so Vicki made everybody so when we discuss on

21
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,870
everybody so when we discuss on estimating the parameters of a hidden

22
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,040
estimating the parameters of a hidden Markov model from observations on the

23
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,960
Markov model from observations on the variables X so effectively we have to

24
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,430
variables X so effectively we have to compete with other parameter star on

25
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,159
compete with other parameter star on this initial distribution P of Z one of

26
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:03,580
this initial distribution P of Z one of these transition matrix in this

27
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,890
these transition matrix in this probability city given ZT minus 1 and

28
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,570
probability city given ZT minus 1 and whatever unknowns we have on the

29
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,360
whatever unknowns we have on the observation what oh I'm sorry on the

30
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,760
observation what oh I'm sorry on the yeah on the on the you know on the

31
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,219
yeah on the on the you know on the measurement distribution the the things

32
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:20,110
measurement distribution the the things that I basically covered on the last

33
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,450
that I basically covered on the last lecture are really independent of what

34
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,730
lecture are really independent of what type of distribution we assume for the

35
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,860
type of distribution we assume for the probability of XT given the hidden state

36
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,560
probability of XT given the hidden state so you can have a Gaussian and a multi

37
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,850
so you can have a Gaussian and a multi newly distribution you can they have

38
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,120
newly distribution you can they have whatever this sort of is generic and

39
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,040
whatever this sort of is generic and then you have to do something special

40
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,379
then you have to do something special about

41
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,230
about raising the parameters of the last term

42
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:49,860
raising the parameters of the last term okay simple statement serious you cannot

43
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,920
okay simple statement serious you cannot really go and integrate Z out because

44
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,559
really go and integrate Z out because that will require a massive calculation

45
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:58,260
that will require a massive calculation so what you need to do is you need to be

46
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,909
so what you need to do is you need to be able to estimate the parameters with the

47
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,830
able to estimate the parameters with the maximum likelihood sort of an estimate

48
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,960
maximum likelihood sort of an estimate you need to work with their expectation

49
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,369
you need to work with their expectation maximization algorithm and I you know I

50
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:11,640
maximization algorithm and I you know I provided the specifics for the case of

51
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,580
provided the specifics for the case of hmm but really fist the same home where

52
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,149
hmm but really fist the same home where in in many other areas of machine

53
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,279
in in many other areas of machine learning so next repeat with the Albert

54
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:26,249
learning so next repeat with the Albert looks like extra mass transfer next one

55
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:29,100
looks like extra mass transfer next one let's say to X capital T Z are they

56
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,899
let's say to X capital T Z are they affiliated latent variables we don't

57
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,610
affiliated latent variables we don't know what they are people of the

58
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,680
know what they are people of the parameters all right so whether it is

59
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,700
parameters all right so whether it is weak form this is the joint likelihood

60
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,040
weak form this is the joint likelihood usually the recipient of observations

61
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,200
usually the recipient of observations right so obviously Z is not observed but

62
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:54,959
right so obviously Z is not observed but this is the this distribution is written

63
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:14,070
this is the this distribution is written as a function and the posted information

64
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,529
as a function and the posted information variable Z it's also function of

65
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:26,119
variable Z it's also function of parameter so what we do is to create an

66
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:26,129


67
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:31,920
update this on the previous values this is the expectation of the joint of life

68
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,930
is the expectation of the joint of life it will be respect to this posterior and

69
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,689
it will be respect to this posterior and the expectation step is basically to

70
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,260
the expectation step is basically to compute this whole term Q all right do

71
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,029
compute this whole term Q all right do the calculations and then the

72
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,890
the calculations and then the maximization is once we compute it

73
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,379
maximization is once we compute it optimize it with respect to theta and

74
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:48,959
optimize it with respect to theta and once we do that then you come back to

75
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,700
once we do that then you come back to the first step to complete this with

76
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,459
the first step to complete this with theta being taking now that all the

77
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:56,040
theta being taking now that all the fifth power all and again updating theta

78
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:03,089
fifth power all and again updating theta etcetera etcetera okay hmm in other

79
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,070
etcetera etcetera okay hmm in other place you will get different sufficient

80
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,200
place you will get different sufficient statistics the sufficient statistics

81
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,790
statistics the sufficient statistics that they were coming up where

82
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,430
that they were coming up where effectively this is moving distribution

83
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,010
effectively this is moving distribution gamma this is gamma of G T which is the

84
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,499
gamma this is gamma of G T which is the probability of Z little T given all the

85
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,450
probability of Z little T given all the data and again compute at the old

86
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,450
data and again compute at the old parameters so this is a smoking

87
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,540
parameters so this is a smoking distribution because we are estimating Z

88
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,209
distribution because we are estimating Z at some time T given day the way past

89
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,689
at some time T given day the way past three by this our data from time 0 to

90
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:36,360
three by this our data from time 0 to time capital T and then we also needed

91
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,990
time capital T and then we also needed the joint smoking distribution of Z t

92
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,370
the joint smoking distribution of Z t minus 1 DT okay and I'm going to remind

93
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,519
minus 1 DT okay and I'm going to remind you today and we have seen these

94
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,430
you today and we have seen these calculations from 12 is are coming so

95
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,260
calculations from 12 is are coming so this is the Joint Distribution of CT

96
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,460
this is the Joint Distribution of CT minus 1 and city now ZT is let's say we

97
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,800
minus 1 and city now ZT is let's say we have K States all right so this is a

98
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,590
have K States all right so this is a vector at this time of vector of

99
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,079
vector at this time of vector of dimension K and this symmetric state by

100
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:09,300
dimension K and this symmetric state by K okay in this recipe in this problem

101
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,639
K okay in this recipe in this problem this time the sufficient statistics that

102
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,300
this time the sufficient statistics that you need to compute the joint of

103
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,550
you need to compute the joint of likelihood in essence all the

104
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,110
likelihood in essence all the information you need to extract from the

105
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:25,530
information you need to extract from the data is list and that ok now this you

106
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,540
data is list and that ok now this you know I already have you know discussed

107
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,220
know I already have you know discussed this before we're going to basically

108
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,740
this before we're going to basically need to do that for words mark wants

109
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,620
need to do that for words mark wants messed is fasting okay because basically

110
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,329
messed is fasting okay because basically this gamma is the product of alpha and

111
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:38,579
this gamma is the product of alpha and beta messages but you know you can do a

112
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,530
beta messages but you know you can do a llama decryption and we already have

113
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,780
llama decryption and we already have seen that as well and

114
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,150
seen that as well and first I'll show you know will become if

115
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,890
first I'll show you know will become if you do it for good the backward passing

116
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,780
you do it for good the backward passing you can calculate this on the fly as

117
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,890
you can calculate this on the fly as well alright so we don't need this let

118
00:09:52,890 --> 00:10:00,180
well alright so we don't need this let me just go to review very fast I two

119
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,830
me just go to review very fast I two days ago so when I sum we have to

120
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,550
days ago so when I sum we have to calculate one of Z T right zippy can

121
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,060
calculate one of Z T right zippy can take K values so we actually take them

122
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,640
take K values so we actually take them escape analysis to calculate one of ZT k

123
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,050
escape analysis to calculate one of ZT k so can you tell me this is mystically so

124
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,560
so can you tell me this is mystically so when I shall teach and a time indicator

125
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,110
when I shall teach and a time indicator care is a straight indicator so what is

126
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,140
care is a straight indicator so what is very much city K so we know that we're

127
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,910
very much city K so we know that we're talking about the same things the

128
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:41,830
talking about the same things the probability is that

129
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:41,840


130
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,540
so the system probability right Caesar is a fastidious moving distribution

131
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,670
is a fastidious moving distribution doesn't credit accounts so it what is

132
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,519
doesn't credit accounts so it what is gamma opposite decay and I remind you

133
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,050
gamma opposite decay and I remind you again I kept no one to keep going back

134
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,240
again I kept no one to keep going back to takes ten minutes to do so this is

135
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,550
to takes ten minutes to do so this is the definition of the veteran CT gamma Z

136
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,070
the definition of the veteran CT gamma Z T it's the post a diversity given all

137
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,380
T it's the post a diversity given all the data from time one to time capital T

138
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:09,310
the data from time one to time capital T so what this gram of ZT k when I put the

139
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,260
so what this gram of ZT k when I put the index there explicitly so this is a

140
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,860
index there explicitly so this is a number is not a vector right so what is

141
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:39,320
number is not a vector right so what is gamma of Z DK is the probability of

142
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,330


143
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:45,510
we sent it so basically this agency decay Spanish missions to them and this

144
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,130
decay Spanish missions to them and this is the posterior probability that they

145
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,860
is the posterior probability that they will take the value up okay and if the

146
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,710
will take the value up okay and if the values are 1 and 0 obviously this is the

147
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,800
values are 1 and 0 obviously this is the same is the expectation of ztk right

148
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,900
same is the expectation of ztk right because the expectation is the value at

149
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,360
because the expectation is the value at x1 times the probability times the other

150
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,760
x1 times the probability times the other value 0 times the probability so it's

151
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,230
value 0 times the probability so it's really equal to the probability that

152
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,450
really equal to the probability that typically is equal to 1 what's the

153
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,840
typically is equal to 1 what's the posterior probability and certainly you

154
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,870
posterior probability and certainly you can think this as this joint expectation

155
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:24,690
can think this as this joint expectation in a very similar fashion from time that

156
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,770
in a very similar fashion from time that they wanted capital T all right so this

157
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,990
they wanted capital T all right so this is my capital X and we're going to

158
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,980
is my capital X and we're going to calculate this Q and when you remember

159
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,070
calculate this Q and when you remember Danny is the expectation of the joint of

160
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,700
Danny is the expectation of the joint of likelihood this is y so actually just

161
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,950
likelihood this is y so actually just remind me again how did this gamma come

162
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,890
remind me again how did this gamma come here at how the tea came the other let's

163
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,770
here at how the tea came the other let's look at this theory when did this second

164
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:56,139
look at this theory when did this second from this term there

165
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:56,149


166
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:00,980
kazumi office in temperature probably discussed writing in the likely return

167
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,780
discussed writing in the likely return this was let's say this was the

168
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,370
this was let's say this was the probability of transitioning from J to K

169
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,030
probability of transitioning from J to K which is from J to K so this would be a

170
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:15,290
which is from J to K so this would be a JK - what ^ indicator function that this

171
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,980
JK - what ^ indicator function that this term here is the K term of that is equal

172
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,519
term here is the K term of that is equal to 1 and that the I'm sorry that the

173
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,879
to 1 and that the I'm sorry that the j-turn or that's equal to 1 and that the

174
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:30,590
j-turn or that's equal to 1 and that the later about is equal to 1 right and the

175
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,780
later about is equal to 1 right and the function when you take the expectations

176
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,790
function when you take the expectations with respect to the posterior what do

177
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,870
with respect to the posterior what do you get you get that all right

178
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,680
you get you get that all right and similarly from this you get this and

179
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,139
and similarly from this you get this and here I'm assuming that the observation

180
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,920
here I'm assuming that the observation model there is one observation model for

181
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,309
model there is one observation model for each state K so for the state K

182
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:55,550
each state K so for the state K basically observation what it would be P

183
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,340
basically observation what it would be P of XT given 3 K 4 PK of the parameters

184
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,639
of XT given 3 K 4 PK of the parameters involved in this expectation model so to

185
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,879
involved in this expectation model so to be able to do the expectation step on

186
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,530
be able to do the expectation step on the EM algorithm you have to compute

187
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,759
the EM algorithm you have to compute this gamma you have to compute XT and

188
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,340
this gamma you have to compute XT and and of course you know these two terms

189
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,370
and of course you know these two terms here required and in this term requires

190
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,650
here required and in this term requires 4 with but with message passing at the

191
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:24,019
4 with but with message passing at the same thing with itself there is step is

192
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:25,970
same thing with itself there is step is to basically take derivatives of these

193
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,650
to basically take derivatives of these things with respect to PK and their

194
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,720
things with respect to PK and their units with respect to H say K so it's

195
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,980
units with respect to H say K so it's simple calculus okay the only thing is

196
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,449
simple calculus okay the only thing is when you take the unit's with respect to

197
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:36,620
when you take the unit's with respect to B K you have to put in advance

198
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,019
B K you have to put in advance multiplier because the time for the P

199
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:39,590
multiplier because the time for the P K's

200
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:43,249
K's over the capital K States is equal to 1

201
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,129
over the capital K States is equal to 1 very very differentiated take the units

202
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:49,009
very very differentiated take the units equal to 0 you get basically

203
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:52,699
equal to 0 you get basically PK to be equal dot and a JK equal to 1

204
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,490
PK to be equal dot and a JK equal to 1 okay and then the British action is

205
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,319
okay and then the British action is exactly what you will expect as an

206
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:00,840
exactly what you will expect as an answer right range a K the

207
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,120
answer right range a K the the Emily estimate is the number of

208
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,330
the Emily estimate is the number of times that you transition from state say

209
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,550
times that you transition from state say to carry over have different time

210
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,390
to carry over have different time instants ISTE right and divide it by the

211
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,600
instants ISTE right and divide it by the time square developed state J and the

212
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,330
time square developed state J and the transition to anything given by the

213
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:24,420
transition to anything given by the label level L equal 1 to capital K make

214
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,640
label level L equal 1 to capital K make some sense okay

215
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:29,650


216
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:38,290
no calculation for the observation model if the answers you gave of course depend

217
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,140
if the answers you gave of course depend on what observation model you have so

218
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,270
on what observation model you have so let's say if the observation volunteers

219
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,730
let's say if the observation volunteers that contain small as a Gaussian and the

220
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,860
that contain small as a Gaussian and the unknowns for each state k is me to the

221
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,120
unknowns for each state k is me to the mean and the covariance basically then

222
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,550
mean and the covariance basically then taking derivatives of the last time I

223
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,820
taking derivatives of the last time I mean Q basically leaving this is the

224
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,540
mean Q basically leaving this is the only place where this coefficients come

225
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,100
only place where this coefficients come so really you won't get any effect from

226
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,260
so really you won't get any effect from there so if you take the log of the

227
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,750
there so if you take the log of the Gaussian and you differentiate you

228
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,260
Gaussian and you differentiate you effectively get forties did you get the

229
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,220
effectively get forties did you get the UK is the weighted average of all the

230
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,430
UK is the weighted average of all the observations X 3 but this rate is with

231
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,420
observations X 3 but this rate is with respect to this procedure

232
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,850
respect to this procedure responsibilities comma right actually

233
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,740
responsibilities comma right actually that is the reason we call gamma to be

234
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,750
that is the reason we call gamma to be the posterior responsibilities and

235
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,350
the posterior responsibilities and similarly you get 4 Sigma K the same

236
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,360
similarly you get 4 Sigma K the same thing this is like the sample covariance

237
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,150
thing this is like the sample covariance but now it's you notice is weighted by

238
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,780
but now it's you notice is weighted by the posterior possibilities this is

239
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,910
the posterior possibilities this is identical effectively with estimating

240
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,290
identical effectively with estimating the coefficients in a Gaussian mixture

241
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,670
the coefficients in a Gaussian mixture all right because as we know the you

242
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,400
all right because as we know the you know the hmm model but this in the

243
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,020
know the hmm model but this in the context of wearing the parameters is not

244
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,830
context of wearing the parameters is not very much different from the estimated

245
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,130
very much different from the estimated parameters in the Gaussian mixture maybe

246
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,510
parameters in the Gaussian mixture maybe should be wants to give you some

247
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,120
should be wants to give you some homework some calculating those things

248
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,970
homework some calculating those things ok they each of them is like 5 lines but

249
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,130
ok they each of them is like 5 lines but in Ephesus to will force you to do the

250
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,280
in Ephesus to will force you to do the algebra and figure out for example here

251
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,350
algebra and figure out for example here that Bernoulli observation model or a

252
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,150
that Bernoulli observation model or a multi unit you know to do this

253
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,310
multi unit you know to do this calculations correct and not sure to

254
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,689
calculations correct and not sure to understand what this meaning side

255
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:20,079
understand what this meaning side because if you have a little bit small

256
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,500
because if you have a little bit small beware maybe a very small bill all right

257
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,790
beware maybe a very small bill all right so you know you ever have to give us a

258
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,710
so you know you ever have to give us a multi annuity distribution so this

259
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,910
multi annuity distribution so this calculation stuff basically

260
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,240
calculation stuff basically straightforward with just a few lines of

261
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,590
straightforward with just a few lines of calculations okay

262
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,120
calculations okay I remember I'm left with this but let me

263
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,220
I remember I'm left with this but let me just say the the following which

264
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,770
just say the the following which sometimes when you try to to learn the

265
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,919
sometimes when you try to to learn the parameters with one dataset from the

266
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:45,500
parameters with one dataset from the take time you want the time capital T so

267
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,590
take time you want the time capital T so you live data basically on one pass over

268
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,990
you live data basically on one pass over the train maybe the data is not an

269
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,490
the train maybe the data is not an obstacle to making the parameters

270
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,470
obstacle to making the parameters because if you think that you have an

271
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,220
because if you think that you have an XML mangled up is from a satellite so

272
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,770
XML mangled up is from a satellite so you can go backwards so once we move

273
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,860
you can go backwards so once we move speak to you never go back to say - so

274
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,480
speak to you never go back to say - so you won't have enough information to say

275
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,720
you won't have enough information to say to cut made the transition from due to

276
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,000
to cut made the transition from due to slightly you only have one equation

277
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,120
slightly you only have one equation information to help you to do that so in

278
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,730
information to help you to do that so in that case what it helps is to repeat

279
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:22,070
that case what it helps is to repeat this not for one data set all right each

280
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,220
this not for one data set all right each of them being a sequence of data from

281
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,760
of them being a sequence of data from time wanna take the time Ti so basically

282
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,950
time wanna take the time Ti so basically we would have done in this slide and I'm

283
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,850
we would have done in this slide and I'm not going to go through all of the

284
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:36,039
not going to go through all of the calculations are exactly the same

285
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,289
calculations are exactly the same results that I had before the only thing

286
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,210
results that I had before the only thing that I have changed this in the

287
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:49,090
that I have changed this in the sufficient statistics by the summation

288
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:49,100


289
00:18:49,100 --> 00:19:01,880
of course you know the duration of the train if you like that each of them we

290
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,399
train if you like that each of them we have a different duration from let's say

291
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:07,640
have a different duration from let's say time 1 2 TI right to be the same but can

292
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,680
time 1 2 TI right to be the same but can be different but so the only thing I

293
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,200
be different but so the only thing I have is different from before varies

294
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,440
have is different from before varies estimation capital n capital n is how

295
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,370
estimation capital n capital n is how many knots you know how many capital

296
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,380
many knots you know how many capital extra stuff I had before I have provided

297
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,380
extra stuff I had before I have provided you because capital X was data from time

298
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,930
you because capital X was data from time wanted to T now I give you n approach

299
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,060
wanted to T now I give you n approach okay so about the only thing that

300
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,629
okay so about the only thing that changes the rest remains basically

301
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:43,879
changes the rest remains basically in veins the tape let me go fastest if

302
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:53,210
in veins the tape let me go fastest if there is anything interesting

303
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:53,220


304
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,030
and then we would get out of this in case you have not seen it for example

305
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:03,300
case you have not seen it for example when I knew this is the yep alright what

306
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,310
when I knew this is the yep alright what you can do is you can enhance your

307
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,350
you can do is you can enhance your business best friend anomaly estimate

308
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,440
business best friend anomaly estimate right so you can put something in the

309
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,810
right so you can put something in the parameters and immediately transform of

310
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,420
parameters and immediately transform of this to an office and that's the trivial

311
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,780
this to an office and that's the trivial calculation so if you look at maybe

312
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,760
calculation so if you look at maybe books or even people give this as a call

313
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,450
books or even people give this as a call mark maybe

314
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,040
mark maybe Subic wants to give you this as a

315
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,470
Subic wants to give you this as a homework you can put some prior on 5k

316
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:29,640
homework you can put some prior on 5k some fire on a JK and base you can

317
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,520
some fire on a JK and base you can before if you remember what we did is we

318
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,460
before if you remember what we did is we started me crazy the likelihood model

319
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,370
started me crazy the likelihood model like that so now that you will base you

320
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,890
like that so now that you will base you have the likelihood modern times the

321
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,960
have the likelihood modern times the probability law the parameters and then

322
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,180
probability law the parameters and then be exactly the same calculation you will

323
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,700
be exactly the same calculation you will just give contribution from the much of

324
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,250
just give contribution from the much of the priors but eventually when you do

325
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,740
the priors but eventually when you do that I am aware that you will give you

326
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,930
that I am aware that you will give you my estimates for the parameters and that

327
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,560
my estimates for the parameters and that standard okay

328
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,560
standard okay to get you know good results especially

329
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,970
to get you know good results especially when we have limited data okay

330
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,130
when we have limited data okay there is there are other ways actually

331
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,830
there is there are other ways actually that you know instead of getting the map

332
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,620
that you know instead of getting the map estimate somebody may be interested to

333
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,740
estimate somebody may be interested to get samples of actions II instead and I

334
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,210
get samples of actions II instead and I think if I have time I'm going to come

335
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,430
think if I have time I'm going to come back to that because has implications in

336
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,300
back to that because has implications in the lots of applications in robotics and

337
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,980
the lots of applications in robotics and animation things that use particle

338
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:33,139
animation things that use particle filter specially to operate with okay

339
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:33,149


340
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:41,060
right so today I have been given a circus clown Olympic review or the

341
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,959
circus clown Olympic review or the message passing without using actually

342
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:59,539
message passing without using actually the propagation it is science physical

343
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:01,369
the propagation it is science physical science is you know prediction of

344
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:04,159
science is you know prediction of whether climate whatever this is have

345
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,669
whether climate whatever this is have problems that you need on each of them

346
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:39,769
problems that you need on each of them so I need to interstate so this is

347
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:41,450
so I need to interstate so this is what's called the filtering distribution

348
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,549
what's called the filtering distribution so the anticipate that the filtering

349
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:45,979
so the anticipate that the filtering distribution would be noisy you won't be

350
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:50,060
distribution would be noisy you won't be able estimated precisely because somehow

351
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,769
able estimated precisely because somehow you just got some measurements on the

352
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,479
you just got some measurements on the case ago you know you're not going to

353
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:55,639
case ago you know you're not going to give the best estimates for this G of T

354
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,889
give the best estimates for this G of T so expect this filtering distribution to

355
00:22:57,889 --> 00:23:01,070
so expect this filtering distribution to be noise the smoothing distribution

356
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,979
be noise the smoothing distribution which we actually gives it to define

357
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:08,019
which we actually gives it to define this gamma messages okay is the

358
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,450
this gamma messages okay is the condition to compute the little T given

359
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,729
condition to compute the little T given all the data back to capital T this is

360
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:15,109
all the data back to capital T this is the smoothing distribution so

361
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:19,099
the smoothing distribution so effectively you use future data to do

362
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:24,320
effectively you use future data to do estimation at earlier times so you know

363
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,599
estimation at earlier times so you know this is an effective organization if you

364
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:30,079
this is an effective organization if you like on the on on this destination so

365
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,879
like on the on on this destination so you expect this distribution to be where

366
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:35,149
you expect this distribution to be where is mother than this distribution now

367
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:40,110
is mother than this distribution now this

368
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:40,120


369
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,370
and have the luxury to do and give estimation as anytime you want to first

370
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:48,600
estimation as anytime you want to first you say yes to me now so that's the best

371
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,190
you say yes to me now so that's the best you can do okay so this is very much

372
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,020
you can do okay so this is very much related sort of if you are going to do

373
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,240
related sort of if you are going to do an inverse problem maybe this is more

374
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,180
an inverse problem maybe this is more related but if you do online estimation

375
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,390
related but if you do online estimation you want to know where to navigate about

376
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,600
you want to know where to navigate about let you know you need to know the faith

377
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,850
let you know you need to know the faith Testament all the time so this is the

378
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,710
Testament all the time so this is the distribution interplay with obviously

379
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,200
distribution interplay with obviously you know you can do some smoothing not

380
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,480
you know you can do some smoothing not that the state feedback of say P minus L

381
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,730
that the state feedback of say P minus L so this is the fixed large more thing if

382
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,210
so this is the fixed large more thing if you pixel so maybe at this time you can

383
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,540
you pixel so maybe at this time you can have the nutrient the previous estimates

384
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,610
have the nutrient the previous estimates all right this is this fixed large house

385
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,630
all right this is this fixed large house nothing you can do predictions of what

386
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,180
nothing you can do predictions of what the state is going to be next

387
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,440
the state is going to be next all right so this is and here the simple

388
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,300
all right so this is and here the simple calculation on how using the time of the

389
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,330
calculation on how using the time of the time P to actually go further than

390
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,120
time P to actually go further than calculate the speed T steps ahead and

391
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,990
calculate the speed T steps ahead and now this is actually the only thing that

392
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,340
now this is actually the only thing that you need to know to do this calculation

393
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,640
you need to know to do this calculation is to know this filtering distribution

394
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,190
is to know this filtering distribution which we will compute okay that's the

395
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,430
which we will compute okay that's the filtering distribution and using basic

396
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,650
filtering distribution and using basic laws of probability the two additional

397
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,850
laws of probability the two additional things that are coming is the

398
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,580
things that are coming is the transitions from T to T plus 1 and Tim

399
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,310
transitions from T to T plus 1 and Tim plus 1 to T plus 2 you can actually set

400
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,120
plus 1 to T plus 2 you can actually set the algebra

401
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,710
the algebra ok the risk you know there is really

402
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,660
ok the risk you know there is really nothing here so it's basically this

403
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,610
nothing here so it's basically this calculation for dimensionalize with

404
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:24,590
calculation for dimensionalize with respect to DT and DT plus 1 so you can

405
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,080
respect to DT and DT plus 1 so you can Nestle the future right but you do not

406
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,900
Nestle the future right but you do not need to now again with the filtering

407
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,570
need to now again with the filtering distribution at time T

408
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:35,580


409
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:42,049
right and something that actually you don't see what's in books but it is

410
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:45,360
don't see what's in books but it is essential as you collect date and time

411
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,419
essential as you collect date and time you may want to ask yourself okay a

412
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:51,390
you may want to ask yourself okay a collected date of the time T what is the

413
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,000
collected date of the time T what is the probability of observing some need a

414
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,520
probability of observing some need a part time T plus eight all right so you

415
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,780
part time T plus eight all right so you can figure this rental car as a right

416
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,820
can figure this rental car as a right but based on the knowledge that you have

417
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,669
but based on the knowledge that you have up to time T it tells you the

418
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:13,049
up to time T it tells you the probability of observing beta X at time

419
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:15,390
probability of observing beta X at time T plus h so this is what is called a

420
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,010
T plus h so this is what is called a posterior predictive dance that they are

421
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,900
posterior predictive dance that they are right and the difference basically from

422
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,909
right and the difference basically from what we did here is here we are

423
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:23,430
what we did here is here we are predicting the state attacked here were

424
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:27,390
predicting the state attacked here were predicting the observations have these

425
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,190
predicting the observations have these distributions you see here of this

426
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,220
distributions you see here of this picture there is very fundamental I mean

427
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,530
picture there is very fundamental I mean if that's why I'm trying to do this as

428
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,930
if that's why I'm trying to do this as elementary as possible because if you

429
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,400
elementary as possible because if you work on anything that has to do with

430
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,690
work on anything that has to do with mental and dynamics which is it it

431
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,370
mental and dynamics which is it it doesn't matter what the technique is if

432
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,159
doesn't matter what the technique is if it's an hmm if it is a mechanic's

433
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,740
it's an hmm if it is a mechanic's probabilities of the universe of the

434
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,720
probabilities of the universe of the whole or something whatever was in

435
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,960
whole or something whatever was in unused today this is it okay

436
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,950
unused today this is it okay so you need to know this idea now that's

437
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,049
so you need to know this idea now that's not the problems and the elevation

438
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:07,140
not the problems and the elevation problems that they're a little more

439
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,940
problems that they're a little more complicated to do work where some we

440
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,030
complicated to do work where some we have discussed right when I give you say

441
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:18,480
have discussed right when I give you say well an introduction to the Viterbi

442
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,159
well an introduction to the Viterbi algorithm what does the Viterbi

443
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:29,160
algorithm what does the Viterbi algorithm

444
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,170


445
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:45,610
what was that we tell the algorithm

446
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:45,620


447
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:54,060
you know we spent half an hour on it and you guys forgot about

448
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,070


449
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:58,380
and I'm sure somebody listens the vision sees some believable systems don't

450
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,080
sees some believable systems don't remember what was the Viterbi algorithm

451
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:14,070
remember what was the Viterbi algorithm what is not so what was a bit hurt you

452
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,080


453
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,310
so it was the most effective part right

454
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:19,320


455
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:25,530
given some of the resistance exhaust it is that what he said the most likely saw

456
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,500
is that what he said the most likely saw this many this is the path from Z of Z

457
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,150
this many this is the path from Z of Z from 1 to capital T given the

458
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:35,480
from 1 to capital T given the observation of x1 city ok so the basic

459
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,740
observation of x1 city ok so the basic infinite especially if the states of

460
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,050
infinite especially if the states of every time is the bigger number alright

461
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:44,550
every time is the bigger number alright so this says we're maximizing basically

462
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,680
so this says we're maximizing basically the posterior but in the be turbulent if

463
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,380
the posterior but in the be turbulent if we were really interested define this is

464
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,540
we were really interested define this is not what the maximum joint distribution

465
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,000
not what the maximum joint distribution all those this was but to find what our

466
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,610
all those this was but to find what our resist what is the path that maximizes

467
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,710
resist what is the path that maximizes this force field distribution now you

468
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:06,060
this force field distribution now you know again it's the true thick to give

469
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,570
know again it's the true thick to give you a homework on this to drive you not

470
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:11,190
you a homework on this to drive you not so you can learn something but the idea

471
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,910
so you can learn something but the idea here is this is not a very robust

472
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:17,160
here is this is not a very robust calculation and sometimes if you want

473
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,730
calculation and sometimes if you want this you may be happy if you actually go

474
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:25,610
this you may be happy if you actually go from the posterior or something taking

475
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,990
from the posterior or something taking you may want to estimate strong force

476
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,300
you may want to estimate strong force all right so it's a very substantial

477
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:35,360
all right so it's a very substantial problem and we covered this idea with

478
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,770
problem and we covered this idea with using sequence some of the cargo methods

479
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:42,510
using sequence some of the cargo methods in the course in in the fall so if

480
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,160
in the course in in the fall so if anybody wants to read more details on

481
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,570
anybody wants to read more details on this type of problems using sequential

482
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,230
this type of problems using sequential Montecarlo used to look up then this is

483
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,900
Montecarlo used to look up then this is not I emphasize this is not particular

484
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,290
not I emphasize this is not particular to this fast if you do any problem where

485
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:59,310
to this fast if you do any problem where you have data coming in right these are

486
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,680
you have data coming in right these are fundamental problems there is no way you

487
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,760
fundamental problems there is no way you can escape from this ok it's in our any

488
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,380
can escape from this ok it's in our any character in computer science and

489
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,170
character in computer science and physics in chemistry in engineering this

490
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,290
physics in chemistry in engineering this is a very sensitive problem to be able

491
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:17,200
is a very sensitive problem to be able sample from the posterior ok this

492
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:54,370
sample from the posterior ok this all right you need to play from the

493
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:57,010
all right you need to play from the evidence to maximize the evidence with

494
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,260
evidence to maximize the evidence with respect to the parameters this is how at

495
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,139
respect to the parameters this is how at the end of the day even the EMR which

496
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:05,350
the end of the day even the EMR which works but this calculation is not what

497
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,049
works but this calculation is not what you need to do and we would still what

498
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:10,090
you need to do and we would still what if you do message passing actually you

499
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,830
if you do message passing actually you can calculate this always with linear

500
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,470
can calculate this always with linear cost on the length of the chain in a

501
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,240
cost on the length of the chain in a very trivial fashion using forward and

502
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,409
very trivial fashion using forward and backward messaging all right so this is

503
00:31:20,409 --> 00:31:23,340
backward messaging all right so this is a picture showing the different problems

504
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,710
a picture showing the different problems alright are you sure we did and this is

505
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,990
alright are you sure we did and this is an example again it's in the notes to

506
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:32,260
an example again it's in the notes to tell you how the different resolution

507
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:36,850
tell you how the different resolution I'm not gonna go through that so let me

508
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:48,159
I'm not gonna go through that so let me keep going and going all right right I

509
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,299
keep going and going all right right I have the message parsing algorithms that

510
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:54,310
have the message parsing algorithms that you need in the context of the e/m

511
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,779
you need in the context of the e/m algorithm to have better relations

512
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:03,370
algorithm to have better relations without using after the propagation none

513
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,870
without using after the propagation none of the above because we have done all of

514
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,210
of the above because we have done all of this i'd always using the simple rules

515
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:13,800
this i'd always using the simple rules of probability and i want to

516
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:13,810


517
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:21,760
there's nothing new the compressions are so you mentally you don't need to

518
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,410
so you mentally you don't need to complicate them for this problem to get

519
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,270
complicate them for this problem to get this results you can get them with a lot

520
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,580
this results you can get them with a lot of ability and you may ask me then why

521
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,680
of ability and you may ask me then why did belief propagation and all of these

522
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,140
did belief propagation and all of these things on junction 3 well because not

523
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,700
things on junction 3 well because not everything is it didn't lock up more

524
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,010
everything is it didn't lock up more than in life well the pumps are much

525
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,530
than in life well the pumps are much more complicated right you know can be

526
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:44,530
more complicated right you know can be anything and you know that is not a tree

527
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,020
anything and you know that is not a tree you won't be able to use this recursive

528
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,210
you won't be able to use this recursive techniques you have to use belief

529
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,890
techniques you have to use belief propagation Junction tree however it's

530
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:55,710
propagation Junction tree however it's as we discussed okay but the end that

531
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,120
as we discussed okay but the end that like the state space water we covered

532
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,570
like the state space water we covered next week I'll sort of the essential

533
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:09,430
next week I'll sort of the essential element of them and I want to be sure

534
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:16,030
element of them and I want to be sure that can work to actually notice it okay

535
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:20,650
that can work to actually notice it okay so lots of calculations basically to

536
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,420
so lots of calculations basically to convey to themselves that they

537
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:27,730
convey to themselves that they understand what's going on using

538
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:31,960
understand what's going on using absolutely nothing else but dissipation

539
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,850
absolutely nothing else but dissipation and independence for the hidden Markov

540
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:38,200
and independence for the hidden Markov model okay so what you want is I want to

541
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,660
model okay so what you want is I want to complete with anime means this the

542
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,970
complete with anime means this the problem intensity given the data time T

543
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,400
problem intensity given the data time T and we call this the filtering

544
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,960
and we call this the filtering distribution okay so in two steps

545
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,620
distribution okay so in two steps okay so we're going to assume that this

546
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,630
okay so we're going to assume that this is going to be recursive calculation is

547
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,640
is going to be recursive calculation is going to be a forward calculation which

548
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,340
going to be a forward calculation which means I am going to assume that somehow

549
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,310
means I am going to assume that somehow I know this content distribution of time

550
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,580
I know this content distribution of time t minus one okay so this distribution

551
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,750
t minus one okay so this distribution that we see here

552
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:12,760


553
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,880
anyway so the plan is to compute on and we're leaving two steps so the first

554
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,480
we're leaving two steps so the first step is I am going to calculate the

555
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,580
step is I am going to calculate the predictive distribution of Z P which is

556
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,280
predictive distribution of Z P which is one step ahead give it back up to ten

557
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,190
one step ahead give it back up to ten minus one

558
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:34,330
minus one I mean this is you can enter this

559
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,550
I mean this is you can enter this equation and you're not gonna tell me

560
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,620
equation and you're not gonna tell me you don't understand from 40k right so I

561
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,310
you don't understand from 40k right so I need to calculate this city equal to j

562
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:45,400
need to calculate this city equal to j given extra 1 to t minus 1 and I have

563
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,940
given extra 1 to t minus 1 and I have that I do this as the probability of

564
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,790
that I do this as the probability of city - one being I given the date up to

565
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,520
city - one being I given the date up to t minus 1 and then the probability of CP

566
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,270
t minus 1 and then the probability of CP given 60 minus 1 the shipping for a

567
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:05,590
given 60 minus 1 the shipping for a Baptist ridiculous I introduced ZT minus

568
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:08,560
Baptist ridiculous I introduced ZT minus 1 inside there so I perform a city minus

569
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:34,970
1 inside there so I perform a city minus 1 and minus J okay okay

570
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:41,569
1 and minus J okay okay you need some country no okay all right

571
00:35:41,569 --> 00:35:44,750
you need some country no okay all right so that's one okay so we we assume we

572
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,339
so that's one okay so we we assume we know things up to two minus one we know

573
00:35:46,339 --> 00:35:49,010
know things up to two minus one we know this so we can go one step ahead in time

574
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:52,730
this so we can go one step ahead in time T and find city I'm going to compute

575
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:57,560
T and find city I'm going to compute risk and I'm exploring the different

576
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,300
risk and I'm exploring the different notations in the literature basically

577
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,460
notations in the literature basically don't get confused they all give you the

578
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,319
don't get confused they all give you the same answers at the end of the day so we

579
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:08,210
same answers at the end of the day so we want to compute this and this is this is

580
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:12,440
want to compute this and this is this is what we have used it exactly like this

581
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,410
what we have used it exactly like this in with some difference based on this

582
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,810
in with some difference based on this normalization factor the probability of

583
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:24,050
normalization factor the probability of the data okay this distribution to be my

584
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:39,950
the data okay this distribution to be my optimistic I'll give it a name J okay so

585
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:45,620
optimistic I'll give it a name J okay so I 1/2 T is X 1 to t minus 1 and XT all

586
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,690
I 1/2 T is X 1 to t minus 1 and XT all right and I say this looks ball should

587
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:50,540
right and I say this looks ball should not be bored okay all right unless X of

588
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,940
not be bored okay all right unless X of course is a multi-variant volleyball

589
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,050
course is a multi-variant volleyball there okay

590
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,270
there okay so what you write down from here to

591
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:01,809
so what you write down from here to there so basically when I have done by

592
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:04,490
there so basically when I have done by using a factory sent obey this rule if

593
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:07,880
using a factory sent obey this rule if you like or the probabilities I remember

594
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,640
you like or the probabilities I remember sixth eighth to the left and I move a

595
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:34,940
sixth eighth to the left and I move a normalization

596
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:34,950


597
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:41,690
communities but conditions still investing with you know toxic this is is

598
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,970
investing with you know toxic this is is you know because what distribution is

599
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,720
you know because what distribution is this is the distribution we computed and

600
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,700
this is the distribution we computed and what distribution is risk

601
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,030
what distribution is risk you never does XP the based on the

602
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,950
you never does XP the based on the previous measurements if I know the

603
00:37:54,950 --> 00:38:00,349
previous measurements if I know the strength of time T dissipation is you

604
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:04,760
strength of time T dissipation is you know the state the kind of patient I'm

605
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:14,289
know the state the kind of patient I'm tips okay so the other message which is

606
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:24,079
tips okay so the other message which is this is written as observation value

607
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:31,370
this is written as observation value which we know okay and the normalization

608
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:34,280
which we know okay and the normalization factor that we live here is that there

609
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,589
factor that we live here is that there are media effects they given X 1 2 3

610
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:38,720
are media effects they given X 1 2 3 minus 1 and this way the normalization

611
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,289
minus 1 and this way the normalization factor is if you take all of this

612
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:44,030
factor is if you take all of this alright and you sign for the possible

613
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,069
alright and you sign for the possible values of Z so basically if you take

614
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:47,809
values of Z so basically if you take this distribution there and you

615
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:50,569
this distribution there and you normalize it with respect to Z you get

616
00:38:50,569 --> 00:38:55,400
normalize it with respect to Z you get the GT and it looks shelter for useless

617
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,430
the GT and it looks shelter for useless calculation this DT virtuosity would be

618
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,839
calculation this DT virtuosity would be essential because you will give us a

619
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,710
essential because you will give us a rapid calculation of the evidence but is

620
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:15,710
rapid calculation of the evidence but is used everywhere in Mesilla okay message

621
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,930
used everywhere in Mesilla okay message and this is the way that roughly defines

622
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:21,470
and this is the way that roughly defines it as the poster of city given date up

623
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:25,640
it as the poster of city given date up to 20 so sentences but can know their

624
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,309
to 20 so sentences but can know their papers and many other offers they

625
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:31,490
papers and many other offers they defined the Alpha masses not as the

626
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,589
defined the Alpha masses not as the posterior of ZT given this data but

627
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:34,980
posterior of ZT given this data but isn't joint

628
00:39:34,980 --> 00:40:18,310
isn't joint and papers inside my notes if not

629
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:33,720
and papers inside my notes if not indicate this one as the posterior okay

630
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:33,730


631
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:42,790
x1 to XP and ending on stage but this is the first video to have the state equal

632
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,950
the first video to have the state equal to J given all the observations there

633
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,990
to J given all the observations there faster the same thing okay

634
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:50,320
faster the same thing okay but again is when you do calculations to

635
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,310
but again is when you do calculations to define it very distant and and so we

636
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,960
define it very distant and and so we don't have any mistakes what I chose

637
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,910
don't have any mistakes what I chose sorry

638
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,320
sorry the line senescence defined as this

639
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,140
the line senescence defined as this filtering posterior distribution is the

640
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,180
filtering posterior distribution is the product of the observation model times

641
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,890
product of the observation model times this predictive one step ahead

642
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:10,810
this predictive one step ahead distribution where this one step ahead

643
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,550
distribution where this one step ahead the tradition was written like that and

644
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,190
the tradition was written like that and I can tell you that it's there if you

645
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,300
I can tell you that it's there if you want to provision this

646
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,470
want to provision this it's a one-line calculation so a music

647
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,079
it's a one-line calculation so a music notation from at this book to divide he

648
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:26,200
notation from at this book to divide he divides me the transition matrix notice

649
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,829
divides me the transition matrix notice a capital sigh and the observation model

650
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:33,099
a capital sigh and the observation model of the state text a XD Givens DJ is DT

651
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:36,700
of the state text a XD Givens DJ is DT equal to J as little sigh of J appointee

652
00:41:36,700 --> 00:42:15,150
equal to J as little sigh of J appointee and

653
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:15,160


654
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:48,009
okay so when I do this combination is a matrix times a vector for each of the

655
00:42:48,009 --> 00:42:52,120
matrix times a vector for each of the stage I guess I get this vector and what

656
00:42:52,120 --> 00:43:48,820
stage I guess I get this vector and what is this

657
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:48,830


658
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:59,740
okay which means you need to be done okay

659
00:43:59,740 --> 00:43:59,750


660
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:06,320
the normalization right in the derivation here is the probability given

661
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,900
derivation here is the probability given all the previous data this is nice you

662
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,670
all the previous data this is nice you know why because of this normalization

663
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,760
know why because of this normalization factor from time 1 to capital P it will

664
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,800
factor from time 1 to capital P it will give you actually the evidence from 1 to

665
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,000
give you actually the evidence from 1 to capital T so the evidence basically is

666
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,160
capital T so the evidence basically is the summation of all of the normal is

667
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,930
the summation of all of the normal is the launch of the organization factors

668
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,870
the launch of the organization factors that you will get when you normalize

669
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:36,710
that you will get when you normalize this outlet is probability okay so so

670
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,820
this outlet is probability okay so so the other one is basically you know

671
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,540
the other one is basically you know obviously you have to start the

672
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,800
obviously you have to start the algorithm units that formula

673
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,390
algorithm units that formula message-passing you have to calculate

674
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,880
message-passing you have to calculate the Alpha measures and the normalization

675
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,270
the Alpha measures and the normalization factor step one and then basically you

676
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,950
factor step one and then basically you do this multiplication this kind of our

677
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:55,040
do this multiplication this kind of our product you normalize to get the

678
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,230
product you normalize to get the normalization GT and the message alpha T

679
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:59,590
normalization GT and the message alpha T and if you want find the evidence

680
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:02,900
and if you want find the evidence basically you take the sum of all the

681
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,570
basically you take the sum of all the logs of cities and as the evidence and

682
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:09,610
logs of cities and as the evidence and results am

683
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:09,620


684
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:20,120
definition of family it doesn't make a difference because it's so personal you

685
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,920
difference because it's so personal you know going to sound to our answer if

686
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,470
know going to sound to our answer if this can normalize them and so if you

687
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:26,510
this can normalize them and so if you only think you're fine definition versus

688
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:27,230
only think you're fine definition versus the other

689
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,300
the other either the normalization factor will

690
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,580
either the normalization factor will come to be on everyone and you

691
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:35,930
come to be on everyone and you contradict okay so you don't have to

692
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,580
contradict okay so you don't have to worry about the patient's years because

693
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:43,750
worry about the patient's years because they're at the end of the day equivalent

694
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:43,760


695
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:57,740
if I can give in in explicit form it's a calculation right for sure to complete

696
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:00,860
calculation right for sure to complete the message a 12-time think you need to

697
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,980
the message a 12-time think you need to know the matter of x t minus 1 and

698
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,850
know the matter of x t minus 1 and effectively obviously you need to

699
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:08,960
effectively obviously you need to advance this with the transition

700
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,670
advance this with the transition probability plus the observation model

701
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:17,350
probability plus the observation model and so so it's a parable más despacio

702
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:22,760
and so so it's a parable más despacio now there's masses past week and even

703
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,550
now there's masses past week and even when we did the junction tree

704
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:27,200
when we did the junction tree implementation for the hmm I told you

705
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,780
implementation for the hmm I told you that they're discussing is more

706
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:34,460
that they're discussing is more important than the message passing so

707
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,810
important than the message passing so I'm gonna start with an ominous is

708
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:38,510
I'm gonna start with an ominous is fasting but I'll be trying to make the

709
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:44,450
fasting but I'll be trying to make the posterior of City given what type of

710
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:46,730
posterior of City given what type of distribution then is this is this a

711
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:50,120
distribution then is this is this a filtering distribution what is this is a

712
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,550
filtering distribution what is this is a smoothing distribution so the nominal

713
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,960
smoothing distribution so the nominal mast is now because the ability know

714
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,200
mast is now because the ability know what reduces

715
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:57,210


716
00:46:57,210 --> 00:48:56,990
I am going to what's going out there so I am going to so I have P of x1 the

717
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:59,090
I am going to so I have P of x1 the capital T given the different sphere of

718
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:04,820
capital T given the different sphere of CT and now a righty I am using the

719
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:31,060
CT and now a righty I am using the observations T plus 1 to capital

720
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:31,070


721
00:49:31,070 --> 00:50:50,890
this is independence

722
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:50,900


723
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:58,700
it doesn't matter so this is the alchemist isn't it remember messages the

724
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,820
alchemist isn't it remember messages the provision of you

725
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:05,950
provision of you occupy and um given state at time T

726
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:08,410
occupy and um given state at time T right so that's the Alpha message and

727
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:11,110
right so that's the Alpha message and what is this this is what we call known

728
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:15,250
what is this this is what we call known ago the bitter message is knowing that I

729
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:18,580
ago the bitter message is knowing that I start at twenty P equal to J let's say

730
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,140
start at twenty P equal to J let's say what's the preferred video that will

731
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,690
what's the preferred video that will observe Dave XT plus 1 to X T okay

732
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:25,120
observe Dave XT plus 1 to X T okay that's the bigger message so you can see

733
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,770
that's the bigger message so you can see that there are now a system where anyone

734
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:29,770
that there are now a system where anyone interested is the product of the I'll

735
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:49,380
interested is the product of the I'll convey the message normalized okay again

736
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:49,390


737
00:51:49,390 --> 00:52:02,010
and then use this formula to compute the realm of ZT you know an average of eight

738
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:10,930
realm of ZT you know an average of eight GT is the most easy thing to complete

739
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:13,270
GT is the most easy thing to complete because at the end of the day in the my

740
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,280
because at the end of the day in the my well at least you care about the gamma

741
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,810
well at least you care about the gamma messages we don't care about the bigger

742
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:20,250
messages we don't care about the bigger messages but you know one way or another

743
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,690
messages but you know one way or another the computation approach will be similar

744
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:25,390
the computation approach will be similar violence so when you complete this

745
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:27,460
violence so when you complete this different marketing take the profits of

746
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,560
different marketing take the profits of each thing to get this or if you come up

747
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:47,460
each thing to get this or if you come up with regulation for gamma city updates

748
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:50,830
with regulation for gamma city updates so to calculate the beta messages at t

749
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:55,630
so to calculate the beta messages at t minus one is basically the bigger

750
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:59,290
minus one is basically the bigger message supplying P times the transition

751
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:00,910
message supplying P times the transition matrix provide the G times the

752
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:03,970
matrix provide the G times the observation model at time T and you

753
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:06,670
observation model at time T and you stand for all stage J right and this

754
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:08,080
stand for all stage J right and this this is the

755
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,350
this is the the point is t minus one and the

756
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:12,610
the point is t minus one and the delicious actually

757
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:14,980
delicious actually trivial and if you want to program the

758
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:19,000
trivial and if you want to program the bigger message literally what you notice

759
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,590
bigger message literally what you notice you never have enough product between

760
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:22,840
you never have enough product between the observer and model and the message

761
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,600
the observer and model and the message beta time T and then once you've found

762
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,330
beta time T and then once you've found that vector we multiply the proposition

763
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,480
that vector we multiply the proposition letters I without new vector and you get

764
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,700
letters I without new vector and you get the message because P minus 1 and again

765
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,540
the message because P minus 1 and again you say if you define the bit of essence

766
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,020
you say if you define the bit of essence or the Alpha masters in a different way

767
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,580
or the Alpha masters in a different way this may come to make reference right

768
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,190
this may come to make reference right but the normalization factor you can

769
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:47,560
but the normalization factor you can beat afterwards that's why I put a

770
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,330
beat afterwards that's why I put a proportionality condition there so that

771
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:53,200
proportionality condition there so that this is applicable to whatever

772
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,640
this is applicable to whatever definitions used for the outcome

773
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,890
definitions used for the outcome measures okay so so he doesn't make

774
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:02,650
measures okay so so he doesn't make alright if you do this update then at

775
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:04,420
alright if you do this update then at this time when you finish going all the

776
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:07,870
this time when you finish going all the way backwards you can multiply the often

777
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:11,830
way backwards you can multiply the often bigger message that it's time T and this

778
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:15,190
bigger message that it's time T and this will give me the gamma masters this is

779
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,630
will give me the gamma masters this is the initial condition we started with a

780
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:18,370
the initial condition we started with a bit of Masters of Terror at the end

781
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:21,430
bit of Masters of Terror at the end basically equal to 1 let me see if I

782
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:30,180
basically equal to 1 let me see if I have a date for gamma

783
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:30,190


784
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:36,020
what is my gamma

785
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:36,030


786
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:43,670
you see rammasun Clerk

787
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:43,680


788
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,170
okay so it's I'm pointing to sly so I'm going to keep clicking all right but at

789
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:50,930
going to keep clicking all right but at least we got one way we got one way to

790
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:54,200
least we got one way we got one way to compute these gamma messes by

791
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,030
compute these gamma messes by multiplying the Alpha and the beta

792
00:54:56,030 --> 00:55:01,070
multiplying the Alpha and the beta messages okay and if you want to find

793
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,200
messages okay and if you want to find that away with the alpha beta resistant

794
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,220
that away with the alpha beta resistant we did this really well as well look at

795
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,870
we did this really well as well look at this equation right

796
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,700
this equation right if this purple images have normalized

797
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,280
if this purple images have normalized and and the definition that I have here

798
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,640
and and the definition that I have here are normalized and you sum for personal

799
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,220
are normalized and you sum for personal values of this to GT this posterior

800
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,770
values of this to GT this posterior probabilities will sum to 1 so actually

801
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:25,040
probabilities will sum to 1 so actually from this equation at any node P you can

802
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,760
from this equation at any node P you can calculate the evidence by standing on

803
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,260
calculate the evidence by standing on possible values of the city by

804
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,880
possible values of the city by multiplying the master day alpha and

805
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,320
multiplying the master day alpha and beta okay

806
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,550
beta okay and in actually this formula can even

807
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:39,950
and in actually this formula can even look more trivial if you select there's

808
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:43,610
look more trivial if you select there's no P to be the capital you know T you

809
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,710
no P to be the capital you know T you know why how is this a question going to

810
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:49,160
know why how is this a question going to be simplified if we apply to this is for

811
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,850
be simplified if we apply to this is for a multi to be total time taken to

812
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:56,930
a multi to be total time taken to capital T what the dissipation will be

813
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:59,360
capital T what the dissipation will be politically applied for T equal to

814
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:03,140
politically applied for T equal to capital T you remember somewhere I

815
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:08,450
capital T you remember somewhere I mentioned something here

816
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:08,460


817
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:14,090
when you initialize the migga messages like starting from them the messages of

818
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:16,670
like starting from them the messages of yourself is equal to one so effectively

819
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:19,970
yourself is equal to one so effectively it can occupy played this in an even

820
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:22,600
it can occupy played this in an even simpler way out there is no good day

821
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:28,030
simpler way out there is no good day will it look like we do the summation of

822
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:40,420
will it look like we do the summation of the MS is too long again that's it okay

823
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:40,430


824
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:44,870
sighs there must be a basic available essences potential you remember we had

825
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:51,380
essences potential you remember we had to complete this joint distribution of z

826
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,470
to complete this joint distribution of z PM z p plus 1 the procedure given

827
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:56,660
PM z p plus 1 the procedure given observation choice there's nothing joint

828
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,870
observation choice there's nothing joint distribution so we needed remembering

829
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:01,849
distribution so we needed remembering the sufficient statistics that were

830
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:05,630
the sufficient statistics that were coming X - Alki J the transition matrix

831
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,760
coming X - Alki J the transition matrix we need to find how many times will

832
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,670
we need to find how many times will state I and the transition say and that

833
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:12,740
state I and the transition say and that came out to be equal to this sufficient

834
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:24,740
came out to be equal to this sufficient statistic so the actual independence it

835
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:27,740
statistic so the actual independence it comes out that the completeness the

836
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:30,320
comes out that the completeness the transition from i to j at t minus 1 t

837
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,260
transition from i to j at t minus 1 t what you need to do is the following

838
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:35,690
what you need to do is the following take the offer message computed i take

839
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:38,770
take the offer message computed i take the business is at P plus 1 computed J

840
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:40,910
the business is at P plus 1 computed J multiplied with the observation more

841
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:43,910
multiplied with the observation more than P plus 1 computed a and multiplying

842
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:49,490
than P plus 1 computed a and multiplying with the position let fix I'd say and

843
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,460
with the position let fix I'd say and actually if you remember with mastered

844
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:55,730
actually if you remember with mastered passing right when we wanted to find the

845
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:57,890
passing right when we wanted to find the Joint Distribution between two two

846
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:00,760
Joint Distribution between two two nights you know what we did is we took

847
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,770
nights you know what we did is we took that connects the two nights which is

848
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:06,770
that connects the two nights which is this times the evidenced and then we

849
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:08,690
this times the evidenced and then we took the message coming one more than

850
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:10,460
took the message coming one more than the rest come to the other note first

851
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,920
the rest come to the other note first unless is counting authority on one

852
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,450
unless is counting authority on one direction the message is coming at time

853
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,849
direction the message is coming at time T so actually lists exactly the same

854
00:58:16,849 --> 00:58:21,140
T so actually lists exactly the same equations when we did the propagation ok

855
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:25,900
equations when we did the propagation ok so there's nothing it's just what is

856
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:29,090
so there's nothing it's just what is know is that the variation is down in

857
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:31,099
know is that the variation is down in this rise with an elementary caution

858
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:33,109
this rise with an elementary caution without knowing very much about the

859
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:34,460
without knowing very much about the liberal foundation but all these a list

860
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:37,430
liberal foundation but all these a list of dates are only applicable to change

861
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,710
of dates are only applicable to change and in this case the hidden Markov

862
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,309
and in this case the hidden Markov models so

863
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:45,370
models so so if you want to complete this this

864
00:58:45,370 --> 00:59:06,789
so if you want to complete this this clothes moving joint for studio and then

865
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:09,400
clothes moving joint for studio and then you have to form a matrix between this

866
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,959
you have to form a matrix between this tab and doctor alright so basically you

867
00:59:13,959 --> 00:59:17,049
tab and doctor alright so basically you know this is shorten shortage of

868
00:59:17,049 --> 00:59:19,479
know this is shorten shortage of business let's say here in beta what's

869
00:59:19,479 --> 00:59:25,900
business let's say here in beta what's the vector okay metrics and then

870
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:57,999
the vector okay metrics and then basically okay so all of these things

871
00:59:57,999 --> 01:00:00,099
basically okay so all of these things are ready to go if you guys want to

872
01:00:00,099 --> 01:00:03,999
are ready to go if you guys want to program this and again you know you

873
01:00:03,999 --> 01:00:05,529
program this and again you know you don't like this and then whatever you

874
01:00:05,529 --> 01:00:08,199
don't like this and then whatever you have a nice level ization routine and

875
01:00:08,199 --> 01:00:10,829
have a nice level ization routine and you say now normalize so if you means

876
01:00:10,829 --> 01:00:13,599
you say now normalize so if you means you know it miss this evidence from the

877
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,669
you know it miss this evidence from the bottom and it's better not have to

878
01:00:15,669 --> 01:00:17,349
bottom and it's better not have to bother right keeping this track all the

879
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:18,939
bother right keeping this track all the time so you miss it you just come and be

880
01:00:18,939 --> 01:00:20,919
time so you miss it you just come and be normal eyes and actually that will give

881
01:00:20,919 --> 01:00:22,630
normal eyes and actually that will give you immediately what that value of the

882
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:28,120
you immediately what that value of the evidence all right

883
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:31,240
evidence all right so basically we use this to compute the

884
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:36,079
so basically we use this to compute the the sufficient statistics in in when we

885
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:48,650
the sufficient statistics in in when we did the you know the EMR growth since I

886
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:51,500
did the you know the EMR growth since I mentioned the Viterbi problem so let me

887
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,470
mentioned the Viterbi problem so let me go back to you

888
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:54,480


889
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,730
there is nothing new on what I'm going to say I'm gonna rewrite your question

890
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,829
to say I'm gonna rewrite your question again sure you guys can remember what we

891
01:01:00,829 --> 01:01:03,650
again sure you guys can remember what we were touching so we're interested to

892
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:06,829
were touching so we're interested to find the maximum of the posterior focus

893
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,230
find the maximum of the posterior focus if Adam was given all the data but in

894
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,549
if Adam was given all the data but in particularly in the View tab you see

895
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:14,599
particularly in the View tab you see which one is to find the observed or

896
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:15,829
which one is to find the observed or gives me that much

897
01:01:15,829 --> 01:01:18,920
gives me that much all right and this takes up its time or

898
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:23,450
all right and this takes up its time or many you know so this table is huge this

899
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:25,430
many you know so this table is huge this can you cannot go and say give me over

900
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:28,849
can you cannot go and say give me over stage and I would select one that much

901
01:01:28,849 --> 01:01:29,930
stage and I would select one that much mice the posterior

902
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:32,990
mice the posterior so now you need to find disease for

903
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:35,359
so now you need to find disease for which so that's the argument right there

904
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,789
which so that's the argument right there aren't much problem he'll find the

905
01:01:37,789 --> 01:01:40,039
aren't much problem he'll find the system maximize this posterior and we

906
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:41,450
system maximize this posterior and we resent that

907
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:44,839
resent that maximizing reagent is I think it will

908
01:01:44,839 --> 01:01:46,700
maximizing reagent is I think it will not give you a right answer so we need

909
01:01:46,700 --> 01:02:02,180
not give you a right answer so we need to maximize the given time step all

910
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:10,999
to maximize the given time step all right now edge weights

911
01:02:10,999 --> 01:02:11,009


912
01:02:11,009 --> 01:02:15,569
using the mission trip abused observationally and the transition will

913
01:02:15,569 --> 01:02:18,119
observationally and the transition will be made this and especially much demise

914
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:27,899
be made this and especially much demise we must my stuff okay this is the

915
01:02:27,899 --> 01:02:30,749
we must my stuff okay this is the stamping this is the probability of

916
01:02:30,749 --> 01:02:35,189
stamping this is the probability of being on you know a particular state one

917
01:02:35,189 --> 01:02:37,499
being on you know a particular state one this is the observation model of state

918
01:02:37,499 --> 01:02:40,399
this is the observation model of state one this is the transition probability

919
01:02:40,399 --> 01:02:43,199
one this is the transition probability between two time steps and this is the

920
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:52,439
between two time steps and this is the observation of time T and then this is

921
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:57,899
observation of time T and then this is you move from here to there and then you

922
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,209
you move from here to there and then you say what is the minimal way the populism

923
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:03,569
say what is the minimal way the populism in one maximal way basically and after

924
01:03:03,569 --> 01:03:06,659
in one maximal way basically and after the Derby part the algorithm is simple

925
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:09,179
the Derby part the algorithm is simple dynamic programming algorithm gonna go

926
01:03:09,179 --> 01:03:16,049
dynamic programming algorithm gonna go directly which is actually the same

927
01:03:16,049 --> 01:03:24,569
directly which is actually the same equation we have seen in this book

928
01:03:24,569 --> 01:03:30,869
equation we have seen in this book shalini divination hopefully things will

929
01:03:30,869 --> 01:03:32,999
shalini divination hopefully things will click and you remember whether the

930
01:03:32,999 --> 01:04:05,880
click and you remember whether the algorithms and tell me what that is

931
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:05,890


932
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:39,520
[Music]

933
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:39,530


934
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:58,250
- reflexive relation looking at that definition and tell me what this we have

935
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:29,070
definition and tell me what this we have a question says good

936
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:29,080


937
01:05:29,080 --> 01:06:35,940
memories don't it because then you will not understand okay so we took my square

938
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:57,030
not understand okay so we took my square ended in 2-1

939
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:57,040


940
01:06:57,040 --> 01:08:14,190
you know the taste and basically that give me the optimal

941
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:14,200


942
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:21,490
are we going to be able to count the correct answer at any stage don't

943
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:22,809
correct answer at any stage don't contaminate the other bills and then

944
01:08:22,809 --> 01:08:24,910
contaminate the other bills and then work backwards figure out what is the

945
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:31,180
work backwards figure out what is the path that led to God

946
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:31,190


947
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:37,160
I'm disgusted

948
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:37,170


949
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:45,340
so she was very urbanized they're just old little different

950
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:45,350


951
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:58,689
mystical optimizes Thanks versus note

952
01:08:58,689 --> 01:08:58,699


953
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:03,370
maybe this makes another nice homework by the way ok I see lots of nice chrome

954
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:05,739
by the way ok I see lots of nice chrome work ok something today

955
01:09:05,739 --> 01:10:09,939
work ok something today ok so actually you know and then minus

956
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:15,009
ok so actually you know and then minus one and then again city minus one I can

957
01:10:15,009 --> 01:10:17,529
one and then again city minus one I can one find the optimal SAT minus 2 until I

958
01:10:17,529 --> 01:10:23,649
one find the optimal SAT minus 2 until I find all the way back to step 1 ok so

959
01:10:23,649 --> 01:10:26,699
find all the way back to step 1 ok so actively what you need to do is you need

960
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:33,339
actively what you need to do is you need you know for anybody of like a 50 plus

961
01:10:33,339 --> 01:10:36,040
you know for anybody of like a 50 plus one you need to know what is the optimal

962
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:45,580
one you need to know what is the optimal value at the previous step

963
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:45,590


964
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:53,750
the states because the Chinese optimized but the optimal are the tape across run

965
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,830
but the optimal are the tape across run you will be able to go straight to that

966
01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:00,500
you will be able to go straight to that and then he will continue so the

967
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,210
and then he will continue so the previous step and the previous step on

968
01:11:02,210 --> 01:11:09,260
previous step and the previous step on tigress have one and then you are done

969
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:09,270


970
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:15,020
and in many primitive elements is you know is used in hundreds of different

971
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:18,020
know is used in hundreds of different applications right you may have heard

972
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:20,300
applications right you may have heard the term is a real person that we tell

973
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,310
the term is a real person that we tell the College of Engineering at the UST

974
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:28,330
the College of Engineering at the UST you know so so this is a real person

975
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:30,860
you know so so this is a real person with a real algorithm it has made lots

976
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:37,480
with a real algorithm it has made lots of impact in in computer science enjoy

977
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:37,490


978
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:45,350
the list there is an example basic of the absolutely and you may not you know

979
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:46,460
the absolutely and you may not you know maybe so it will give you another

980
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:50,570
maybe so it will give you another example similar to this let me see

981
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:52,370
example similar to this let me see whether it's just a schematic I can

982
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:56,210
whether it's just a schematic I can guide myself so here we have three

983
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:58,580
guide myself so here we have three states all right and this is the

984
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,200
states all right and this is the transition probabilities for the three

985
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,300
transition probabilities for the three states so if you know this state your

986
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,010
states so if you know this state your point three probability to remain this

987
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:07,580
point three probability to remain this page 0.7 to go to state two etc etc and

988
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:11,060
page 0.7 to go to state two etc etc and this time the observation probability so

989
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,490
this time the observation probability so if you know state 1 with probability

990
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:15,950
if you know state 1 with probability point 5 you can observe see one with

991
01:12:15,950 --> 01:12:18,380
point 5 you can observe see one with probability point two three two and with

992
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:21,980
probability point two three two and with probability 2/3 etc etc so you know the

993
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,900
probability 2/3 etc etc so you know the problem is asked you know if you know

994
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:27,260
problem is asked you know if you know that you start in state 3 1 right we

995
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,270
that you start in state 3 1 right we start from there and we have

996
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:32,120
start from there and we have observations because before everything

997
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,430
observations because before everything is a posterior probability so our

998
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:36,800
is a posterior probability so our observations have to answer presupposes

999
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,660
observations have to answer presupposes tricks in first steps

1000
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:42,950
tricks in first steps it is fidelity so we have observations

1001
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:47,450
it is fidelity so we have observations have G 1 2 3 4 6 6 we know the start

1002
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:50,210
have G 1 2 3 4 6 6 we know the start from state 1 we know the transition

1003
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:51,800
from state 1 we know the transition probabilities we know the observation

1004
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,840
probabilities we know the observation probabilities and tells you when to go

1005
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,850
probabilities and tells you when to go out the party let's actually on

1006
01:12:55,850 --> 01:13:02,120
out the party let's actually on extracting from a variable a lie that

1007
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,570
extracting from a variable a lie that you can know everything actually has

1008
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:08,210
you can know everything actually has education on probabilistic that they are

1009
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:11,270
education on probabilistic that they are very nicely written story recommend but

1010
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:13,940
very nicely written story recommend but when you have time and you have nothing

1011
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:19,470
when you have time and you have nothing else to do

1012
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:19,480


1013
01:13:19,480 --> 01:14:36,710
[Applause]

1014
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:36,720


1015
01:14:36,720 --> 01:15:51,410
this is

1016
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:51,420


1017
01:15:51,420 --> 01:16:27,030
right so you can see and eventually basically you can optimize when you

1018
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:29,150
basically you can optimize when you reach the entered a website figure out

1019
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:32,700
reach the entered a website figure out what is the optimal product in this case

1020
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:38,700
what is the optimal product in this case comes to be you know one to two and

1021
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,920
comes to be you know one to two and three I mean obviously this is a trivial

1022
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,770
three I mean obviously this is a trivial problem but you can appreciate trying to

1023
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:45,480
problem but you can appreciate trying to do this and much more complex scenario

1024
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,130
do this and much more complex scenario so there's a very interesting sort of

1025
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:52,890
so there's a very interesting sort of diving problem tomorrow

1026
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:59,490
diving problem tomorrow so the main hesitation so I you know any

1027
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:02,640
so the main hesitation so I you know any questions again usually the time to

1028
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,680
questions again usually the time to customize

1029
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:07,860
customize the available most of the days accepting

1030
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:12,030
the available most of the days accepting today ministers from relatives prepare

1031
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:15,870
today ministers from relatives prepare today but ok but tomorrow you can see me

1032
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:18,240
today but ok but tomorrow you can see me show you how to clear if not it will

1033
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:25,020
show you how to clear if not it will work right so I'll see you Paisley
