summing everything but the notes that belong without stopping so let's turn I

606
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:57,680
属于而不停下来，所以让我们轮到我不必经历所有这一切，所以
summing everything but the notes that belong without stopping so let's turn I

00:23:59,850 --> 00:23:59,860
属于而不停下来，所以让我们轮到我不必经历所有这一切，所以
don't have to go through all of this so I'm looking on the equation of the

609
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,340
我正在寻找底部的等式，所以我们正在寻找
don't have to go through all of this so I'm looking on the equation of the

610
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,700
我正在寻找底部的等式，所以我们正在寻找

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:11,340
的可能性
bottom all right so we're looking for the likelihood of of

613
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:11,440
我的观察结果中，我猜它们是绝对可能的

worked with the probability of one model this is very important the subscription

682
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,570
这很重要，因为当我们
worked with the probability of one model this is very important the subscription

683
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:45,490
这很重要，因为当我们
this is very important the subscription has been eliminated here right when we

684
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:45,500
这很重要，因为当我们

685
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
开始正确播放，所以这里有XV逗号n的可能性
has been eliminated here right when we start playing right so we have the

686
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,560
开始正确播放，所以这里有XV逗号n的可能性
start playing right so we have the probability of X V comma n here there is

699
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:17,930
此幻灯片记录了此日志，因此该产品将成为所有的总结
product is gonna become a summation all right we don't like this gonna end there

700
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,140
对，我们不喜欢这样会结束，所以这个词将成为一个
product is gonna become a summation all right we don't like this gonna end there

701
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:24,370
对，我们不喜欢这样会结束，所以这个词将成为一个
right we don't like this gonna end there so this term is going to become a

702
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:24,380
对，我们不喜欢这样会结束，所以这个词将成为一个
so this term is going to become a summation

703
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,760
求和增量函数将下降，
so this term is going to become a summation

704

求和增量函数将下降，
summation the delta function will come down and

705
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:28,230
求和增量函数将下降，
the delta function will come down and then we're going to have log of V of X V

706
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,200
那么给定theta，我们将获得XV的V的对数，这很好，因为这是
the delta function will come down and then we're going to have log of V of X V

707
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,040
那么给定theta，我们将获得XV的V的对数，这很好，因为这是

am checking how many times that exhibitions appear within my data set so

724
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:12,289
展览会出现在我的数据集中，所以这不是M XP的条款吗？
am checking how many times that exhibitions appear within my data set so

725
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:19,389
展览会出现在我的数据集中，所以这不是M XP的条款吗？

okay so basically if you look at this there

729
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:25,230
好吧，所以基本上，如果你在那里看
so basically if you look at this there is absolutely no end here now there's no

730
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:31,159
现在绝对没有尽头，没有模型的前身，我想画图

825
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:55,260
如此基本的家庭，您可以立即看到
so basically you can immediately see that this parameterization only comes

826
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,720
该参数化对于每个节点V仅出现一次，问题是
so basically you can immediately see that this parameterization only comes

827
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,810
该参数化对于每个节点V仅出现一次，问题是
that this parameterization only comes once for each node V the problem is

828
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:02,820
该参数化对于每个节点V仅出现一次，问题是
once for each node V the problem is convened a couple so we want to complete

829
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,840
召集了一对夫妇，所以我们想完成此参数，所以很明显，我们要
once for each node V the problem is convened a couple so we want to complete

830
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,970
召集了一对夫妇，所以我们想完成此参数，所以很明显，我们要

831
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:07,980
召集了一对夫妇，所以我们想完成此参数，所以很明显，我们要
this parameter so obviously we're going to maximize this but to maximize it we

832
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,400
为了最大程度地做到这一点，但要最大化它，我们所有人都应该有，所以孩子们我们应该脱钩
this parameter so obviously we're going to maximize this but to maximize it we

为了最大程度地做到这一点，但要最大化它，我们所有人都应该有，所以孩子们我们应该脱钩
all should have so children we decouple it right we're gonna maximize this with

835
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,630
是的，我们将与他们分别最大化，因为这
all should have so children we decouple it right we're gonna maximize this with

836
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,120
是的，我们将与他们分别最大化，因为这
it right we're gonna maximize this with them separately okay because this

837
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,130
是的，我们将与他们分别最大化，因为这
them separately okay because this parameters appear only in this term but

838
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,060
参数仅在此术语中出现，但我们需要小心，因为
them separately okay because this parameters appear only in this term but

839
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,760
参数仅在此术语中出现，但我们需要小心，因为
parameters appear only in this term but we need to be careful because since this

840
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:25,770
参数仅在此术语中出现，但我们需要小心，因为
we need to be careful because since this is for habilities conditional

841
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,500
是针对能力的条件概率，当您在XV中唱歌时，您拥有

849
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,210
你sominex三个最好站起来好吧，所以基本上你必须放一个
okay so basically you have to put a Lagrange multiplier and you want to

850
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,780
拉格朗日乘数，您想计算
okay so basically you have to put a Lagrange multiplier and you want to

00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,810
估计下标V，请记住，这确实是有条件的
estimate of theta subscript V and remember really this is the conditional

861
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:02,820
估计下标V，请记住，这确实是有条件的
remember really this is the conditional distribution of X V given its parents to

862
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,530
XV的分配给了它的父母为XP设置了一些值，因此
remember really this is the conditional distribution of X V given its parents to

863
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,990
XV的分配给了它的父母为XP设置了一些值，因此
distribution of X V given its parents to put some values for X P so values for

864
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:09,000
XV的分配给了它的父母为XP设置了一些值，因此
put some values for X P so values for the parents

865
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,710
我们在这里找的父母是
put some values for X P so values for the parents

866
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,680
我们在这里找的父母是
the parents that's what we're looking here is the

867
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:12,690
我们在这里找的父母是
that's what we're looking here is the partial count effects in the commonly

868
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,600
通常将部分计数效应除以X的部分计数就可以了
that's what we're looking here is the partial count effects in the commonly

869
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:24,380
通常将部分计数效应除以X的部分计数就可以了
partial count effects in the commonly divided by the partial count okay of X

870
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:24,750
对V的说法很有趣，但这很有意义，因此基本上
partial count effects in the commonly divided by the partial count okay of X

871
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:24,760
对V的说法很有趣，但这很有意义，因此基本上


872
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:31,110
对V的说法很有趣，但这很有意义，因此基本上
was fun to the parlance of V but that makes sense so basically the calculated

873
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:31,120
对V的说法很有趣，但这很有意义，因此基本上
makes sense so basically the calculated safety of analytics one clinician let a

874
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,230
分析的安全性一名临床医生让极端情况出现，这是错误的，您
makes sense so basically the calculated safety of analytics one clinician let a

875
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,480
分析的安全性一名临床医生让极端情况出现，这是错误的，您
safety of analytics one clinician let a extreme condition and it's wrong and you

876
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:36,490
分析的安全性一名临床医生让极端情况出现，这是错误的，您
extreme condition and it's wrong and you won't obey the parameters of that so

877
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,820
将不会遵守该参数，所以您在这里拥有的是
extreme condition and it's wrong and you won't obey the parameters of that so

878
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,860
将不会遵守该参数，所以您在这里拥有的是
won't obey the parameters of that so what you have here is you have an

879
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:40,870
将不会遵守该参数，所以您在这里拥有的是
what you have here is you have an electronic school and surpass muscles

electronic school and surpass muscles that the values have observed in your

882
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:46,990
电子学校，超越您在价值观中观察到的肌肉
that the values have observed in your data set for x1 and x2 divided by the

883
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:52,310
x1和x2的数据集除以您在或中具有的观测值
that the values have observed in your data set for x1 and x2 divided by the

884
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,980
x1和x2的数据集除以您在或中具有的观测值
data set for x1 and x2 divided by the observations that you have or in the

885
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:55,990
x1和x2的数据集除以您在或中具有的观测值
observations that you have or in the particular case if x1 is the comment

886
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,350
如果x1是基本上针对x1的计数的注释的特殊情况是

892
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:17,409
我的意思是，这是显而易见的答案，通常，如果您不明白这一点，
I mean this is the obvious answer and usually if you don't get the obvious

893
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:17,419
我的意思是，这是显而易见的答案，通常，如果您不明白这一点，
usually if you don't get the obvious answer you're doing something wrong

894
00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:19,990
回答您又在做错事了，这是针对离散分布的
usually if you don't get the obvious answer you're doing something wrong

896
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:23,980
回答您又在做错事了，这是针对离散分布的
again this is for discrete distributions okay and this is what you get so the

897
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,339
好的，这就是您得到的，所以最重要的是
again this is for discrete distributions okay and this is what you get so the

898
00:34:27,339 --> 00:34:29,710
好的，这就是您得到的，所以最重要的是
okay and this is what you get so the bottom line is this

899
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:29,720
好的，这就是您得到的，所以最重要的是
bottom line is this Emily estimate for direct graphical

900
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,569
艾米莉（Emily）对直接图形模型进行估算，夫妻俩还可以，您可以

models the couples okay and you can solve this problems basically for each

903
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:37,750
基本上分别为每个节点和这些部分计数解决此问题
models the couples okay and you can solve this problems basically for each

904
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,200
基本上分别为每个节点和这些部分计数解决此问题
solve this problems basically for each node separately and these partial counts

905
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:41,210
基本上分别为每个节点和这些部分计数解决此问题
node separately and these partial counts that you get is the sufficient

906
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,669
您获得的是您需要的足够的统计信息，其中包含所有
node separately and these partial counts that you get is the sufficient

有关此局部估计和Emily估计问题的信息
statistics that you need and contain all the information relevant to this local

910
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,720
有关此局部估计和Emily估计问题的信息
the information relevant to this local estimation and Emily estimation problem

911
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:49,730
有关此局部估计和Emily估计问题的信息
estimation and Emily estimation problem for long B so all this estimates are

912
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:55,089
对于长B，因此所有这些估计对于每个节点都是独立的，所以这
estimation and Emily estimation problem for long B so all this estimates are

913
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:56,889
对于长B，因此所有这些估计对于每个节点都是独立的，所以这
for long B so all this estimates are independent for each node so this

914
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:56,899
对于长B，因此所有这些估计对于每个节点都是独立的，所以这
independent for each node so this paradox now I know a definition in the

915
00:34:56,899 --> 00:35:02,349
矛盾的是，我现在知道影片中的班级定义，所以我们要说
independent for each node so this paradox now I know a definition in the

916
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:06,790
矛盾的是，我现在知道影片中的班级定义，所以我们要说
paradox now I know a definition in the class in in in the film so we will say

917
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:06,800
矛盾的是，我现在知道影片中的班级定义，所以我们要说
class in in in the film so we will say you know if you try to do this great

918
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,890
您知道现在是否尝试建立出色的模型和概率
class in in in the film so we will say you know if you try to do this great

919
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,220
您知道现在是否尝试建立出色的模型和概率
you know if you try to do this great models and this probabilities right now

920
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:11,230
您知道现在是否尝试建立出色的模型和概率
models and this probabilities right now very high-dimensional so you basically

921
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,960
非常高的尺寸，所以您基本上可以将桌子的非常高的尺寸
models and this probabilities right now very high-dimensional so you basically

922
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,790
非常高的尺寸，所以您基本上可以将桌子的非常高的尺寸
very high-dimensional so you basically the very high dimension of table to

923
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:15,800
非常高的尺寸，所以您基本上可以将桌子的非常高的尺寸
the very high dimension of table to describe this obviously that is not

924
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,270
形容这显然不是很实际
the very high dimension of table to describe this obviously that is not

925
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,440
形容这显然不是很实际
describe this obviously that is not going to be very practical

926
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:20,450
形容这显然不是很实际
going to be very practical I mean if X we can take PI values this

927
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,540
我的意思是，如果X我们可以取PI值，那么可以取20个值，您知道自己迷路了
going to be very practical I mean if X we can take PI values this

928
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,940
我的意思是，如果X我们可以取PI值，那么可以取20个值，您知道自己迷路了
I mean if X we can take PI values this can take 20 values you know you got lost

929
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:24,950
我的意思是，如果X我们可以取PI值，那么可以取20个值，您知道自己迷路了
can take 20 values you know you got lost okay so what you usually do is you

930
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,750
好吧，所以您通常要做的是用广义来近似
can take 20 values you know you got lost okay so what you usually do is you

931
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,740
好吧，所以您通常要做的是用广义来近似
okay so what you usually do is you approximate this with a generalized

932
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:29,750
好吧，所以您通常要做的是用广义来近似
approximate this with a generalized linear model so you could basically if

933
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,150
线性模型，因此，如果您将此分布与较少的链接，则基本上可以
approximate this with a generalized linear model so you could basically if

934
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,460
线性模型，因此，如果您将此分布与较少的链接，则基本上可以
linear model so you could basically if you link this distribution with fewer

935
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:36,470
线性模型，因此，如果您将此分布与较少的链接，则基本上可以
you link this distribution with fewer parameters in a generalized linear model

936
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:40,030
广义线性模型中的参数，因此我们已经展示了它们，您可以
you link this distribution with fewer parameters in a generalized linear model

937
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:44,559
广义线性模型中的参数，因此我们已经展示了它们，您可以
parameters in a generalized linear model and so in we have shown them you can go

938
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:44,569
广义线性模型中的参数，因此我们已经展示了它们，您可以
and so in we have shown them you can go and visit one of the lectures from the

939
00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:47,920
并参观了秋季学期的一堂课，我认为玛丽的书有
and so in we have shown them you can go and visit one of the lectures from the

940
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,040
并参观了秋季学期的一堂课，我认为玛丽的书有
and visit one of the lectures from the fall semester I think Mary's book has

941
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,050
并参观了秋季学期的一堂课，我认为玛丽的书有
fall semester I think Mary's book has this as well as an example you can show

942
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:54,480
这以及您可以显示的示例，在这种情况下，此归纳和
fall semester I think Mary's book has this as well as an example you can show

943
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,059
这以及您可以显示的示例，在这种情况下，此归纳和
this as well as an example you can show so in this case this generalizing and

944
00:35:58,059 --> 00:35:58,069
这以及您可以显示的示例，在这种情况下，此归纳和
so in this case this generalizing and what is corresponding to each node we

945
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:00,010
与我们解耦的每个节点对应的是什么
so in this case this generalizing and what is corresponding to each node we

946
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,859
与我们解耦的每个节点对应的是什么
what is corresponding to each node we are decoupled

947
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:01,869
与我们解耦的每个节点对应的是什么
are decoupled so you can complete the parameters of

948
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:04,530
因此您可以分别为每个模型分别完成每个模型的参数
are decoupled so you can complete the parameters of

949
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,510
因此您可以分别为每个模型分别完成每个模型的参数
so you can complete the parameters of each of these models separately for each

950
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:07,520
因此您可以分别为每个模型分别完成每个模型的参数
each of these models separately for each node

951
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,280
节点，您在以下方面没有很好的解决方案
each of these models separately for each node

952
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,950
节点，您在以下方面没有很好的解决方案
node and you didn't have a nice solution in

953
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:11,960
节点，您在以下方面没有很好的解决方案
and you didn't have a nice solution in terms of counts the way that you see

954
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,540
术语计算着您在这里看到的方式，因此您必须解决任何疗法
and you didn't have a nice solution in terms of counts the way that you see

955
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,710
术语计算着您在这里看到的方式，因此您必须解决任何疗法
terms of counts the way that you see here so you have to solve any therapy

956
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:17,720
术语计算着您在这里看到的方式，因此您必须解决任何疗法
here so you have to solve any therapy the way to discuss problem okay

957
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,920
讨论问题的方式好了，所以基本上您能得到的是什么，在哪里
here so you have to solve any therapy the way to discuss problem okay

958
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,580
讨论问题的方式好了，所以基本上您能得到的是什么，在哪里
the way to discuss problem okay so basically what you get is and where

959
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:24,590
讨论问题的方式好了，所以基本上您能得到的是什么，在哪里
so basically what you get is and where he describes problem that you solve

960
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,050
他描述了您迭代解决的问题，但是您可以执行此操作
so basically what you get is and where he describes problem that you solve

961
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,210
他描述了您迭代解决的问题，但是您可以执行此操作
he describes problem that you solve iteratively but you can do this

962
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:28,220
他描述了您迭代解决的问题，但是您可以执行此操作
iteratively but you can do this algorithm in parallel for its note so in

963
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:33,550
算法是并行的，因此从本质上讲，您仍然知道总数
iteratively but you can do this algorithm in parallel for its note so in

964
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,430
算法是并行的，因此从本质上讲，您仍然知道总数
algorithm in parallel for its note so in in essence you know the total still

965
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:36,440
算法是并行的，因此从本质上讲，您仍然知道总数
in essence you know the total still becomes even if you have a network of

966
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,130
即使您为此拥有一个表达游戏的网络，它也会变成
in essence you know the total still becomes even if you have a network of

967
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,600
即使您为此拥有一个表达游戏的网络，它也会变成
becomes even if you have a network of the game of expression for this

968
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:40,610
即使您为此拥有一个表达游戏的网络，它也会变成
the game of expression for this conditional distribution okay so the

969
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:48,130
有条件的分布还可以，所以我唯一要你不要忘记的地方
the game of expression for this conditional distribution okay so the

970
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,440
有条件的分布还可以，所以我唯一要你不要忘记的地方
conditional distribution okay so the only thing I want you to not forget here

971
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:50,450
有条件的分布还可以，所以我唯一要你不要忘记的地方
only thing I want you to not forget here is right but it says for completely

972
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,630
是正确的，但它表示对于完全观察到的数据集可以，所以您有
only thing I want you to not forget here is right but it says for completely

973
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,820
是正确的，但它表示对于完全观察到的数据集可以，所以您有
is right but it says for completely observed data sets all right so you have

974
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:54,830
是正确的，但它表示对于完全观察到的数据集可以，所以您有
observed data sets all right so you have begun everything is prescribed in the

975
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,040
开始了起草者规定的一切我什至不是身体，你能吗
observed data sets all right so you have begun everything is prescribed in the

976
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,160
开始了起草者规定的一切我什至不是身体，你能吗
begun everything is prescribed in the drafter I'm not even body can you just

977
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:00,170
开始了起草者规定的一切我什至不是身体，你能吗
drafter I'm not even body can you just if you have hidden variables since I

978
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,780
如果自从我开始以来你有隐藏的变量，我会在最后说些什么
drafter I'm not even body can you just if you have hidden variables since I

979
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,240
如果自从我开始以来你有隐藏的变量，我会在最后说些什么
if you have hidden variables since I start I said something intellectual last

980
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:04,250
如果自从我开始以来你有隐藏的变量，我会在最后说些什么
start I said something intellectual last time and we're going to come back on it

981
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,580

is it this is what I want to work with okay no twist there's no rule right I

1102
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,579
好吧，没有曲折，没有规则吧，我是说他们是一样的，但是这很多
okay no twist there's no rule right I mean they are the same but this is much

1103
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:26,589
好吧，没有曲折，没有规则吧，我是说他们是一样的，但是这很多
mean they are the same but this is much more elegant so the log of this is so

1104
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:34,529
更加优雅，所以它的日志是，所以我将在这里取日志
mean they are the same but this is much more elegant so the log of this is so

1105
00:41:34,529 --> 00:41:36,180
更加优雅，所以它的日志是，所以我将在这里取日志
more elegant so the log of this is so I'm going to take logs here summation in

1106
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,190
更加优雅，所以它的日志是，所以我将在这里取日志
I'm going to take logs here summation in N and then I have X V so summation on

1107
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:39,809
N，然后我有XV，所以小VI的所有配置的总和
I'm going to take logs here summation in N and then I have X V so summation on

1108
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:43,469
N，然后我有XV，所以小VI的所有配置的总和
N and then I have X V so summation on all configurations of little V I have

1109
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:43,479
N，然后我有XV，所以小VI的所有配置的总和
all configurations of little V I have people and exponents of the Delta

1110
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:45,390
三角函数的人和指数会一次又一次地出现
all configurations of little V I have people and exponents of the Delta

1111
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:48,989
三角函数的人和指数会一次又一次地出现
people and exponents of the Delta function will come in there and again

1112
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:48,999
三角函数的人和指数会一次又一次地出现
function will come in there and again what is this this is my count of XV in

1113
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:52,920
这是什么，这是我在数据步骤中对XV的计数
function will come in there and again what is this this is my count of XV in

1114
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,359
这是什么，这是我在数据步骤中对XV的计数
what is this this is my count of XV in my data step alright this is after now

1115
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:57,369
这是什么，这是我在数据步骤中对XV的计数
my data step alright this is after now it's identical with before nothing else

1116
00:41:57,369 --> 00:41:59,910
它与其他事物完全相同，因此分享就是与众不同，我认为
my data step alright this is after now it's identical with before nothing else

1117
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:03,359
它与其他事物完全相同，因此分享就是与众不同，我认为
it's identical with before nothing else so share is the difference and I think

1118
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:03,369
它与其他事物完全相同，因此分享就是与众不同，我认为
so share is the difference and I think this is what we work for the finish and

1119
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:06,630
这就是我们要完成的工作，而且可爱的符号略有不同
so share is the difference and I think this is what we work for the finish and

1120
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,849
这就是我们要完成的工作，而且可爱的符号略有不同
this is what we work for the finish and cutely with slightly different notation

1121
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:08,859
这就是我们要完成的工作，而且可爱的符号略有不同
cutely with slightly different notation so now what we do is we'll plug in this

1122
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:13,880
所以现在我们要做的是从我的无向图中插入这个优化
cutely with slightly different notation so now what we do is we'll plug in this

1123
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,370
所以现在我们要做的是从我的无向图中插入这个优化
so now what we do is we'll plug in this optimization from my undirected graph so

1124
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:17,380
所以现在我们要做的是从我的无向图中插入这个优化
optimization from my undirected graph so this is number one over Z over the

1125
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:22,170
这是我潜在图的点击次数超过Z的第一名
optimization from my undirected graph so this is number one over Z over the

1126
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,569
这是我潜在图的点击次数超过Z的第一名
this is number one over Z over the clicks on my graph of the potential side

1127
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:24,579
这是我潜在图的点击次数超过Z的第一名
clicks on my graph of the potential side C and immediately you appreciate the

1128
00:42:24,579 --> 00:42:27,089

C and immediately you appreciate the problem yes you get the summation over

1130
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:29,559
C并立即意识到问题，是的，求和
problem yes you get the summation over the logs of the potentials but also you

1131
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:32,700
势的对数，但是你也得到Z的对数，这是主要的
problem yes you get the summation over the logs of the potentials but also you

1132
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,029
势的对数，但是你也得到Z的对数，这是主要的
the logs of the potentials but also you get the log of Z and that's the main

1133
00:42:36,029 --> 00:42:36,039
势的对数，但是你也得到Z的对数，这是主要的
get the log of Z and that's the main should make in all of the rest of

1134
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:37,769
现在应该可以在所有其他图形水域中使用了
get the log of Z and that's the main should make in all of the rest of

1135
00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:42,209
现在应该可以在所有其他图形水域中使用了
should make in all of the rest of graphical waters ok now you get to

1136
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:42,219
现在应该可以在所有其他图形水域中使用了
graphical waters ok now you get to mission of mmm effectively and you

00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:46,600
这种关系在这里是诀窍，我认为我之前的业务是什么
business I think the text of ahead of my problem like X 1 X 2 X 2 X 3

1581
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,960
像X 1 X 2 X 2 X 3这样的问题
business I think the text of ahead of my problem like X 1 X 2 X 2 X 3

1582
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,060
像X 1 X 2 X 2 X 3这样的问题
problem like X 1 X 2 X 2 X 3 I took the empirical couch over this

1583
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:51,070
像X 1 X 2 X 2 X 3这样的问题
I took the empirical couch over this place so these are my empirical

1584
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:53,220
放置，所以这些不是我的经验知识，因为分裂
I took the empirical couch over this place so these are my empirical

1585
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,560
放置，所以这些不是我的经验知识，因为分裂
place so these are my empirical knowledge not and because the splits

1586
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:55,570
放置，所以这些不是我的经验知识，因为分裂
knowledge not and because the splits have another lost over this now the X 2

1587
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:58,020
X 2 I除以现在的边际
knowledge not and because the splits have another lost over this now the X 2

1588
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:02,910
X 2 I除以现在的边际
have another lost over this now the X 2 I divided by the marginal of now that

1589
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:03,780
好吧，因此下一波您实际上可以做这类事情的浪潮被称为
have another lost over this now the X 2 I divided by the marginal of now that

1590
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:03,790
好吧，因此下一波您实际上可以做这类事情的浪潮被称为


1591
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:09,150
好吧，因此下一波您实际上可以做这类事情的浪潮被称为
okay so the next wave you can actually do this type of things are called the

1592
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:09,160
好吧，因此下一波您实际上可以做这类事情的浪潮被称为
do this type of things are called the composable drops alright and so she's

1593
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:14,670
好的滴剂很好，所以她说得对，可以的玻璃杯还可以
do this type of things are called the composable drops alright and so she's

1594
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:18,360
好的滴剂很好，所以她说得对，可以的玻璃杯还可以
composable drops alright and so she's right the composable glass right okay

1595
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:18,370
好的滴剂很好，所以她说得对，可以的玻璃杯还可以
right the composable glass right okay and here's one glass that is not

1596
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:20,310
这是一个不可分解的杯子，您将无法
right the composable glass right okay and here's one glass that is not

1597
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:22,080
这是一个不可分解的杯子，您将无法
and here's one glass that is not decomposable for you won't be able to

1598
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:22,090
这是一个不可分解的杯子，您将无法
decomposable for you won't be able to actually do this trick so this idea of

1599
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:24,800
实际上是做这个技巧，所以这个从顶峰边缘开始的想法和
decomposable for you won't be able to actually do this trick so this idea of

1600
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,680
实际上是做这个技巧，所以这个从顶峰边缘开始的想法和
actually do this trick so this idea of starting with the pinnacle marginals and

1601
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:28,690
实际上是做这个技巧，所以这个从顶峰边缘开始的想法和
starting with the pinnacle marginals and trying to guess where the solution will

1602
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:30,480
试图猜测解决方案将不会真正应用于此问题的方法
starting with the pinnacle marginals and trying to guess where the solution will

1603
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,300
试图猜测解决方案将不会真正应用于此问题的方法
trying to guess where the solution will not actually apply to this problem okay

1604
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:33,310
试图猜测解决方案将不会真正应用于此问题的方法
not actually apply to this problem okay and and the reason is not because this

1605
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:37,650
而且原因不是因为它看起来不错，这无济于事
not actually apply to this problem okay and and the reason is not because this

1606
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:40,740
而且原因不是因为它看起来不错，这无济于事
and and the reason is not because this has a look all right this is nothing to

1607
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:40,750
而且原因不是因为它看起来不错，这无济于事
has a look all right this is nothing to do out at the end of the day you have a

1608
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:42,600
一天结束时去看看，但是这里有一个事实，那就是
has a look all right this is nothing to do out at the end of the day you have a

1609
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,970
一天结束时去看看，但是这里有一个事实，那就是
do out at the end of the day you have a look here but here's liver the fact that

1610
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:44,980
一天结束时去看看，但是这里有一个事实，那就是
look here but here's liver the fact that this what you see here is not a

1611
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:49,290
您在这里看到的不是可分解的下落，那是什么
look here but here's liver the fact that this what you see here is not a

1612
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:50,820
您在这里看到的不是可分解的下落，那是什么
this what you see here is not a decomposable drop so what's the

1613
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:50,830
您在这里看到的不是可分解的下落，那是什么
decomposable drop so what's the definition of a decomposable graph the

1614
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:53,880
分解图的定义如果可以的话，眼镜就成为可能
decomposable drop so what's the definition of a decomposable graph the

1615
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,070
分解图的定义如果可以的话，眼镜就成为可能
definition of a decomposable graph the glasses are become possible if we can

1616
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:56,080
分解图的定义如果可以的话，眼镜就成为可能
glasses are become possible if we can divide it into this joint into various

1617
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,370
把它分成这个关节，分成各种关节单元
glasses are become possible if we can divide it into this joint into various

1618
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:03,540
把它分成这个关节，分成各种关节单元
divide it into this joint into various joint cells adn s where s the parade a

1619
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:03,550
把它分成这个关节，分成各种关节单元
joint cells adn s where s the parade a and B and s is complete

1620
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,990
并且B和s是完整的subsuble知识属是集体的
joint cells adn s where s the parade a and B and s is complete

1621
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:08,640
并且B和s是完整的subsuble知识属是集体的
and B and s is complete chasuble knowledge genus are collective

1622
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:08,650
并且B和s是完整的subsuble知识属是集体的
chasuble knowledge genus are collective okay so if you look on this graph I can

1623
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:12,120
好吧，所以如果你看这张图，我可以将你从这方面的知识中分离出来
chasuble knowledge genus are collective okay so if you look on this graph I can

1624
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,710
好吧，所以如果你看这张图，我可以将你从这方面的知识中分离出来
okay so if you look on this graph I can divide you from this knowledge of this

1625
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:13,720
好吧，所以如果你看这张图，我可以将你从这方面的知识中分离出来
divide you from this knowledge of this node and that node and obviously in this

and x2 and x3 that are connected they separate x2 and x4

1635
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,670
将x2和x4分开，但是如果移至该图，则可以
and x2 and x3 that are connected they separate x2 and x4

1636
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:36,990
将x2和x4分开，但是如果移至该图，则可以
separate x2 and x4 but if you move to this graph you can

1637
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:37,000
将x2和x4分开，但是如果移至该图，则可以

1649
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:02,829
我将在本课程中讨论的内容
this in this course remember when we do will the very early

1650
01:02:02,829 --> 01:02:06,250
记得当我们做的时候会在课程的最初阶段做一个图表
this in this course remember when we do will the very early

1652
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:08,809
记得当我们做的时候会在课程的最初阶段做一个图表
part of the course we were doing a graph elimination so nothing that you do graph

1653
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:11,440
消除，因此您无需在此处进行图消除的任何操作，并非如此
part of the course we were doing a graph elimination so nothing that you do graph

1654
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,000
消除，因此您无需在此处进行图消除的任何操作，并非如此
elimination so nothing that you do graph elimination here right and it's not

1655
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,010
消除，因此您无需在此处进行图消除的任何操作，并非如此
elimination here right and it's not eliminating any note it doesn't matter

1656
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:16,000
消除任何音符并不重要，它们都是对称的，所以如果您发光
elimination here right and it's not eliminating any note it doesn't matter

1657
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,190
消除任何音符并不重要，它们都是对称的，所以如果您发光
eliminating any note it doesn't matter they're all symmetric so if you luminate

1658
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:18,200
消除任何音符并不重要，它们都是对称的，所以如果您发光
they're all symmetric so if you luminate explore what do you need to go to the

1659
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,530
探索您需要进行下一步操作的内容，如果需要对此进行分析
they're all symmetric so if you luminate explore what do you need to go to the

1660
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:28,930
探索您需要进行下一步操作的内容，如果需要对此进行分析

1670
01:02:50,049 --> 01:02:50,059
它们与结点3的输出直接链接好，所以如果图形是

trivial all right and there is more discussion in the launch

1674
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:56,530
在启动中进行讨论好的，所以它说如果图形不是

1675
01:02:56,530 --> 01:03:03,400
在启动中进行讨论好的，所以它说如果图形不是

1676
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:03,410
在启动中进行讨论好的，所以它说如果图形不是
ok ok so it says if the graph is not become possible basically there's

1677
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:04,930
成为可能，基本上，现在你无能为力
ok ok so it says if the graph is not become possible basically there's

nothing you can do with the present curve of the immediate so we need to do

1680
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,730
立即数的曲线，所以我们需要做得更好，因为时间是
nothing you can do with the present curve of the immediate so we need to do

1682
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:12,410
立即数的曲线，所以我们需要做得更好，因为时间是
something better so since the time is clicking so let's see what we will do if

1683
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:15,490
单击，让我们看看如果图是遗传算法，我们将如何处理
something better so since the time is clicking so let's see what we will do if

1684
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:18,069
单击，让我们看看如果图是遗传算法，我们将如何处理
clicking so let's see what we will do if the algorithm if graph is a genetic

1685
01:03:18,069 --> 01:03:18,079
单击，让我们看看如果图是遗传算法，我们将如何处理
the algorithm if graph is a genetic graph and we cannot use this the

1686
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:22,450
图，我们不能使用这个组成基本上成为可能
the algorithm if graph is a genetic graph and we cannot use this the

1688
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:24,440
图，我们不能使用这个组成基本上成为可能
composition become possibility basically of the graph so we're going to develop

1689
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,440
的图形，所以我们要进行评估，我们称其为疗法
composition become possibility basically of the graph so we're going to develop

我们的女服务员还记得什么时候我们采用对数似然的梯度
took the gradient of the log likelihood we basically regret the use this pair -

1701
01:03:47,109 --> 01:03:52,210
我们基本上后悔使用这对-绝望你还记得我们说过

we basically regret the use this pair - despair you remember we said that

1703
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:55,730
我们基本上后悔使用这对-绝望你还记得我们说过
despair you remember we said that child-sized cancel out so you know now

1704
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:58,450
儿童尺寸的取消，所以您现在知道我们要去伙计们

具有潜在变量基本上，您需要做的是
remain constant right and again if you have latent variables basically what you

2058
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:11,240
具有潜在变量基本上，您需要做的是
have latent variables basically what you need to do is that for the rest of the

2059
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:11,250
具有潜在变量基本上，您需要做的是
need to do is that for the rest of the wacky graphs you can apply exactly the

2060
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,340
古怪的图，您可以应用与今天需要讨论的图完全相同的图，但是您
need to do is that for the rest of the wacky graphs you can apply exactly the

2061
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:15,980
古怪的图，您可以应用与今天需要讨论的图完全相同的图，但是您
wacky graphs you can apply exactly the same that needs to discuss today but you

2062
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:15,990
古怪的图，您可以应用与今天需要讨论的图完全相同的图，但是您
same that needs to discuss today but you apply them artistic iteration of the e/m

2063
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:18,320
将它们向外应用e / m的艺术迭代，这样您就可以真正做到这一点
same that needs to discuss today but you apply them artistic iteration of the e/m

2064
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,140
将它们向外应用e / m的艺术迭代，这样您就可以真正做到这一点
apply them artistic iteration of the e/m outwards so really you can do this for

2065
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:21,150
将它们向外应用e / m的艺术迭代，这样您就可以真正做到这一点
outwards so really you can do this for any problem with hidden variables very

2066
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:24,770
隐藏变量的任何问题都很简单的方法来估计参数
outwards so really you can do this for any problem with hidden variables very

2067
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:27,170
隐藏变量的任何问题都很简单的方法来估计参数
any problem with hidden variables very simple way to estimate the parameters

2068
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:27,180
隐藏变量的任何问题都很简单的方法来估计参数
simple way to estimate the parameters assuming that you have complete data

2069
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,700
假设您有完整的数据描述，如果市民说不，
simple way to estimate the parameters assuming that you have complete data

2070
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:37,670
假设您有完整的数据描述，如果市民说不，
assuming that you have complete data description all right if civics says no

2071
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:37,680
假设您有完整的数据描述，如果市民说不，
description all right if civics says no we have noticed they know no lecture on

2072
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,710
我们注意到他们不知道星期五没有演讲，好吧，我打算说，如果我们
description all right if civics says no we have noticed they know no lecture on

2073
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:44,540
我们注意到他们不知道星期五没有演讲，好吧，我打算说，如果我们
we have noticed they know no lecture on Friday okay and I'm going to maybe if we

2074
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:44,550
我们注意到他们不知道星期五没有演讲，好吧，我打算说，如果我们
Friday okay and I'm going to maybe if we have a lecture next Friday but there's

2075
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:47,210
下个星期五有个演讲会，但是星期二和星期四没有个演讲会
Friday okay and I'm going to maybe if we have a lecture next Friday but there's

2076
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:49,690
下个星期五有个演讲会，但是星期二和星期四没有个演讲会
have a lecture next Friday but there's no lecture on Tuesday and Thursday okay

2077
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:49,700
下个星期五有个演讲会，但是星期二和星期四没有个演讲会
no lecture on Tuesday and Thursday okay all right

2078
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,719
好吧，等等，所以我们下次见
no lecture on Tuesday and Thursday okay all right

2079
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:56,909
好吧，等等，所以我们下次见
all right so and and and so we'll see you next

2080
01:16:56,909 --> 01:16:56,919
好吧，等等，所以我们下次见
so and and and so we'll see you next week

2081
01:16:56,919 --> 01:16:59,130
星期
so and and and so we'll see you next week
