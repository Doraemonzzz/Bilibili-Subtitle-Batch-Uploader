1
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,870
all right I hope you survive the last two lectures and I'm assuming the topics

2
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,800
two lectures and I'm assuming the topics that needed to be covered were covered

3
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,170
that needed to be covered were covered so I'm not you know I have not received

4
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,090
so I'm not you know I have not received any note contrary to God so we have

5
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,630
any note contrary to God so we have accuracy dual lectures some of them are

6
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,809
accuracy dual lectures some of them are they may sound a little review but

7
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:55,850
they may sound a little review but hopefully we will do some new things in

8
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,820
hopefully we will do some new things in between and today I want to just go back

9
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,460
between and today I want to just go back to a directly graphical models because

10
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,610
to a directly graphical models because basically they are the graphical models

11
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,809
basically they are the graphical models of more importance for scientific

12
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:12,740
of more importance for scientific applications okay so we need to to cover

13
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,960
applications okay so we need to to cover a few things in details reminder not

14
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,009
a few things in details reminder not next week next next week all the

15
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:23,870
next week next next week all the presentations in the class are going to

16
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,320
presentations in the class are going to start and I'm gonna be randomly picking

17
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,289
start and I'm gonna be randomly picking names and we're saying you you and you

18
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:32,360
names and we're saying you you and you today you you tomorrow

19
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,270
today you you tomorrow okay so don't send me in the quest and

20
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,610
okay so don't send me in the quest and say please can I speak the last can I do

21
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:42,140
say please can I speak the last can I do this can I do that you know and I think

22
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,319
this can I do that you know and I think your presentations it will be useful if

23
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:50,660
your presentations it will be useful if you a day before you actually speak the

24
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,690
you a day before you actually speak the the papers we can make them to be view

25
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,310
the papers we can make them to be view basically at the end of the semester so

26
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,680
basically at the end of the semester so that's where you have a few more weeks

27
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,710
that's where you have a few more weeks to write the actual six pages okay but

28
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,539
to write the actual six pages okay but there's no point of giving a

29
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:04,520
there's no point of giving a presentation then say please see revise

30
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,400
presentation then say please see revise presentation of course if the

31
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,370
presentation of course if the presentation and the paper don't agree

32
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,370
presentation and the paper don't agree in content we're in trouble

33
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,020
in content we're in trouble okay so don't bother basically

34
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,420
okay so don't bother basically submitting them if they are not on the

35
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,680
submitting them if they are not on the same on the same frequency

36
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:21,690


37
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,780
now next week is the scientific meeting I am NOT going to be here I have an idea

38
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,290
I am NOT going to be here I have an idea it's avec is going to be here so we may

39
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,230
it's avec is going to be here so we may have a lecture on Friday if I make it on

40
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,930
have a lecture on Friday if I make it on time but for sure I'm not here Tuesday

41
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:50,120
time but for sure I'm not here Tuesday and Thursday okay

42
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,130


43
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,070
so actually for this would be most probably more than one lecture I don't

44
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,550
probably more than one lecture I don't know how much we're going to cover today

45
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,930
know how much we're going to cover today the price for three lectures but the

46
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,610
the price for three lectures but the thing I don't have that luxury strong a

47
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,230
thing I don't have that luxury strong a maximum of two lectures this palace

48
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,210
maximum of two lectures this palace it's after nineteen from reqtest book

49
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,020
it's after nineteen from reqtest book and also taught the spelling seven from

50
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,480
and also taught the spelling seven from colors and Friedman PGM book okay so

51
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,490
colors and Friedman PGM book okay so they're both excellent reached all right

52
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,100
they're both excellent reached all right and as I said for those in who work in

53
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,170
and as I said for those in who work in science and engineering this is a very

54
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:29,080
science and engineering this is a very relevant topic so we may give you

55
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,930
relevant topic so we may give you basically minders and we'll try to to

56
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,690
basically minders and we'll try to to revisit a few concepts so what you see

57
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,120
revisit a few concepts so what you see on the top is an example of a directed

58
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,120
on the top is an example of a directed graph right and on the bottom we see an

59
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,060
graph right and on the bottom we see an undirected version of this where you

60
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,220
undirected version of this where you notice we have done what with the

61
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,850
notice we have done what with the buzzword what it is

62
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,680
buzzword what it is modernization so we have moralized the

63
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,310
modernization so we have moralized the parlance so for example seven has three

64
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,440
parlance so for example seven has three parents right and you notice four five

65
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,040
parents right and you notice four five and six

66
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,950
and six basically we linked them similarly five

67
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,150
basically we linked them similarly five has two parents two and three and we

68
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,240
has two parents two and three and we made them now we will say that when you

69
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,120
made them now we will say that when you mobilize it doesn't by any way imply

70
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,810
mobilize it doesn't by any way imply that whatever conditioning dependence

71
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,520
that whatever conditioning dependence relationship for the graph on the top

72
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,050
relationship for the graph on the top you are going to have the same relations

73
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,960
you are going to have the same relations on the graph on the bottom and this can

74
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,450
on the graph on the bottom and this can be an issue I mean it's easier to work

75
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,640
be an issue I mean it's easier to work with this model right and today we're

76
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,920
with this model right and today we're actually going to be talking about

77
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,500
actually going to be talking about undirected graphs okay so there is a

78
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,660
undirected graphs okay so there is a merit to do this but you need to be

79
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,150
merit to do this but you need to be aware but the conditional relations here

80
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,620
aware but the conditional relations here they are not the same as the ops on the

81
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,580
they are not the same as the ops on the bottom not always all right so why do we

82
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,580
bottom not always all right so why do we need to understand undirected graphical

83
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,110
need to understand undirected graphical models there is just example

84
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,490
models there is just example think

85
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,180
think about the the knowledge the longer

86
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,090
about the the knowledge the longer variables in your graph let's say the

87
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,930
variables in your graph let's say the pixel bodies in an image it doesn't make

88
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,990
pixel bodies in an image it doesn't make a sense to actually put directions with

89
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,970
a sense to actually put directions with us the elections being an image right

90
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,210
us the elections being an image right the this pixel effects is the parent of

91
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,700
the this pixel effects is the parent of that pixel and that is the size of our

92
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,530
that pixel and that is the size of our picture what does that mean it doesn't

93
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,880
picture what does that mean it doesn't mean anything so we only there's no

94
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,960
mean anything so we only there's no meaning to actually use a direct

95
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,300
meaning to actually use a direct graphical model it's a in the context of

96
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,670
graphical model it's a in the context of famous analysis and more importantly

97
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,330
famous analysis and more importantly it's not relevant to use it in this huge

98
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,540
it's not relevant to use it in this huge field of special statistics okay you

99
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,600
field of special statistics okay you have to be try to model correlations in

100
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,510
have to be try to model correlations in a special domain so I'll give you an

101
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,960
a special domain so I'll give you an example and to indicate basically how

102
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,720
example and to indicate basically how different things can be between

103
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,700
different things can be between directed graphical models and undirected

104
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,140
directed graphical models and undirected graphical model so let's go sit right on

105
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,220
graphical model so let's go sit right on no date okay so this is you can think of

106
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,770
no date okay so this is you can think of this as an image and this have the pixel

107
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,570
this as an image and this have the pixel values right which we take them to be

108
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,610
values right which we take them to be rondo and let's say we put some arrows

109
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,320
rondo and let's say we put some arrows the way that you secure all this grade

110
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,180
the way that you secure all this grade okay so we look on node X a can you tell

111
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,600
okay so we look on node X a can you tell me just looking at this graft all of

112
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,360
me just looking at this graft all of this other knowledge that you see there

113
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,490
this other knowledge that you see there all together what are they what do can

114
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,980
all together what are they what do can we assign them a name in the context of

115
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,840
we assign them a name in the context of the node X a and Y so it's very

116
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,590
the node X a and Y so it's very carefully all of this knows by the sound

117
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,080
carefully all of this knows by the sound excited except of course Mira can see

118
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,920
excited except of course Mira can see here x2 right it isn't an all together

119
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,490
here x2 right it isn't an all together what are they in the context of x8

120
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:35,500


121
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:43,920
the make a blanket okay so the market includes the parents includes the

122
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,790
includes the parents includes the children and what our x12 and explore

123
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,690
children and what our x12 and explore the corporates okay

124
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,310
the corporates okay obviously is not included right so the

125
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,410
obviously is not included right so the idea obviously of the Markov blanket is

126
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,940
idea obviously of the Markov blanket is that we know the values of the Markov

127
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,740
that we know the values of the Markov blanket of this Novak's a then extract

128
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,510
blanket of this Novak's a then extract is conditionally independent of anything

129
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:11,010
is conditionally independent of anything else in the ground okay so obviously we

130
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,820
else in the ground okay so obviously we have to look very carefully on all this

131
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,610
have to look very carefully on all this grid here to say yes this is the Markov

132
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,490
grid here to say yes this is the Markov blanket but x2 is not included the x14

133
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,380
blanket but x2 is not included the x14 is not included okay so let's look now

134
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,510
is not included okay so let's look now the undirected graph the Markov blanket

135
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,410
the undirected graph the Markov blanket is only those four nodes the neighbors

136
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,500
is only those four nodes the neighbors because you remember conditional

137
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,940
because you remember conditional independence basically in an undirected

138
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,150
independence basically in an undirected graph is defined by the neighbor so if

139
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,410
graph is defined by the neighbor so if you describe the values of these

140
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,870
you describe the values of these neighbors right x8 is independent

141
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,120
neighbors right x8 is independent anything else because if you look this

142
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,060
anything else because if you look this if you think of this operation the graph

143
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,310
if you think of this operation the graph from excited to any other node you have

144
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,320
from excited to any other node you have to go through this neighbors this Markov

145
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,500
to go through this neighbors this Markov blanket and and and if this are observed

146
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:05,360
blanket and and and if this are observed got blocked okay so point is this

147
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,620
got blocked okay so point is this condition independence relations in the

148
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,980
condition independence relations in the context of undirected graphs are very

149
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,130
context of undirected graphs are very simpler than what you see with a

150
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,960
simpler than what you see with a directed graph so obviously there is a

151
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,140
directed graph so obviously there is a merit to actually work with undirected

152
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:25,530
merit to actually work with undirected graphs so if you want SQ advantages and

153
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:30,390
graphs so if you want SQ advantages and disadvantages so the undirected graphs

154
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,120
disadvantages so the undirected graphs have symmetric you noticed when you look

155
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,280
have symmetric you noticed when you look for example for the neighbors is not

156
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,750
for example for the neighbors is not like this is the father

157
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,700
like this is the father there is norian tation this is the kids

158
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,860
there is norian tation this is the kids we start the comparison you don't have

159
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,520
we start the comparison you don't have anything like that

160
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,000
anything like that everything allowed to know the symmetric

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,310
everything allowed to know the symmetric alright so in the context of special

162
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,400
alright so in the context of special statistics is very relevant we will say

163
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,730
statistics is very relevant we will say it not today on Thursday that when you

164
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,480
it not today on Thursday that when you discuss this cumulative analysis so when

165
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,290
discuss this cumulative analysis so when you try to produce models P of Y given X

166
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,139
you try to produce models P of Y given X and this we will do this in the context

167
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:06,560
and this we will do this in the context of conditional random fields you know

168
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,610
of conditional random fields you know the you know undirected graphical models

169
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,560
the you know undirected graphical models are very appropriate this is very

170
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,410
are very appropriate this is very difficult to do with directly graphical

171
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:21,500
difficult to do with directly graphical models we have disadvantages in memory

172
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,840
models we have disadvantages in memory we will revisit this today the

173
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,310
we will revisit this today the privatization of the joint probability

174
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,470
privatization of the joint probability distribution in a direct graphic of

175
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,939
distribution in a direct graphic of Morgan's in terms of tricks right

176
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,699
Morgan's in terms of tricks right there's no physical meaning they're not

177
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:34,579
there's no physical meaning they're not make probabilities you know so you

178
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:37,730
make probabilities you know so you cannot really interpret things as easy

179
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,930
cannot really interpret things as easy as you do with directed graphical models

180
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,060
as you do with directed graphical models and the parameters that are involved in

181
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,710
and the parameters that are involved in the clinics are very difficult to

182
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,420
the clinics are very difficult to compute so the others are little bit

183
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,710
compute so the others are little bit more complicated even and again we may

184
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,250
more complicated even and again we may see this today or on our first day when

185
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,639
see this today or on our first day when you work with direct graphical models

186
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:00,230
you work with direct graphical models and naturally local probabilities like

187
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,420
and naturally local probabilities like the parameters are not given spotters

188
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,150
the parameters are not given spotters are normalized this is not the case from

189
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,430
are normalized this is not the case from direct graphical models so the

190
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,860
direct graphical models so the normalization requires actually to work

191
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,960
normalization requires actually to work with all the clicks everywhere and that

192
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,660
with all the clicks everywhere and that is a very computationally difficult

193
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,840
is a very computationally difficult problem ok actually most of the

194
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,639
problem ok actually most of the algorithms have difficulties just

195
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:22,040
algorithms have difficulties just because of computing properly the

196
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,330
because of computing properly the normalization factor

197
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:27,340


198
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:38,380
so in an undirected graphs the only conditional relation that we basically

199
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,960
conditional relation that we basically have played with is what you see here

200
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,170
have played with is what you see here defined with the separation so X a is

201
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,420
defined with the separation so X a is independent of X B given X C right when

202
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,210
independent of X B given X C right when any power from x-a to x-b has to go

203
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,820
any power from x-a to x-b has to go through XC okay and this is what we call

204
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,080
through XC okay and this is what we call a normal market property right so for

205
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,440
a normal market property right so for example if you look at nodes 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 6 &amp;

206
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:02,920
example if you look at nodes 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 7

207
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,790
7 they're conditionally independent from I

208
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,040
they're conditionally independent from I mean 1 2 &amp; 6 7 or addition independent

209
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,970
mean 1 2 &amp; 6 7 or addition independent given 3 4 &amp; 5

210
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,180
given 3 4 &amp; 5 because to go from one or two to six or

211
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,760
because to go from one or two to six or seven you every part has to grow through

212
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,850
seven you every part has to grow through 3 5 &amp; 4 so that's the global Markov

213
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:25,360
3 5 &amp; 4 so that's the global Markov property the these geometrical property

214
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,740
property the these geometrical property is basically defined in terms of the

215
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,530
is basically defined in terms of the immediate neighbors of a node so if you

216
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,360
immediate neighbors of a node so if you fix their immediate neighbors that's the

217
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,060
fix their immediate neighbors that's the Markov blanket basically this node

218
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,220
Markov blanket basically this node becomes separated from where the other

219
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,680
becomes separated from where the other nodes okay so this is the local property

220
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,310
nodes okay so this is the local property so you just look at the nodes of of the

221
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,530
so you just look at the nodes of of the neighbors of the node and then there is

222
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:56,650
neighbors of the node and then there is ok so here's one example one is so

223
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,020
ok so here's one example one is so different or three one is independent of

224
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,520
different or three one is independent of the other node all right

225
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,940
the other node all right because again 23 are the neighbors of

226
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,100
because again 23 are the neighbors of fun once you block them there is no path

227
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,690
fun once you block them there is no path to go from 1 to any corrupt and and then

228
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,940
to go from 1 to any corrupt and and then you have this paralyzed Markov property

229
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,140
you have this paralyzed Markov property all right

230
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:22,890
all right so if so if yes again your neighbors so

231
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,150
so if so if yes again your neighbors so financial condition independent given

232
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,070
financial condition independent given the rest if there is not direct edge

233
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,230
the rest if there is not direct edge between them okay

234
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,299
between them okay notes are conditionally dependent given

235
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:36,980
notes are conditionally dependent given the rest right if there's no s between

236
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,189
the rest right if there's no s between them can you sit up I mean if the amount

237
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:43,759
them can you sit up I mean if the amount of dissipation is so let's say I'm

238
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,030
of dissipation is so let's say I'm looking at the note 6 8 and X 9 and all

239
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,009
looking at the note 6 8 and X 9 and all the other notes of things all right

240
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:53,960
the other notes of things all right obviously there is a path from X 8 X 9

241
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,689
obviously there is a path from X 8 X 9 on this plot all right so the only way

242
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,189
on this plot all right so the only way you can make this independent if there

243
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,079
you can make this independent if there is no link and that's why this is called

244
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,139
is no link and that's why this is called a pairwise markov property so for

245
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:07,939
a pairwise markov property so for example is X 7 X 13th independent given

246
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:13,189
example is X 7 X 13th independent given everything else is X 7 and X 13

247
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:20,250
everything else is X 7 and X 13 independent given all of the other no

248
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:20,260


249
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:33,000
yes or no yes okay so and the proof is given in the big Bible on Modest by :

250
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,820
given in the big Bible on Modest by : the serpent is the global properties

251
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,890
the serpent is the global properties these pairwise and the local property

252
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,320
these pairwise and the local property they're all equivalent so if you start

253
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,720
they're all equivalent so if you start on you can saw the other two it's not an

254
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,380
on you can saw the other two it's not an honest theorem and the blue-faced is not

255
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,250
honest theorem and the blue-faced is not very tricky but you know not well I

256
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,590
very tricky but you know not well I believe actually talk very well that it

257
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,240
believe actually talk very well that it was never formally published anywhere

258
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,670
was never formally published anywhere but is given in the book that you can

259
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:05,430
but is given in the book that you can read you know nationally beginning that

260
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,050
read you know nationally beginning that conditional independence relations

261
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,810
conditional independence relations between you know when you memorize the

262
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,620
between you know when you memorize the graph basically if you don't maintain

263
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,750
graph basically if you don't maintain the same condition independent relations

264
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,700
the same condition independent relations between the director of directed graph

265
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:23,220
between the director of directed graph and they take example is a directed

266
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,150
and they take example is a directed graph that looks like this okay you

267
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,100
graph that looks like this okay you remember this for example the explaining

268
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,530
remember this for example the explaining away and the undirected version that

269
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:37,410
away and the undirected version that looks like that okay so so for example

270
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,530
looks like that okay so so for example on this graph right with this separation

271
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,050
on this graph right with this separation which depicts be there's no path from A

272
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,600
which depicts be there's no path from A to C sorry a and C are independent here

273
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,960
to C sorry a and C are independent here if you fix B a and C B come

274
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,550
if you fix B a and C B come conditionally independent you remember

275
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,110
conditionally independent you remember so if you do not be a in still

276
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,230
so if you do not be a in still independent but if you know be alright

277
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,470
independent but if you know be alright and in C complete to explain be okay and

278
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,660
and in C complete to explain be okay and that's what the dependence comes so

279
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,260
that's what the dependence comes so immediately you can see that this

280
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,940
immediately you can see that this condition and dependence relations are

281
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,910
condition and dependence relations are not the same between the directed and

282
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:20,780
not the same between the directed and sort of the equivalent directed god so

283
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,670
sort of the equivalent directed god so visualization and I'm going to show you

284
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,260
visualization and I'm going to show you the maximum organization does not

285
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,910
the maximum organization does not maintaining the conditional independent

286
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,640
maintaining the conditional independent properties of the directed graph so

287
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,910
properties of the directed graph so let's briefly see this this directed

288
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,680
let's briefly see this this directed graph and the corresponding mobilized

289
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,860
graph and the corresponding mobilized undirected block so will be a blueish we

290
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:48,510
undirected block so will be a blueish we have given to what is still given 2005

291
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,400
have given to what is still given 2005 alright given two four and five are

292
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,150
alright given two four and five are conditioned independent right okay so

293
00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:00,960
conditioned independent right okay so let's look here given to two and five

294
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,170
let's look here given to two and five not conditioned independent was not

295
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,180


296
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,820
because you can actually go to 5 through 6

297
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,990
6 remember conditional independence

298
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,820
remember conditional independence relationships all of directed graphs is

299
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:23,380
relationships all of directed graphs is is this I call this this what was there

300
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,080
is this I call this this what was there was more experiment right so you can

301
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,970
was more experiment right so you can actually if you were to 5 through 6

302
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,390
actually if you were to 5 through 6 right nothing is blocked so Claire is

303
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,840
right nothing is blocked so Claire is not independent of heart so we can

304
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,610
not independent of heart so we can actually fix this and make circle for

305
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,320
actually fix this and make circle for this bar to have sort of similar

306
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,700
this bar to have sort of similar conditional independence relationships

307
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,890
conditional independence relationships with an undirected version and the

308
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,130
with an undirected version and the answer is yes so let's look at this

309
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,320
answer is yes so let's look at this example with a little bit more detail

310
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,310
example with a little bit more detail here right so it says give you two turns

311
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,780
here right so it says give you two turns out they are not independent

312
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:06,280
out they are not independent okay now is in this diagram that makes

313
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,340
okay now is in this diagram that makes this relation to be destroyed can you

314
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,880
this relation to be destroyed can you look shorter form tell be working in

315
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,230
look shorter form tell be working in that undirected graph is responsible for

316
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,470
that undirected graph is responsible for violating this independence relation in

317
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,940
violating this independence relation in other ways work between more

318
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,970
other ways work between more but somehow resulted on five not being

319
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,460
but somehow resulted on five not being independent of five given for not being

320
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,759
independent of five given for not being independent five given to which link is

321
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:41,600
independent five given to which link is there but creating the problems

322
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:41,610


323
00:19:41,610 --> 00:20:22,030
the pants of seven arginine 26 there's let's make them in this condition in the

324
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,040


325
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,590
penalizing four and six and then this conditional independence relationship

326
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,510
conditional independence relationship that we have on the Left will also be a

327
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,230
that we have on the Left will also be a block so here's what you need to do if

328
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,030
block so here's what you need to do if you want to prove a conditional

329
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,820
you want to prove a conditional independence if you say now pay and B

330
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:45,290
independence if you say now pay and B given C you only kid so you started off

331
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,540
given C you only kid so you started off the pony has denotes a B and C that we

332
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:54,890
the pony has denotes a B and C that we have okay all right and then you can

333
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:02,500
have okay all right and then you can search on you know particular case

334
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:02,510


335
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:10,400
certainly six and seven is not there so there's no need to actually you know to

336
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,500
there's no need to actually you know to put six and seven in the picture at all

337
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,480
put six and seven in the picture at all alright so we don't have any six and

338
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,990
alright so we don't have any six and seven so so if you can see that if you

339
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,080
seven so so if you can see that if you analyze this all right this relation is

340
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,970
analyze this all right this relation is actually true it's not the case given to

341
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:31,370
actually true it's not the case given to be exploring the pen defied all right so

342
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:36,050
be exploring the pen defied all right so so again if you restrain yourself on the

343
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,050
so again if you restrain yourself on the ancestral graph alright in this case

344
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,140
ancestral graph alright in this case this beginning of a B and C you can

345
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,850
this beginning of a B and C you can maintain the conditional dependence

346
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,040
maintain the conditional dependence relations from the directed and

347
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:54,279
relations from the directed and undirected

348
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:54,289


349
00:21:54,289 --> 00:22:01,459
lectures will define basically it won't be an amicable distribution if the

350
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:03,440
be an amicable distribution if the independence relations implied by the

351
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,180
independence relations implied by the graph for subsets of the independent

352
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,099
graph for subsets of the independent elections implied by the distribution

353
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:11,269
elections implied by the distribution and we also define a perfect map so

354
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:13,399
and we also define a perfect map so Jason Patric monopoly distribution if I

355
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,729
Jason Patric monopoly distribution if I have J equal to I of P the message here

356
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:18,469
have J equal to I of P the message here is that the directed and undirected

357
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:22,129
is that the directed and undirected graphs are perfect Maps basically four

358
00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:27,579
graphs are perfect Maps basically four different sets of distributions okay so

359
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,799
different sets of distributions okay so in this sense they are powerful but

360
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,589
in this sense they are powerful but basically they're pretty mental of each

361
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:35,690
basically they're pretty mental of each other or I continentally of each other

362
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:41,450
other or I continentally of each other so let me give you an example I think it

363
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,779
so let me give you an example I think it was this was in an early election but we

364
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,729
was this was in an early election but we make an effort to avoid discussion of

365
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:48,919
make an effort to avoid discussion of the details so let's consider this

366
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:52,879
the details so let's consider this undirected graph all right and can you

367
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:54,589
undirected graph all right and can you give me some independent statements on

368
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:58,820
give me some independent statements on this graph simply by looking at this

369
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,370
this graph simply by looking at this operation

370
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:03,380


371
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:09,039
so what it is independent the condition independent said given what they'll be

372
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,919
independent said given what they'll be because every math is blocked by DMV and

373
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,560
because every math is blocked by DMV and similarly there'd be our condition

374
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,110
similarly there'd be our condition dependent given agency so the position

375
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:21,010
dependent given agency so the position that someone may ask is this many basic

376
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:25,740
that someone may ask is this many basic to go that in quotes exactly the same

377
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,880
to go that in quotes exactly the same independence relation says this endeavor

378
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,799
independence relation says this endeavor the answer is you can't all right the

379
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,630
the answer is you can't all right the answer is no and when I demonstrate here

380
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,000
answer is no and when I demonstrate here is two examples you can try as many as

381
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,149
is two examples you can try as many as you want

382
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:47,169
you want design this directed graph so this we

383
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:50,140
design this directed graph so this we can say that a and C are independent

384
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,549
can say that a and C are independent given baby that's nice

385
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:57,029
given baby that's nice you should not okay so the energy

386
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:59,860
you should not okay so the energy independent given B and D which is the

387
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,440
independent given B and D which is the same as thought but let's look at the

388
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,330
same as thought but let's look at the northern relation of actually is implied

389
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,230
northern relation of actually is implied by this graph given a B and D are

390
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,710
by this graph given a B and D are conditionally independent you see that

391
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:17,710
conditionally independent you see that so it is being independent given air is

392
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,710
so it is being independent given air is being the independent knowing right

393
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,970
being the independent knowing right because there is about to be from B to C

394
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,120
because there is about to be from B to C okay

395
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,490
okay so business of work let's look at this

396
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:33,399
so business of work let's look at this graph we satisfy given baby and you see

397
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:38,230
graph we satisfy given baby and you see an independent alright so this is the

398
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,789
an independent alright so this is the same relation as there so let's

399
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:43,450
same relation as there so let's concentrate on this independent relation

400
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,570
concentrate on this independent relation that say but do you think this

401
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:57,370
that say but do you think this independent of B why is that

402
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:57,380


403
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,130
that's obvious isn't it

404
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:02,140


405
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,100
so this is independent of me I mean there's no such a thing being dependent

406
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:14,440
there's no such a thing being dependent of liver okay you can tell other cases

407
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,680
of liver okay you can tell other cases right you can convince yourself that

408
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,160
right you can convince yourself that there are a few graphical models

409
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,180
there are a few graphical models basically have the same independence

410
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,640
basically have the same independence relations and the majority basis

411
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,200
relations and the majority basis basically are coming from the fact of

412
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,840
basically are coming from the fact of this explaining away scenario but we

413
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,120
this explaining away scenario but we have seen earlier in the course so

414
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,430
have seen earlier in the course so basically what is a conclusion if you

415
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,740
basically what is a conclusion if you take the whole subset of probabilistic

416
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,450
take the whole subset of probabilistic graphical models okay this is the direct

417
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,840
graphical models okay this is the direct a graphical models right with their

418
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,520
a graphical models right with their condition independence relations to the

419
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,800
condition independence relations to the undirected graphical models and there is

420
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,690
undirected graphical models and there is a subset of dialectical director that

421
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,940
a subset of dialectical director that they're

422
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,680
they're graphical models but basically say the

423
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,910
graphical models but basically say the same conditional independence relations

424
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:15,270
same conditional independence relations models you get the same way Treehugger

425
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,440
models you get the same way Treehugger alright so there is a relation there

426
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,840
alright so there is a relation there that's why the junction tree algorithm

427
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,110
that's why the junction tree algorithm is successful so the half is a graph

428
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,510
is successful so the half is a graph where if you collapse the matter will

429
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,740
where if you collapse the matter will see needs click together

430
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,770
see needs click together megohm elements what you get is you get

431
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:35,140
megohm elements what you get is you get a tree okay so apart from that there is

432
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,240
a tree okay so apart from that there is a whole subset basically of conditional

433
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,370
a whole subset basically of conditional dependence relations you can get with

434
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,620
dependence relations you can get with the red gloves but you never get with on

435
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:48,880
the red gloves but you never get with on the left so as I discussed about the

436
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,610
the left so as I discussed about the parameterization so the parameterization

437
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:56,080
parameterization so the parameterization we discuss it has to be internship for

438
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,630
we discuss it has to be internship for potentials defined over the clicks so

439
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,570
potentials defined over the clicks so this potential system is finalized with

440
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,540
this potential system is finalized with a set of parameters theta C so this is

441
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,380
a set of parameters theta C so this is potential on click see this potential

442
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,470
potential on click see this potential sculptural basically locally dependence

443
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,060
sculptural basically locally dependence between

444
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,150
between but they're not probabilities okay so

445
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,060
but they're not probabilities okay so you cannot really say maximal working

446
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,400
you cannot really say maximal working alone of this potential

447
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,350
alone of this potential you cannot basically do inference

448
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,080
you cannot basically do inference because you do inference you will need

449
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,370
because you do inference you will need to put the whole Janie distribution with

450
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:33,090
to put the whole Janie distribution with all the potential terms together so the

451
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,610
all the potential terms together so the this is the most famous theorem actually

452
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,710
this is the most famous theorem actually there harmlessly playful theorem that

453
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,350
there harmlessly playful theorem that says that the Joint Distribution of all

454
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,570
says that the Joint Distribution of all this viable swine and undirected graphs

455
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,190
this viable swine and undirected graphs is the product of potentials definable

456
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,370
is the product of potentials definable maximal cliques divided by an

457
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,930
maximal cliques divided by an organization cost of this partition

458
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,810
organization cost of this partition function taken of the parameters defined

459
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,320
function taken of the parameters defined over its click okay this the composition

460
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,040
over its click okay this the composition is not unique and so for example if you

461
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,300
is not unique and so for example if you have potentials here that their

462
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,670
have potentials here that their potentials and you have so carefully

463
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,800
potentials and you have so carefully these potentials which note you can

464
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,500
these potentials which note you can learn them together to power potentials

465
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,760
learn them together to power potentials so this the composition is not unique

466
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,460
so this the composition is not unique as a matter when the algorithms you may

467
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:23,430
as a matter when the algorithms you may want to make this decomposition as any

468
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,410
want to make this decomposition as any way that the thing is going to simplify

469
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,670
way that the thing is going to simplify your type of calculations now the

470
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,650
your type of calculations now the difficult thing here and if I have time

471
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,000
difficult thing here and if I have time we will discuss you today all the way

472
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,340
we will discuss you today all the way from Thursday's completing this

473
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,470
from Thursday's completing this parameters theta and you notice

474
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,060
parameters theta and you notice unfortunately you will not be able to do

475
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,520
unfortunately you will not be able to do influence locally in general you would

476
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,600
influence locally in general you would have to this this term here this

477
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,790
have to this this term here this partition function is that brings

478
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,310
partition function is that brings everything together and is going to

479
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:54,830
everything together and is going to complicate it so here is an example of

480
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,990
complicate it so here is an example of one partition in multiple clicks a clip

481
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:03,840
one partition in multiple clicks a clip 1 2 3 2 3 4 &amp; 3 5 so writers in terms of

482
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,500
1 2 3 2 3 4 &amp; 3 5 so writers in terms of this potential

483
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:07,510


484
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:14,340
I mention a lot of these things are very much related with physics but this

485
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,910
much related with physics but this particular statistical physics so this

486
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,490
particular statistical physics so this distribution the most normal way to do

487
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,460
distribution the most normal way to do this is write it in terms of families is

488
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,380
this is write it in terms of families is affiliated with its peak we really have

489
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,890
affiliated with its peak we really have seen this before so

490
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,550
seen this before so so here basically children potentials is

491
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,580
so here basically children potentials is written to what sport e to the minus C

492
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,980
written to what sport e to the minus C where is an energy defined over that

493
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,870
where is an energy defined over that particular clickin because the product

494
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,900
particular clickin because the product basically you get the gives distribution

495
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,380
basically you get the gives distribution where the energy of the system is the

496
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,840
where the energy of the system is the sum of the energy so for maximal cliques

497
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,910
sum of the energy so for maximal cliques okay so this is the potential defined

498
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:59,790
okay so this is the potential defined over over its belief now this comes with

499
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:05,790
over over its belief now this comes with different names right as we receive in

500
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,060
different names right as we receive in some books they say mister maximum

501
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,900
some books they say mister maximum entropy Tydfil for distribution in

502
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,670
entropy Tydfil for distribution in machine learning they call this energy

503
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,940
machine learning they call this energy models at the end of the den of the day

504
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,390
models at the end of the den of the day you can even think of this as a pig

505
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,390
you can even think of this as a pig right well there is no energy or

506
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,100
right well there is no energy or something like that but you have these

507
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,530
something like that but you have these potentials e to the minus exponential

508
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,570
potentials e to the minus exponential because that way you can see that you

509
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,500
because that way you can see that you will get a positive product that is

510
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,180
will get a positive product that is relative to have the factor piston

511
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,940
relative to have the factor piston distribution right so I think it

512
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,420
distribution right so I think it probably does if the minus energy it

513
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,750
probably does if the minus energy it doesn't have to be motivated by twisting

514
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:49,920
doesn't have to be motivated by twisting all right so this is a parametrization

515
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,960
all right so this is a parametrization that only accounts for pairwise

516
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:53,970


517
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:59,940
potentials all right when we say but this is not maximal cliques right so I

518
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,540
this is not maximal cliques right so I can see here potential want to 1 3 2 3

519
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:08,130
can see here potential want to 1 3 2 3 so as I said you can actually do

520
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,740
so as I said you can actually do anything you want here because this

521
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,010
anything you want here because this factorization is not unique

522
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:23,539
factorization is not unique so she reviews pairwise potentials okay

523
00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:28,930
so she reviews pairwise potentials okay so she the bins are a way of analyzing

524
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,490
so she the bins are a way of analyzing this potentials from their cliques and

525
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,269
this potentials from their cliques and this is what is called a linear model so

526
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:39,289
this is what is called a linear model so it's potential directed as potential to

527
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:42,889
it's potential directed as potential to be a some basis functions defined over

528
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:45,740
be a some basis functions defined over the features YC so these are the

529
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,060
the features YC so these are the variables in the clique product with set

530
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,470
variables in the clique product with set of parameters theta C alright so this is

531
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,620
of parameters theta C alright so this is a noble right in statistics of the main

532
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:10,419
a noble right in statistics of the main potential is expressed here selenium or

533
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:10,429


534
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:17,750
you may have to ask yourself whether this future functions here P okay so and

535
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,360
this future functions here P okay so and sometimes you just fistic aliyou assume

536
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,710
sometimes you just fistic aliyou assume something all right

537
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,100
something all right you know the title for mobiles and for

538
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,409
you know the title for mobiles and for example language models you don't have

539
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:30,710
example language models you don't have to learn this future constants well you

540
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,620
to learn this future constants well you can you know you can envision throwing

541
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,450
can you know you can envision throwing and lots of this function so letting the

542
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,760
and lots of this function so letting the data figure out which ones are needed

543
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,710
data figure out which ones are needed and the second problem would be to

544
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,810
and the second problem would be to calculate those parameters theta C and

545
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,990
calculate those parameters theta C and we will say that's where the concept of

546
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,630
we will say that's where the concept of stochastic optimization will come in in

547
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,110
stochastic optimization will come in in in the various parameters are computed

548
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:59,720
in the various parameters are computed so potential over the maximal clique all

549
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,980
so potential over the maximal clique all right so the potential is to this linear

550
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:08,659
right so the potential is to this linear term here the distribution so this

551
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:10,730
term here the distribution so this distribution is the product of all the

552
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,020
distribution is the product of all the potentials so the

553
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,660
potentials so the information of all of his limbs so I'm

554
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,370
information of all of his limbs so I'm going to have the summation of all of

555
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,680
going to have the summation of all of this it's a function of times theta C

556
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,540
this it's a function of times theta C decline over leads click - the

557
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:28,020
decline over leads click - the normalization factor Z of people ok and

558
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,110
normalization factor Z of people ok and again you see that this animal kills if

559
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,780
again you see that this animal kills if theta is going to be coming in all the

560
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,910
theta is going to be coming in all the time and it's going to be a should they

561
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:39,210
time and it's going to be a should they because it's not like okay this is

562
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,160
because it's not like okay this is proportional to Y we don't need to this

563
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,770
proportional to Y we don't need to this so unfortunately if you're going to

564
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,860
so unfortunately if you're going to estimate these parameters respond that

565
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,010
estimate these parameters respond that those are powerful through this

566
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,710
those are powerful through this normalization term okay so for example

567
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,500
normalization term okay so for example when we try to delete a maximum

568
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,400
when we try to delete a maximum likelihood estimation or map estimation

569
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,240
likelihood estimation or map estimation where you can envision if you like this

570
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,890
where you can envision if you like this can try to maximize this right and if

571
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:08,340
can try to maximize this right and if you do MLA this term is going to be

572
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,649
you do MLA this term is going to be difficult to compute because you will

573
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:14,460
difficult to compute because you will require integration basically on YC or

574
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,440
require integration basically on YC or the product of the potential so that

575
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,940
the product of the potential so that would be very difficult time to operate

576
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,180
would be very difficult time to operate all right so it was an example if this

577
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:30,110
all right so it was an example if this future functions are if so we paralyze

578
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,270
future functions are if so we paralyze market on the field I forgot to mention

579
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,990
market on the field I forgot to mention that the field is basically the

580
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,370
that the field is basically the alternative world that goes for this

581
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,940
alternative world that goes for this undirected graphical models so we only

582
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,540
undirected graphical models so we only think they paralyze potentials and we

583
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,830
think they paralyze potentials and we assume that each of the body which can

584
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:51,210
assume that each of the body which can take K values and so this future

585
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,159
take K values and so this future functions are basically indicator

586
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,010
functions are basically indicator function so in this case this particular

587
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,260
function so in this case this particular indicator function takes the value 1

588
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,440
indicator function takes the value 1 when the variable Y else is day and the

589
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,030
when the variable Y else is day and the value of YT is equal to K ok so and so

590
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,700
value of YT is equal to K ok so and so effectively you can think of this you

591
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,490
effectively you can think of this you know F is a vector of length K squared

592
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,880
know F is a vector of length K squared because you have K times K variables

593
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,650
because you have K times K variables okay so the petition basically can be

594
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,019
okay so the petition basically can be written as a table because if you try to

595
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,089
written as a table because if you try to calculate the potential for values of y

596
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:26,490
calculate the potential for values of y es and YT equals a and Kelly so

597
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,589
es and YT equals a and Kelly so effectively what you need to do is you

598
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:30,630
effectively what you need to do is you can see that this is the exponential of

599
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:38,190
can see that this is the exponential of the JK parameter theta s T okay so in

600
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,380
the JK parameter theta s T okay so in some sense there is a similarity between

601
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,650
some sense there is a similarity between for this discrete model using tables and

602
00:35:45,650 --> 00:36:19,140
for this discrete model using tables and using this function okay so for example

603
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,140
using this function okay so for example based you know can be any indicator

604
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,569
based you know can be any indicator function of a few minutes

605
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:28,289
function of a few minutes these are indexed in the text okay

606
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:30,799
these are indexed in the text okay typically of the corresponding

607
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:34,559
typically of the corresponding parameters all right so this function is

608
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,180
parameters all right so this function is a binary function can take the value 0

609
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,069
a binary function can take the value 0 over 1 so this way you can identify

610
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:42,920
over 1 so this way you can identify certain words so if you have for example

611
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,170
certain words so if you have for example this is for triplet so if you have a

612
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:50,249
this is for triplet so if you have a world I and G or you know or something

613
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,650
world I and G or you know or something similar where the problem is if you try

614
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:56,609
similar where the problem is if you try to do this for a real text right and you

615
00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:00,950
to do this for a real text right and you take you know 26 letters in the alphabet

616
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:05,809
take you know 26 letters in the alphabet so this will result basically to 26:58

617
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:08,009
so this will result basically to 26:58 parameters theta so will be

618
00:37:08,009 --> 00:37:10,499
parameters theta so will be computationally a very difficult thing

619
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:13,289
computationally a very difficult thing to do alright so it's not like you're

620
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:14,970
to do alright so it's not like you're going to populate tables with millions

621
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,799
going to populate tables with millions of parameters and you're going to do

622
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:21,660
of parameters and you're going to do sort of MLE to computer so this will not

623
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,079
sort of MLE to computer so this will not work very well

624
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,819
work very well okay so now I went to the back to and

625
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:35,339
okay so now I went to the back to and slowly to the Ising model and revisited

626
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,589
slowly to the Ising model and revisited basically some of the ideas with this

627
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,930
basically some of the ideas with this person and see how we can train this

628
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:46,710
person and see how we can train this model which the hostak optimization the

629
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,739
model which the hostak optimization the Ising model we're looking on a good in

630
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:53,190
Ising model we're looking on a good in two dimensions or three dimensions we're

631
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,809
two dimensions or three dimensions we're basically trying to mimic the behavior

632
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:59,099
basically trying to mimic the behavior of magnets so these animals of binary

633
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:03,239
of magnets so these animals of binary variables plus minus one you can think

634
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,920
variables plus minus one you can think of this spin up spin down type of things

635
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,839
of this spin up spin down type of things when neighboring spins particularly in

636
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,430
when neighboring spins particularly in the same direction you get what's called

637
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,279
the same direction you get what's called ferromagnets when they try to align in

638
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:16,249
ferromagnets when they try to align in opposite direction you get

639
00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:20,729
opposite direction you get antiferromagnets sometimes you get to be

640
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:22,829
antiferromagnets sometimes you get to be behaving this way how to behave that way

641
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:24,839
behaving this way how to behave that way and then in some sense you have a phase

642
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:28,710
and then in some sense you have a phase transition okay you may think this is a

643
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,529
transition okay you may think this is a toy problem it's a very biblical problem

644
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:35,370
toy problem it's a very biblical problem and some of the references of I posted

645
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,849
and some of the references of I posted actually not surprising they're like

646
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:40,979
actually not surprising they're like from the last five years okay because if

647
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:43,190
from the last five years okay because if you can do this problem properly with

648
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,620
you can do this problem properly with millions of applications in in in many

649
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,749
millions of applications in in in many different areas and of course you must

650
00:38:48,749 --> 00:38:52,279
different areas and of course you must similarity hello okay so the position

651
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:55,049
similarity hello okay so the position from the model so the potential is not

652
00:38:55,049 --> 00:38:58,349
from the model so the potential is not like this so we're looking here at the

653
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:01,259
like this so we're looking here at the pairwise potential obviously each of

654
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:02,880
pairwise potential obviously each of these variables can be spin up or spin

655
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,349
these variables can be spin up or spin down so plus minus one all right so it's

656
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:09,120
down so plus minus one all right so it's on our table each of those values we're

657
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,499
on our table each of those values we're gonna write it as a to W and E minus W

658
00:39:13,499 --> 00:39:15,359
gonna write it as a to W and E minus W who use the same value basically to

659
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,519
who use the same value basically to describe what this probabilities and the

660
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,910
describe what this probabilities and the story is going to be on

661
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,569
story is going to be on - somehow we we have to computer or

662
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:27,250
- somehow we we have to computer or askew you remember the independence of

663
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,039
askew you remember the independence of the energies that we used before right

664
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:34,900
the energies that we used before right what's the local energy here from the

665
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,500
what's the local energy here from the system

666
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,299
system remember you have to learn with the

667
00:39:37,299 --> 00:39:41,140
remember you have to learn with the potentials to be at work for I mean the

668
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:46,059
potentials to be at work for I mean the potential in this cable to the energy

669
00:39:46,059 --> 00:40:07,029
potential in this cable to the energy here okay no energy means high

670
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:12,730
here okay no energy means high probability so so can you tell me from

671
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:15,759
probability so so can you tell me from all of this looking at the stable which

672
00:40:15,759 --> 00:40:17,140
all of this looking at the stable which situation will give you that the low

673
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:21,519
situation will give you that the low energy so that the W is positive and

674
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,609
energy so that the W is positive and determine the Arabs is minus W so gamma

675
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:27,249
determine the Arabs is minus W so gamma is positive which configurations are

676
00:40:27,249 --> 00:40:32,349
is positive which configurations are going to give you low energy if gamma is

677
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:37,970
going to give you low energy if gamma is positive

678
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:37,980


679
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:43,309
remember this is the configuration one plus 1 this is 4 minus 1 this is plus

680
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:45,530
plus 1 this is 4 minus 1 this is plus minus 1 plus minus 1 so which

681
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:49,460
minus 1 plus minus 1 so which configurations will give you will give

682
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,289
configurations will give you will give you the longest tendency of the highest

683
00:40:51,289 --> 00:41:01,960
you the longest tendency of the highest probability if the energy is minus W

684
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:01,970


685
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:09,920
remember means minus a hundred is whatever - a 50 or zero or 10

686
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,589
whatever - a 50 or zero or 10 so which configurations are going to be

687
00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:23,030
so which configurations are going to be over it in both case which means either

688
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,849
over it in both case which means either the left or on speed up or they're both

689
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:29,089
the left or on speed up or they're both down spin down so basically the system

690
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:32,059
down spin down so basically the system will try to give you the same

691
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:33,829
will try to give you the same arrangements of the spins throughout the

692
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:38,359
arrangements of the spins throughout the lattice ok and and of course you get the

693
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:40,870
lattice ok and and of course you get the opposite effect when the W is negative

694
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:46,430
opposite effect when the W is negative okay so in in the trivial sense if you

695
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:50,289
okay so in in the trivial sense if you want if you make WS stay constant okay

696
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:54,700
want if you make WS stay constant okay you can get sort of a simple the most

697
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,829
you can get sort of a simple the most obvious version of 12 of this Ising

698
00:41:57,829 --> 00:41:59,230
obvious version of 12 of this Ising model

699
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:04,839
model alright so we discuss all of this

700
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:08,420
alright so we discuss all of this because I mentioned that the

701
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:13,180
because I mentioned that the normalization constant for this you know

702
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,160
normalization constant for this you know market on the princes is there today

703
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,210
market on the princes is there today so in general to compute a normalization

704
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:22,549
so in general to compute a normalization term living from the Ising model is

705
00:42:22,549 --> 00:42:23,420
term living from the Ising model is np-hard

706
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:26,299
np-hard ok and actually

707
00:42:26,299 --> 00:42:27,620
ok and actually you know I was looking at it this

708
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,900
you know I was looking at it this morning you can look at if you pay a

709
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,150
morning you can look at if you pay a distance I am yes

710
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,969
distance I am yes you know 10 15 years ago that basically

711
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,569
you know 10 15 years ago that basically gives Apple and how difficult is the

712
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:40,910
gives Apple and how difficult is the computer normalization in a simple

713
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:45,140
computer normalization in a simple two-dimensional Ising model okay so now

714
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,870
two-dimensional Ising model okay so now I see one that is five by five you can

715
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,819
I see one that is five by five you can do it by hand 10 by 10 you can do it by

716
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:52,249
do it by hand 10 by 10 you can do it by can try to do it in a million by Amelia

717
00:42:52,249 --> 00:42:54,559
can try to do it in a million by Amelia but okay that's a very difficult

718
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,259
but okay that's a very difficult complicated things there is a relation

719
00:42:57,259 --> 00:42:59,569
complicated things there is a relation between the Ising model and the asian

720
00:42:59,569 --> 00:43:03,439
between the Ising model and the asian graphical models we actually if you may

721
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:05,599
graphical models we actually if you may be for that but somehow some of the

722
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,219
be for that but somehow some of the examples we we use this ideas so if I'd

723
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:12,679
examples we we use this ideas so if I'd taken the Ising model paralyzed

724
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:16,549
taken the Ising model paralyzed potentials alright so I can write this

725
00:43:16,549 --> 00:43:21,109
potentials alright so I can write this as this alright so the line of my

726
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:23,120
as this alright so the line of my distribution is minus the summation of

727
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,199
distribution is minus the summation of this terms remember because we had the

728
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:29,509
this terms remember because we had the original - lab menu I still have the

729
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:31,219
original - lab menu I still have the same thing because this Y value must

730
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:34,729
same thing because this Y value must replace minus 1 okay all right so

731
00:43:34,729 --> 00:43:36,859
replace minus 1 okay all right so basically this is like selling one of

732
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:39,229
basically this is like selling one of the energies on this time somewhere over

733
00:43:39,229 --> 00:43:41,269
the energies on this time somewhere over the pair's and if you want to write this

734
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:42,319
the pair's and if you want to write this in a matrix form

735
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,189
in a matrix form alright you will put on a half so when

736
00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:48,259
alright you will put on a half so when because this is another directed graph

737
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:50,900
because this is another directed graph you don't account the interactions that

738
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,829
you don't account the interactions that say from outside and say twice okay so

739
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:56,479
say from outside and say twice okay so so maybe you can see that this looks

740
00:43:56,479 --> 00:43:59,029
so maybe you can see that this looks like a Gaussian Marco I mean those in

741
00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:00,709
like a Gaussian Marco I mean those in graphical model alright

742
00:44:00,709 --> 00:44:03,349
graphical model alright but obviously you will need something to

743
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,870
but obviously you will need something to mimic the minterm and the way you do

744
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:08,599
mimic the minterm and the way you do this is by introducing an external field

745
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:12,140
this is by introducing an external field in the energy function that looks like

746
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,069
in the energy function that looks like this okay

747
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:18,650
this okay you can think physically if you in this

748
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:21,799
you can think physically if you in this magnet model right you want to control

749
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:23,959
magnet model right you want to control the obvious magnetization of the system

750
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:27,910
the obvious magnetization of the system okay if this is a composition of a

751
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:29,870
okay if this is a composition of a material system and al-ahli

752
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,910
material system and al-ahli you can control maybe the average

753
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:35,650
you can control maybe the average composition you know

754
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,809
composition you know this can be related to an external

755
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:41,039
this can be related to an external magnetic field or something like that so

756
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:43,690
magnetic field or something like that so in the context of what we do is we

757
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:46,870
in the context of what we do is we basically enhance the energy with this

758
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:50,500
basically enhance the energy with this term beta transpose Y and immediately

759
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,779
term beta transpose Y and immediately you can save to plug things together and

760
00:44:52,779 --> 00:44:54,819
you can save to plug things together and you complete the square

761
00:44:54,819 --> 00:45:00,430
you complete the square you basically you can tell us this you

762
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:04,630
you basically you can tell us this you know it's in mobile as a graphical

763
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,640
know it's in mobile as a graphical browser graphical model

764
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,849
browser graphical model all right the relation between variables

765
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:14,920
all right the relation between variables is basically direct so the precision for

766
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,029
is basically direct so the precision for the Gaussian model is basically the

767
00:45:19,029 --> 00:45:47,640
the Gaussian model is basically the strength of these links that you know in

768
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:47,650


769
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:53,890
a Gaussian position actually is very easy because the nomination for Gaussian

770
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:58,329
easy because the nomination for Gaussian is is the determinant of 2 Pi Sigma then

771
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:00,760
is is the determinant of 2 Pi Sigma then you can do this in the dimensions with a

772
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:06,250
you can do this in the dimensions with a cost that goes to they came when I'm

773
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:09,519
cost that goes to they came when I'm constantly in immersive mode the right

774
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:14,589
constantly in immersive mode the right if you have de the pixels and insulin

775
00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:17,740
if you have de the pixels and insulin can be as minus 1 we will have to sound

776
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,450
can be as minus 1 we will have to sound to find an organization over to the

777
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:24,650
to find an organization over to the power

778
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:24,660


779
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:31,270
you know one of those - okay and this is where I mentioned that this is np-hard

780
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:35,900
where I mentioned that this is np-hard okay so those initial to normalize the

781
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,240
okay so those initial to normalize the Ising model not very easy to normalize

782
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,190
Ising model not very easy to normalize very much

783
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:42,350
very much and of course in many ways you will

784
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:43,880
and of course in many ways you will think of the Ising model being trivial

785
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,700
think of the Ising model being trivial but the Gaussian is much more rich model

786
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,520
but the Gaussian is much more rich model but we can see there is a complexity

787
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:56,060
but we can see there is a complexity there in a signal you can generalize

788
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,830
there in a signal you can generalize actually if you have a fully connected

789
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:01,760
actually if you have a fully connected Ising model all right so all the entries

790
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,520
Ising model all right so all the entries in the W no despair potentials but you

791
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,680
in the W no despair potentials but you have all the answers W you get with the

792
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,470
have all the answers W you get with the squirrel have to network and I think

793
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:14,470
squirrel have to network and I think this was one of the many applications of

794
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:17,180
this was one of the many applications of probabilistic graphical models back in

795
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:21,550
probabilistic graphical models back in the seventies or eighties all right and

796
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:23,990
the seventies or eighties all right and the I'm gonna give you only an example

797
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:27,140
the I'm gonna give you only an example of web business so in this little

798
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,990
of web business so in this little networks basically with this you provide

799
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:33,790
networks basically with this you provide the rest of time in images all right and

800
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:51,200
the rest of time in images all right and system system was missing and I said

801
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,150
system system was missing and I said what is his name you know who is that

802
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:56,360
what is his name you know who is that person right because my bank cannot take

803
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,240
person right because my bank cannot take all the pixels and process them so the

804
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,650
all the pixels and process them so the idea here is to give this training

805
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,050
idea here is to give this training images with lots of black pixels missing

806
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:07,700
images with lots of black pixels missing all right and then this social network

807
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,310
all right and then this social network is trying to figure out to what it

808
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:11,840
is trying to figure out to what it corresponds and you can see this of the

809
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,480
corresponds and you can see this of the recovery images in some interactive

810
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,060
recovery images in some interactive kostik optimization so per version of

811
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,240
kostik optimization so per version of this algorithms and we will revisit we

812
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,720
this algorithms and we will revisit we will visit in today or on Thursday this

813
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,849
will visit in today or on Thursday this algorithm okay so

814
00:48:27,849 --> 00:48:27,859


815
00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:34,029
so this is sort of the imputation problem in in this imaging and that's

816
00:48:34,029 --> 00:48:36,519
problem in in this imaging and that's why it's called associative memory is

817
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:38,890
why it's called associative memory is like you know you have memorize things

818
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,900
like you know you have memorize things but you know you want to be able to make

819
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,140
but you know you want to be able to make decisions using incomplete version of

820
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,799
decisions using incomplete version of this images and figure out what they are

821
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:57,130
this images and figure out what they are okay this actually give you a lot of

822
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,489
okay this actually give you a lot of details of this because we will do

823
00:48:59,489 --> 00:49:01,329
details of this because we will do gradient methods to address these

824
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:04,690
gradient methods to address these problems the method that in I indicated

825
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:28,140
problems the method that in I indicated here their information specifically

826
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,150


827
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:53,710
this is plus one then has to be plus one something like that so in some sense

828
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,029
something like that so in some sense this is what this does

829
00:49:55,029 --> 00:49:57,210
this is what this does okay so there is an analytical solution

830
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:00,640
okay so there is an analytical solution to that problem of course this have to

831
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,739
to that problem of course this have to be weighted with the strength of the

832
00:50:02,739 --> 00:50:06,700
be weighted with the strength of the interactions of the pixel s with the

833
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,079
interactions of the pixel s with the other pixel thing okay there is a

834
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:14,410
other pixel thing okay there is a mathematical solution as I said but that

835
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,420
mathematical solution as I said but that we will discuss with the gradient

836
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:21,099
we will discuss with the gradient methods this also goes you know it's

837
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:23,200
methods this also goes you know it's very much related to what's called we

838
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,310
very much related to what's called we can you

839
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:28,210
can you it works as mama sins are basically

840
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:31,690
it works as mama sins are basically extensions of this hostile models where

841
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:35,680
extensions of this hostile models where you simply introduce him and animals in

842
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,900
you simply introduce him and animals in addition to what we saw up to now okay

843
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,920
addition to what we saw up to now okay so I'm going to say much more and

844
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:47,250
so I'm going to say much more and alright so and limit pennies on this

845
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:47,260


846
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:55,240
another name that is very popular in in six and it's that's Bobby Luanne a it's

847
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,340
six and it's that's Bobby Luanne a it's like the Ising model but here you are

848
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,440
like the Ising model but here you are looking for multiple discrete states

849
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,310
looking for multiple discrete states so I increased three discrete states and

850
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:05,290
so I increased three discrete states and the same strength of the bonds basically

851
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:08,740
the same strength of the bonds basically say the table form of these potentials

852
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:12,820
say the table form of these potentials looks like this okay I can turn back if

853
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,730
looks like this okay I can turn back if you ask me I can recognize different

854
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:18,340
you ask me I can recognize different problems that I came across using the

855
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,570
problems that I came across using the first model when I was a graduate

856
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:21,850
first model when I was a graduate student so this is a very important

857
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:27,450
student so this is a very important model in multiple areas okay so I'm

858
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,980
model in multiple areas okay so I'm certain if you sell some good parts

859
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:32,020
certain if you sell some good parts model you will come with a million

860
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,720
model you will come with a million basically hits okay because there's a

861
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:39,550
basically hits okay because there's a lots of crazy ones so to me Sam

862
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:39,560


863
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:44,530
so an application of the hosting of the Pat's model basically and I think you

864
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:47,680
Pat's model basically and I think you guys worked on a homework on this kind

865
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:55,300
guys worked on a homework on this kind of beyond the shakiest strength all

866
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,700
of beyond the shakiest strength all right and trying to find this very

867
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,440
right and trying to find this very mountain estimate or the lowest energy

868
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,720
mountain estimate or the lowest energy of the system and you notice when J is

869
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,840
of the system and you notice when J is very big if you get clusters but they're

870
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:10,030
very big if you get clusters but they're spin up when J is very low you have very

871
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:13,570
spin up when J is very low you have very small clusters actually if you want to

872
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,740
small clusters actually if you want to you know

873
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,840
you know now remember one of the main application

874
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,850
now remember one of the main application supports models if you want to get

875
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:21,790
supports models if you want to get samples of crystal micro structures this

876
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:22,660
samples of crystal micro structures this is how you do it

877
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:28,020
is how you do it alright so those things can basically in

878
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:32,160
alright so those things can basically in nice particles but you can figure out

879
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,840
nice particles but you can figure out how you say here's one claim there's

880
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,820
how you say here's one claim there's another grain and another grain stuff

881
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:39,600
another grain and another grain stuff this is something that can mimic a

882
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,510
this is something that can mimic a nucleation processing and will give you

883
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:44,880
nucleation processing and will give you if you're going to get it again if we

884
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,660
if you're going to get it again if we give you definitions of a pretty crystal

885
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:53,130
give you definitions of a pretty crystal microstructure okay some point between

886
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:56,580
microstructure okay some point between for jelly you have a phase transition

887
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,610
for jelly you have a phase transition right and this is a very important area

888
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:03,740
right and this is a very important area of research trying to compute actually

889
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,160
of research trying to compute actually when the phase transition takes place

890
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,040
when the phase transition takes place not an easy problem maybe some colors

891
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,630
not an easy problem maybe some colors because this supports more the lights

892
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:14,550
because this supports more the lights were there they density of the color

893
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,170
were there they density of the color stays what state you are so you don't

894
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:19,500
stays what state you are so you don't just black and white but different

895
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,770
just black and white but different colors I think if you click this little

896
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,710
colors I think if you click this little library from Kevin left this to looks

897
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:28,140
library from Kevin left this to looks you will see what's the corresponding K

898
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:44,150
you will see what's the corresponding K for this discussing some sort of

899
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:51,810
for this discussing some sort of complexity of this model so here the

900
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:55,980
complexity of this model so here the actual pixel values is this actually

901
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:56,790
actual pixel values is this actually what I have in here

902
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:02,460
what I have in here all right this particles okay and they

903
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:06,020
all right this particles okay and they are defined about a grid so a mid way to

904
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:09,600
are defined about a grid so a mid way to more than just Y variables is an

905
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,950
more than just Y variables is an underactive module okay but I should

906
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,070
underactive module okay but I should observe variations of this nodes and a

907
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:18,480
observe variations of this nodes and a very good way to describe the

908
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,170
very good way to describe the subservience is to redirect it model so

909
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:23,880
subservience is to redirect it model so really what you have is you have a

910
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,090
really what you have is you have a mixture and on the Left model to

911
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:29,850
mixture and on the Left model to describe basically the correlations on a

912
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,520
describe basically the correlations on a grid of the Y variables and then to

913
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,050
grid of the Y variables and then to describe the observations you have a

914
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:35,980
describe the observations you have a direct okay

915
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,560
direct okay so if you plan to hide the giant

916
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,560
so if you plan to hide the giant revisionist admission basically and

917
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,990
revisionist admission basically and already have seen this you're going to

918
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:47,650
already have seen this you're going to capture these dependencies between the

919
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:53,589
capture these dependencies between the variables by factorizing this piston

920
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:56,349
variables by factorizing this piston vesicle distribution of Y as a market

921
00:54:56,349 --> 00:54:57,280
vesicle distribution of Y as a market I'll go through it

922
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,700
I'll go through it okay this had potential trouble exits

923
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,589
okay this had potential trouble exits and then of course we are going to hear

924
00:55:02,589 --> 00:55:04,570
and then of course we are going to hear these observations but I've defined

925
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:19,200
these observations but I've defined through a directive okay so very much to

926
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,700
through a directive okay so very much to emphasize that this is sort of an

927
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,500
emphasize that this is sort of an interesting new type of a graph because

928
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,540
interesting new type of a graph because obviously you're not going to capture

929
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,210
obviously you're not going to capture the correlations in Y with a directed

930
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:29,740
the correlations in Y with a directed graph because it makes no sense in the

931
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,570
graph because it makes no sense in the limits right so you're going to capture

932
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:34,630
limits right so you're going to capture them with an undirected graph but this

933
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:40,510
them with an undirected graph but this really you know it is directed model as

934
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:43,359
really you know it is directed model as you see here Y is the parent of white is

935
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,240
you see here Y is the parent of white is the parent of X so this is the

936
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,820
the parent of X so this is the probability of observing XP assuming

937
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,859
probability of observing XP assuming that the true state of the picture

938
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:56,710
that the true state of the picture escaped if you actually want to avoid

939
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,510
escaped if you actually want to avoid complex this you know what you can do is

940
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:02,020
complex this you know what you can do is you can take this down here and lamp it

941
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:06,400
you can take this down here and lamp it is try this connect potentials and then

942
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,870
is try this connect potentials and then actually work with an undirected graph

943
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:10,660
actually work with an undirected graph and never bother with and remember we

944
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:11,829
and never bother with and remember we were doing this when we have this

945
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:14,260
were doing this when we have this evidence potentials we will lumping them

946
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:17,650
evidence potentials we will lumping them on these terms all right so we can

947
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:19,900
on these terms all right so we can watching this to think and so you avoid

948
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,540
watching this to think and so you avoid having to say that you have an

949
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:25,990
having to say that you have an undirected graph and then you know a

950
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:31,770
undirected graph and then you know a direct proportion of

951
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:31,780


952
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:38,370
all right so this graph actually in the literature when you have left a mixture

953
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:39,840
literature when you have left a mixture of on the left and the left is called

954
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,870
of on the left and the left is called the Chandra I think somewhere I may have

955
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:47,580
the Chandra I think somewhere I may have mentioned this in passing in in an

956
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,400
mentioned this in passing in in an earlier lecture

957
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:54,390
earlier lecture demand is really the hidden Markov model

958
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:57,330
demand is really the hidden Markov model okay and it's such a problem as you

959
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,820
okay and it's such a problem as you observed markup on the field okay

960
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,350
observed markup on the field okay it's faster you observe because you

961
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:02,640
it's faster you observe because you don't know the rise but you know the

962
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:09,240
don't know the rise but you know the extras all right so an influence is is a

963
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,610
extras all right so an influence is is a difficult problem so we need to discuss

964
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:14,130
difficult problem so we need to discuss on how to do this okay

965
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:20,880
on how to do this okay this mention this right and maybe

966
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,610
this mention this right and maybe there's an example of two in the slides

967
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:28,500
there's an example of two in the slides we take this model and your objective is

968
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,600
we take this model and your objective is the use of the integration constant so

969
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,980
the use of the integration constant so you know you give an X and you try to

970
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:36,090
you know you give an X and you try to compute Y so this first layer it's in

971
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:40,010
compute Y so this first layer it's in that soil is basically this all right

972
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,900
that soil is basically this all right this is a markup random field it's very

973
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:48,990
this is a markup random field it's very popular on supervised problem is in an

974
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:51,420
popular on supervised problem is in an unsupervised context this can work

975
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,400
unsupervised context this can work completely because for example you can

976
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,220
completely because for example you can think this emphasis must nurses you pass

977
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,290
think this emphasis must nurses you pass from one picture to another but there

978
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:01,380
from one picture to another but there are 15 images you can have discontinuity

979
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:06,180
are 15 images you can have discontinuity somewhere from black to delight 70 right

980
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:10,230
somewhere from black to delight 70 right so in an unsupervised problem this file

981
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,370
so in an unsupervised problem this file will not work

982
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:16,080
will not work all right so it's okay to use it here or

983
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,270
all right so it's okay to use it here or the supervised problem but it doesn't

984
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:26,859
the supervised problem but it doesn't work for supervised problems

985
00:58:26,859 --> 00:58:26,869


986
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:36,849
these so let me just finish on this with discussing about this Gaussian mark of

987
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:39,290
discussing about this Gaussian mark of didn't specifically written intentional

988
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:42,319
didn't specifically written intentional from precision metrics is known for

989
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:47,300
from precision metrics is known for volumes Memphis's so again I have paper

990
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,630
volumes Memphis's so again I have paper pencils here and the sentence

991
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:54,200
pencils here and the sentence pretentious if you like and you can

992
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,390
pretentious if you like and you can parameterize them like this or like that

993
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:59,180
parameterize them like this or like that so immediately you can see if you

994
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,970
so immediately you can see if you privatization is given like this you

995
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:05,599
privatization is given like this you will get a decision basically but this

996
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,829
will get a decision basically but this Gaussian is going to be on an

997
00:59:06,829 --> 00:59:08,599
Gaussian is going to be on an information form because it's with in

998
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:10,760
information form because it's with in terms of Precision's and this why I

999
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:18,940
terms of Precision's and this why I delete all of them to mean all right and

1000
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:18,950


1001
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:27,800
this models were written in terms of precision matrices and particularly

1002
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,839
precision matrices and particularly because this precision met reserves past

1003
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:33,230
because this precision met reserves past we have sparse precision matrices versus

1004
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:38,300
we have sparse precision matrices versus spots the various matrices can remember

1005
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:42,230
spots the various matrices can remember way that we used in this course a

1006
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:45,950
way that we used in this course a Gaussian representation of a random

1007
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,859
Gaussian representation of a random field when we had is passed to the

1008
00:59:48,859 --> 00:59:51,260
field when we had is passed to the audience methods and we did some where

1009
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:53,870
audience methods and we did some where it should ask you the composition and I

1010
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:57,859
it should ask you the composition and I believe he did to see a formal like

1011
00:59:57,859 --> 01:00:02,990
believe he did to see a formal like maybe homework one or two

1012
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:03,000


1013
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:09,620
we went to some kind of you should to give you a homework corner on the

1014
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:14,390
give you a homework corner on the Gaussian random field it seems I know

1015
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:20,440
Gaussian random field it seems I know for sure right but what's happening is

1016
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,270
for sure right but what's happening is metrics not the precision metrics and

1017
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:25,940
metrics not the precision metrics and especially trans metrics is not the same

1018
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:29,710
especially trans metrics is not the same as the space precision metrics okay

1019
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:34,190
as the space precision metrics okay right so this this measurement around

1020
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:36,830
right so this this measurement around the fields need to Espace precision

1021
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:40,220
the fields need to Espace precision metrics okay the numbers we worked every

1022
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,050
metrics okay the numbers we worked every into the course they were leading to

1023
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:48,920
into the course they were leading to sparse covariance matrix again you may

1024
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,390
sparse covariance matrix again you may want to look on on on the notes so

1025
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:57,170
want to look on on on the notes so obviously you don't even know the

1026
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:59,950
obviously you don't even know the specialty of this lambda so here we use

1027
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:01,910
specialty of this lambda so here we use pairwise for pencils

1028
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:07,970
pairwise for pencils so in essence in essence here if this

1029
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:10,550
so in essence in essence here if this term is data or not it implements if

1030
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,410
term is data or not it implements if there is link between two notes or not

1031
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,990
there is link between two notes or not so in essence learning the values of

1032
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:17,180
so in essence learning the values of lambda is the same problem as learning a

1033
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:21,380
lambda is the same problem as learning a structure of the graphical model okay so

1034
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,660
structure of the graphical model okay so you can pass this as an optimization

1035
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,880
you can pass this as an optimization problem for you learn the structure of

1036
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:34,370
problem for you learn the structure of the problem on the clock right

1037
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:34,380


1038
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:43,190
so I'm going to give you an extension we discussed on this you know you know

1039
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:45,410
discussed on this you know you know Pat's model where the microphone that

1040
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:50,660
Pat's model where the microphone that feels for y all right and and and then

1041
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:53,120
feels for y all right and and and then we had an observation longer but can do

1042
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,060
we had an observation longer but can do anything basically can be a Gaussian or

1043
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:57,440
anything basically can be a Gaussian or something like that so I mean I'm going

1044
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,300
something like that so I mean I'm going to give you a picture and I want you to

1045
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:03,020
to give you a picture and I want you to look at this picture and they'll be so

1046
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:08,270
look at this picture and they'll be so this is all right and things are

1047
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:09,020
this is all right and things are basically

1048
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,840
basically latane spaced so I want you to tell me

1049
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:14,420
latane spaced so I want you to tell me what exactly you see when it comes to

1050
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:16,310
what exactly you see when it comes to the context of the links on this on the

1051
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:24,050
the context of the links on this on the same as the change in time

1052
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:28,480
same as the change in time okay so look let's say at a given time

1053
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:40,930
okay so look let's say at a given time is the past

1054
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:40,940


1055
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:55,960
so we are looking here it depends on who - view but also depends on 2-3 right

1056
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:55,970


1057
01:02:55,970 --> 01:03:04,780
looks like this alright the permeability of YT specifically given YT minus 1 YT

1058
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:08,620
of YT specifically given YT minus 1 YT minus 2 and so this mattress is that you

1059
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:12,250
minus 2 and so this mattress is that you see here define the sparsity of the

1060
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:19,750
see here define the sparsity of the connections in time okay now now if you

1061
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:22,780
connections in time okay now now if you notice I shall and again this is so

1062
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:24,550
notice I shall and again this is so forth in one day but you can clean of

1063
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,490
forth in one day but you can clean of this body was being on a good the

1064
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:29,830
this body was being on a good the dependence at the given time between the

1065
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:31,750
dependence at the given time between the Y variables what do you think how do you

1066
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:34,600
Y variables what do you think how do you think they're being done if this was and

1067
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,940
think they're being done if this was and if the name of the training video right

1068
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,370
if the name of the training video right and this were instances of the videos of

1069
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:42,070
and this were instances of the videos of different times so the pixels are the

1070
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:52,210
different times so the pixels are the given time the coordinator obviously in

1071
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:58,660
given time the coordinator obviously in time you can see all right how's it

1072
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,040
time you can see all right how's it going to protonate the pixels to the

1073
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:14,140
going to protonate the pixels to the given time okay the sparsity the

1074
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:15,910
given time okay the sparsity the evolution of wash in time

1075
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:22,540
evolution of wash in time okay this Sigma is it depend how you do

1076
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:23,830
okay this Sigma is it depend how you do this around okay

1077
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:27,700
this around okay they're going to define the oscillations

1078
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:30,790
they're going to define the oscillations at the given time inspect okay

1079
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:33,910
at the given time inspect okay so velocity in the dynamics but very

1080
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:36,280
so velocity in the dynamics but very sparsely basically in capturing the

1081
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:40,360
sparsely basically in capturing the correlations in

1082
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:45,210
correlations in for a given time alright so there is

1083
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:47,740
for a given time alright so there is this dynamic probabilistic graphical

1084
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,540
this dynamic probabilistic graphical models actions very how the area of

1085
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,970
models actions very how the area of research and the disorganization book if

1086
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:55,210
research and the disorganization book if anyone is interested to look it's a you

1087
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:58,000
anyone is interested to look it's a you know it's in Palace but I have a

1088
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,420
know it's in Palace but I have a complicated you know for review so if

1089
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:03,190
complicated you know for review so if anybody's interested you can let me know

1090
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:07,150
anybody's interested you can let me know to make seven hundred pages of very new

1091
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:08,740
to make seven hundred pages of very new algorithms for doing this type of

1092
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:14,350
algorithms for doing this type of problems but don't need this okay and

1093
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:17,920
problems but don't need this okay and I'd have to go now to slide 65 so we can

1094
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:23,190
I'd have to go now to slide 65 so we can do maybe some of the training all right

1095
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:28,370
do maybe some of the training all right all right

1096
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:28,380


1097
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:38,660
so let's go back to this at least we can start to discuss you this so we write

1098
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:42,650
start to discuss you this so we write this probability of y given theta if you

1099
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:45,109
this probability of y given theta if you remember in village potentials is it to

1100
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:47,420
remember in village potentials is it to the paper burns for some future

1101
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:49,430
the paper burns for some future functions to the point of where the

1102
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:52,069
functions to the point of where the clickstream so the type of distillations

1103
01:05:52,069 --> 01:06:06,049
clickstream so the type of distillations with maximum likelihood estimation and I

1104
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:08,870
with maximum likelihood estimation and I think once you know how to Emily to do

1105
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:11,390
think once you know how to Emily to do basically a map estimation is nothing

1106
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:13,849
basically a map estimation is nothing but to put the power out there and do

1107
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:23,059
but to put the power out there and do the same sort of calculation okay so n

1108
01:06:23,059 --> 01:06:25,999
the same sort of calculation okay so n data points so this not my observations

1109
01:06:25,999 --> 01:06:33,410
data points so this not my observations weii okay and i'm i put this powerful

1110
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:35,479
weii okay and i'm i put this powerful man over in there because it's going to

1111
01:06:35,479 --> 01:06:41,559
man over in there because it's going to simplify the calculations i want to do

1112
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:41,569


1113
01:06:41,569 --> 01:06:47,509
looks like to show this against alright so we're gonna take the folks you're

1114
01:06:47,509 --> 01:06:50,180
so we're gonna take the folks you're gonna give a list notation function here

1115
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:53,749
gonna give a list notation function here all right and then the exponential will

1116
01:06:53,749 --> 01:06:55,249
all right and then the exponential will disappear if you can get the summation

1117
01:06:55,249 --> 01:06:57,559
disappear if you can get the summation of this and then summation over all the

1118
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:03,650
of this and then summation over all the data point right the formulas equation

1119
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:07,279
data point right the formulas equation the way it is a very general it appears

1120
01:07:07,279 --> 01:07:09,950
the way it is a very general it appears in intimate settings in in machine

1121
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:12,769
in intimate settings in in machine learning but here the difficult thing is

1122
01:07:12,769 --> 01:07:15,380
learning but here the difficult thing is you have there's no parameters and you

1123
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:17,930
you have there's no parameters and you can envision language for your various

1124
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:20,180
can envision language for your various parameters locally but unfortunately

1125
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:22,309
parameters locally but unfortunately this time it's basically messes you are

1126
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:24,019
this time it's basically messes you are because it released all of the

1127
01:07:24,019 --> 01:07:28,400
because it released all of the parameters since this time to complete

1128
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,710
parameters since this time to complete this partition functions a

1129
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:33,150
this partition functions a you have to serve as we would say an

1130
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:35,580
you have to serve as we would say an infinite problem you have to compute we

1131
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:37,050
infinite problem you have to compute we have to link basically everything

1132
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:39,599
have to link basically everything together okay so this is not good

1133
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,109
together okay so this is not good all right so we need to find some way to

1134
01:07:43,109 --> 01:07:45,359
all right so we need to find some way to handle this problem okay so let's see

1135
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:49,740
handle this problem okay so let's see what is going to lead into this

1136
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:52,320
what is going to lead into this distribution form it looks like an

1137
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,640
distribution form it looks like an exponential function type of

1138
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,060
exponential function type of distribution so if we haven't proved it

1139
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:01,530
distribution so if we haven't proved it on this semester it's in the notes from

1140
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:03,660
on this semester it's in the notes from the Christmas semester so you can look

1141
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:05,790
the Christmas semester so you can look at it basically the likelihood is a

1142
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:08,010
at it basically the likelihood is a convex function of the parameters so it

1143
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:11,490
convex function of the parameters so it has a unique maximum so that's good news

1144
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:14,010
has a unique maximum so that's good news so this is a solution if we want to do

1145
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:17,280
so this is a solution if we want to do an MLA I mean this is of concern

1146
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,440
an MLA I mean this is of concern obviously because if you have some

1147
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,930
obviously because if you have some partition functions yes what happens

1148
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:23,970
partition functions yes what happens right there's no I don't think that it

1149
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:26,809
right there's no I don't think that it will give you a convex function but

1150
01:08:26,809 --> 01:08:29,039
will give you a convex function but because of this exponential poly

1151
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:38,390
because of this exponential poly distributions you get a convex function

1152
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:38,400


1153
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:52,800
on the parameters the potentional click on click see so let's again when you

1154
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:58,769
on click see so let's again when you take those who aspire to stay the same

1155
01:08:58,769 --> 01:08:58,779


1156
01:08:58,779 --> 01:09:06,510
you get the person functions plain to see see right I think's wrong I okay

1157
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:09,390
see see right I think's wrong I okay alright so this is what you get and then

1158
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:12,749
alright so this is what you get and then from the second term human hand

1159
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:14,670
from the second term human hand basically 2/3 relevance with respect to

1160
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:31,490
basically 2/3 relevance with respect to fit the story of the of Z okay right so

1161
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:42,300
fit the story of the of Z okay right so if you can exercise you can function

1162
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,519
if you can exercise you can function with respect to the promise of click see

1163
01:09:44,519 --> 01:09:47,640
with respect to the promise of click see it is nothing else but the expectation

1164
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,579
it is nothing else but the expectation of the person function space see with

1165
01:09:50,579 --> 01:09:52,349
of the person function space see with respect to the underlying probability of

1166
01:09:52,349 --> 01:09:55,650
respect to the underlying probability of P of Y this is no approximation or

1167
01:09:55,650 --> 01:10:03,210
P of Y this is no approximation or anything you know if you think you know

1168
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:05,010
anything you know if you think you know the distribution being the path of this

1169
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:07,470
the distribution being the path of this potential to have nerves so you get

1170
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:10,050
potential to have nerves so you get summation which of the stems and all of

1171
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:12,350
summation which of the stems and all of these things will actually give you the

1172
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:15,330
these things will actually give you the parameters theta C so fact in the end of

1173
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:18,540
parameters theta C so fact in the end of the day it is the expectation of the

1174
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:22,250
the day it is the expectation of the future function P see remember is this

1175
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,840
future function P see remember is this function PC that's affiliated with it as

1176
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:30,060
function PC that's affiliated with it as T all right so you need expectation with

1177
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,760
T all right so you need expectation with respect to the underlying distribution

1178
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,170
respect to the underlying distribution show you know the scale there's no

1179
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:37,710
show you know the scale there's no evidence right dispose why i given theta

1180
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:42,300
evidence right dispose why i given theta and it's a beautiful calculation right

1181
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:45,510
and it's a beautiful calculation right you have to you have to find this

1182
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:47,940
you have to you have to find this expectation and to make it worse you

1183
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:52,080
expectation and to make it worse you have to find this expectation it's step

1184
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,110
have to find this expectation it's step in the gradient descent on good so it's

1185
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:56,520
in the gradient descent on good so it's not like they're gonna be advanced and

1186
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,070
not like they're gonna be advanced and you have done because this involves the

1187
01:10:59,070 --> 01:11:00,930
you have done because this involves the parameters theta and that's what we're

1188
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,190
parameters theta and that's what we're interested concrete so you're going to

1189
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:07,380
interested concrete so you're going to have to do iterations for that okay so

1190
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:08,520
have to do iterations for that okay so let's see something extremely

1191
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,640
let's see something extremely interesting that comes out of this okay

1192
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,240
interesting that comes out of this okay so if you passed me that this is the

1193
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,950
so if you passed me that this is the expectation of the treacherous functions

1194
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:19,440
expectation of the treacherous functions we see with a step to the flow

1195
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,280
we see with a step to the flow distribution P of Y right surviving this

1196
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,860
distribution P of Y right surviving this anotation of expectation and the first

1197
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:34,200
anotation of expectation and the first term all right okay hopefully I don't

1198
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,820
term all right okay hopefully I don't think I have missed it one of rank you

1199
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:39,900
think I have missed it one of rank you so I don't know if they won over them

1200
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:42,060
so I don't know if they won over them disappeared there okay and this is

1201
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,560
disappeared there okay and this is outside the parentheses or you guys

1202
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:47,430
outside the parentheses or you guys second for me so this is one over N

1203
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:49,890
second for me so this is one over N times the summation of the future

1204
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:52,380
times the summation of the future functions PC compute the fixed rate the

1205
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:55,980
functions PC compute the fixed rate the for y I so this is what you get from the

1206
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,170
for y I so this is what you get from the first step so look at this and tell me

1207
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:02,810
first step so look at this and tell me in a more compact notation what is that

1208
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:02,820


1209
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:07,830
so many of the end times so you have a data set endpoints and you

1210
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:12,690
so you have a data set endpoints and you compute this crucial function C of all

1211
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:15,840
compute this crucial function C of all the data ports so what is that it is an

1212
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,260
the data ports so what is that it is an expectation of this chain right with

1213
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:28,620
expectation of this chain right with respect investment web distribution

1214
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:28,630


1215
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:36,980
nope

1216
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:36,990


1217
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:42,980
our samples they'll kill her from this distribution

1218
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:46,350
they'll kill her from this distribution so when I ran the samples the

1219
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:48,210
so when I ran the samples the approximation of distribution having a

1220
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:51,830
approximation of distribution having a corner distribution with other functions

1221
01:12:51,830 --> 01:13:21,439
corner distribution with other functions it's not the camera type thing

1222
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:21,449


1223
01:13:21,449 --> 01:13:50,099
you know expectation with respect to the empirical distribution okay so basically

1224
01:13:50,099 --> 01:13:52,469
empirical distribution okay so basically the dissonant with respect to the

1225
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:55,109
the dissonant with respect to the parameters to the say is the expectation

1226
01:13:55,109 --> 01:13:56,879
parameters to the say is the expectation of this XI with respect to the empirical

1227
01:13:56,879 --> 01:13:59,189
of this XI with respect to the empirical distribution - the expectation of

1228
01:13:59,189 --> 01:14:01,049
distribution - the expectation of receiver respect to the exact

1229
01:14:01,049 --> 01:14:04,319
receiver respect to the exact distribution so basically if you set

1230
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:11,939
distribution so basically if you set this you say in this case you set this

1231
01:14:11,939 --> 01:14:14,159
this you say in this case you set this equal to zero and basically we have a

1232
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:16,259
equal to zero and basically we have a problem that we were discussing in the

1233
01:14:16,259 --> 01:14:18,359
problem that we were discussing in the last three or four lectures and that

1234
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:22,409
last three or four lectures and that problem is not it's made no marching you

1235
01:14:22,409 --> 01:14:26,909
problem is not it's made no marching you see that so expectations of each

1236
01:14:26,909 --> 01:14:31,229
see that so expectations of each respective functions for each case needs

1237
01:14:31,229 --> 01:14:32,009
respective functions for each case needs too much

1238
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:34,079
too much that was funny expectations under the

1239
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:38,309
that was funny expectations under the empirical distribution some please away

1240
01:14:38,309 --> 01:14:42,299
empirical distribution some please away to implement actually rest okay so

1241
01:14:42,299 --> 01:14:44,879
to implement actually rest okay so actively you have to set this equal to

1242
01:14:44,879 --> 01:14:48,049
actively you have to set this equal to this moment

1243
01:14:48,049 --> 01:14:51,269
this moment defined for the under the empirical

1244
01:14:51,269 --> 01:14:59,610
defined for the under the empirical distribution okay

1245
01:14:59,610 --> 01:14:59,620


1246
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:48,990
you can say that we call the maze that actually we so it's not going to find

1247
01:15:48,990 --> 01:16:07,210
actually we so it's not going to find the pinnacle distribution of okay okay

1248
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:21,150
the pinnacle distribution of okay okay you will need to integrate gates Bibles

1249
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:21,160


1250
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:25,990
looks very similar conceptually and automatically like computing the

1251
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:27,970
automatically like computing the partition function will be integrated in

1252
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:33,220
partition function will be integrated in Y so effectively this terms that you get

1253
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:35,530
Y so effectively this terms that you get the look like partition functions

1254
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:38,260
the look like partition functions completed not arbitrary where they are

1255
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:42,160
completed not arbitrary where they are integrating over Y takes an integrating

1256
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,890
integrating over Y takes an integrating knowledge but they are still partition

1257
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:46,780
knowledge but they are still partition functions and I'm going to give you the

1258
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:48,850
functions and I'm going to give you the answer and then we'll come back to it at

1259
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:53,040
answer and then we'll come back to it at the end of the day so the answer comes

1260
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:53,050


1261
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:59,410
basically that the building of the state of the parameters theta C is there is a

1262
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:01,070
of the parameters theta C is there is a summation in the hidden value

1263
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:03,500
summation in the hidden value integrate those out and basically is the

1264
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:06,050
integrate those out and basically is the difference of two expectations one of

1265
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:11,000
difference of two expectations one of them is the distribution of expectation

1266
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,340
them is the distribution of expectation a beta distribution of Y and the other

1267
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:16,790
a beta distribution of Y and the other one is actually the actual moment so

1268
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:20,870
one is actually the actual moment so this moment marching here with its

1269
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:23,630
this moment marching here with its integrated out okay in one of the

1270
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:28,910
integrated out okay in one of the moments Y is basically integrated out in

1271
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:32,380
moments Y is basically integrated out in the other a moment Y is fixed

1272
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:38,020
the other a moment Y is fixed okay Y space and this has a magical

1273
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:44,290
okay Y space and this has a magical total firm implementations based on

1274
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:46,610
total firm implementations based on expectation maximization actually what

1275
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:48,650
expectation maximization actually what is great with the name generalized

1276
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:52,070
is great with the name generalized expectation maximization so we don't

1277
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:55,160
expectation maximization so we don't have to waste some on Thursday and then

1278
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,320
have to waste some on Thursday and then we will give the stability and

1279
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,910
we will give the stability and dissentient of approximation for this

1280
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:01,640
dissentient of approximation for this type of problems
