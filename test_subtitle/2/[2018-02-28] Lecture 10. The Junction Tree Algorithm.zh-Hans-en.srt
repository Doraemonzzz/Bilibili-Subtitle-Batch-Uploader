1
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,900
在没有麦克风的介绍中，所以我们要开始
in the introduction without the microphone so we're gonna start going

2
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:47,910
在没有麦克风的介绍中，所以我们要开始
microphone so we're gonna start going back to the liquor obligation as an

3
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,370
回到白酒义务为例，基本上看一下
microphone so we're gonna start going back to the liquor obligation as an

4
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,080
回到白酒义务为例，基本上看一下
back to the liquor obligation as an example basically to see how the

5
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,090
回到白酒义务为例，基本上看一下
example basically to see how the equations look like for an undirected

6
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,410
方程看起来像是无向图，特别是对于摄影
example basically to see how the equations look like for an undirected

7
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,330
方程看起来像是无向图，特别是对于摄影
equations look like for an undirected graph particularly for photography

8
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:02,340
方程看起来像是无向图，特别是对于摄影
graph particularly for photography okay so we're going to see how to delete

9
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,990
好吧，我们将要看看如何删除动物F的传播算法循环
graph particularly for photography okay so we're going to see how to delete

10
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,640
好吧，我们将要看看如何删除动物F的传播算法循环
okay so we're going to see how to delete propagation algorithm loops for animal F

11
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:10,650
好吧，我们将要看看如何删除动物F的传播算法循环
propagation algorithm loops for animal F that has these cell potentials the way

12
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,160
就像您过去看到的那样具有这些电池的潜能，然后
propagation algorithm loops for animal F that has these cell potentials the way

13
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,230
就像您过去看到的那样具有这些电池的潜能，然后
that has these cell potentials the way you have seen in the past and then it

14
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,240
就像您过去看到的那样具有这些电池的潜能，然后
you have seen in the past and then it has this pair of potentials with receipt

15
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,570
在这里有收据这对电位，所以我们是节点数
you have seen in the past and then it has this pair of potentials with receipt

16
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,120
在这里有收据这对电位，所以我们是节点数
has this pair of potentials with receipt here okay so we are the number of nodes

17
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,130
在这里有收据这对电位，所以我们是节点数
here okay so we are the number of nodes okay

18
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,120
好吧，让我们在图中的边缘，所以这个术语
here okay so we are the number of nodes okay

19
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,910
好吧，让我们在图中的边缘，所以这个术语
okay SOT our edges in the graph so this term

20
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:25,920
好吧，让我们在图中的边缘，所以这个术语
SOT our edges in the graph so this term vs potential square potentials and Z is

21
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,180
与电位平方电位和Z是归一化因子没关系
SOT our edges in the graph so this term vs potential square potentials and Z is

22
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,480
与电位平方电位和Z是归一化因子没关系
vs potential square potentials and Z is the normalization factor all right so

23
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:32,490
与电位平方电位和Z是归一化因子没关系
the normalization factor all right so the the presentation it looks like a

24
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,710
该演示文稿看起来有点不同，但是您知道是否
the normalization factor all right so the the presentation it looks like a

25
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,150
该演示文稿看起来有点不同，但是您知道是否
the the presentation it looks like a slightly different but you know if you

26
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
该演示文稿看起来有点不同，但是您知道是否
slightly different but you know if you got the idea of message passing

27
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,670
有了有效传递消息的想法，它们是一样的东西
slightly different but you know if you got the idea of message passing

28
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,810
有了有效传递消息的想法，它们是一样的东西
got the idea of message passing effectively they are the same things

29
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:41,820
有了有效传递消息的想法，它们是一样的东西
effectively they are the same things okay so what we're gonna do is we are

30
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,350
好吧，我们要做的是基本上假设一个将军
effectively they are the same things okay so what we're gonna do is we are

31
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,020
好吧，我们要做的是基本上假设一个将军
okay so what we're gonna do is we are going to assume a general basically

32
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,030
好吧，我们要做的是基本上假设一个将军
going to assume a general basically Markov random field so and we're gonna

33
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,280
马尔可夫随机场，所以我们将使用与之相同的想法
going to assume a general basically Markov random field so and we're gonna

34
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,650
马尔可夫随机场，所以我们将使用与之相同的想法
Markov random field so and we're gonna use the same ideas we did for to it so

35
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:54,660
马尔可夫随机场，所以我们将使用与之相同的想法
use the same ideas we did for to it so you know you can take the mountain from

36
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,330
你知道你可以把整个山都拿走，说你知道，并且
use the same ideas we did for to it so you know you can take the mountain from

37
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,670
你知道你可以把整个山都拿走，说你知道，并且
you know you can take the mountain from the whole thing and say you know and

38
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:58,680
你知道你可以把整个山都拿走，说你知道，并且
the whole thing and say you know and whatever is from the bottom which are

39
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,800
不管是从底部到叶子都是什么，从某种意义上说都停止了
the whole thing and say you know and whatever is from the bottom which are

40
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,200
不管是从底部到叶子都是什么，从某种意义上说都停止了
whatever is from the bottom which are the leaves and in some sense stop

41
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,210
不管是从底部到叶子都是什么，从某种意义上说都停止了
the leaves and in some sense stop sending messages from the leaves to the

42
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,820
从叶子向根发送消息，这是收集证据步骤
the leaves and in some sense stop sending messages from the leaves to the

43
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,640
从叶子向根发送消息，这是收集证据步骤
sending messages from the leaves to the root that's the collect evidence step

44
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:07,650
从叶子向根发送消息，这是收集证据步骤
root that's the collect evidence step and then going from the roots all the

45
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,550
然后从根源一直到链接，直到我们准备好
root that's the collect evidence step and then going from the roots all the

46
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,680
然后从根源一直到链接，直到我们准备好
and then going from the roots all the way to the link before we are ready to

47
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:12,690
然后从根源一直到链接，直到我们准备好
way to the link before we are ready to calculate marginal can do inference

48
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:18,290
计算边际可以做推断
way to the link before we are ready to calculate marginal can do inference

49
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:18,460
所以因为我需要在信念传播这类概念中做到这一点
way to the link before we are ready to calculate marginal can do inference

50
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:18,470
所以因为我需要在信念传播这类概念中做到这一点


51
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,430
所以因为我需要在信念传播这类概念中做到这一点
so because I need to do this in the belief propagation sort of concept I'm

52
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:24,440
所以因为我需要在信念传播这类概念中做到这一点
belief propagation sort of concept I'm going to define what belief propagation

53
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,750
要定义什么是信念传播，所以我们做一个笔记-我的意思是一个笔记
belief propagation sort of concept I'm going to define what belief propagation

54
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,670
要定义什么是信念传播，所以我们做一个笔记-我的意思是一个笔记
going to define what belief propagation is so let's take a note - I mean a note

55
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:30,680
要定义什么是信念传播，所以我们做一个笔记-我的意思是一个笔记
is so let's take a note - I mean a note P but just silver Nessun you even though

56
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,990
P但只是银色的Nessun，即使您不知道有向图
is so let's take a note - I mean a note P but just silver Nessun you even though

57
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,530
P但只是银色的Nessun，即使您不知道有向图
P but just silver Nessun you even though this to not you know a directed graph

58
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:38,540
P但只是银色的Nessun，即使您不知道有向图
this to not you know a directed graph but you can think of this if you found

59
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,960
但是如果您再次从T中找到它，您可以想到这些，这些是邻居
this to not you know a directed graph but you can think of this if you found

60
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,420
但是如果您再次从T中找到它，您可以想到这些，这些是邻居
but you can think of this if you found it again from T these are the neighbors

61
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:45,430
但是如果您再次从T中找到它，您可以想到这些，这些是邻居
it again from T these are the neighbors directly connected with lists of the of

62
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,650
直接与孩子的名单相关联，因此我们定义了
it again from T these are the neighbors directly connected with lists of the of

63
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,320
直接与孩子的名单相关联，因此我们定义了
directly connected with lists of the of the children so we define that is called

64
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,330
直接与孩子的名单相关联，因此我们定义了
the children so we define that is called the bottom half belief state of the node

65
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,050
在给定的情况下，节点T的下半部置信状态为XT的概率
the children so we define that is called the bottom half belief state of the node

66
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,460
在给定的情况下，节点T的下半部置信状态为XT的概率
the bottom half belief state of the node T to be the probability of XT given the

67
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:57,470
在给定的情况下，节点T的下半部置信状态为XT的概率
T to be the probability of XT given the evidence from below all right

68
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,070
好的证据，所以这个想法是，你会注意到
T to be the probability of XT given the evidence from below all right

69
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,820
好的证据，所以这个想法是，你会注意到
evidence from below all right so the idea is that you notice the

70
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:03,830
好的证据，所以这个想法是，你会注意到
so the idea is that you notice the phrase the grafton this is the evidence

71
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,830
短语grafton这是来自右下方的证据，这是非常
so the idea is that you notice the phrase the grafton this is the evidence

72
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,430
短语grafton这是来自右下方的证据，这是非常
phrase the grafton this is the evidence coming from below right this is very

73
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
短语grafton这是来自右下方的证据，这是非常
coming from below right this is very important so this is what is called the

74
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,700
重要的是，这就是所谓的自下而上的信念状态
coming from below right this is very important so this is what is called the

75
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,760
重要的是，这就是所谓的自下而上的信念状态
important so this is what is called the bottom-up belief state as you go from

76
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:15,770
重要的是，这就是所谓的自下而上的信念状态
bottom-up belief state as you go from the leaves to the rope to define the

77
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,160
绳子上的叶子来定义每个节点的置信状态
bottom-up belief state as you go from the leaves to the rope to define the

78
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,780
绳子上的叶子来定义每个节点的置信状态
the leaves to the rope to define the belief state of every node and it

79
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:19,790
绳子上的叶子来定义每个节点的置信状态
belief state of every node and it represents the probability of XT given

80
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,150
考虑到下面的证据，现在表示XT的概率
belief state of every node and it represents the probability of XT given

81
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,840
考虑到下面的证据，现在表示XT的概率
represents the probability of XT given the evidence below alright now the idea

82
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:25,850
考虑到下面的证据，现在表示XT的概率
the evidence below alright now the idea is somehow the way we have done in the

83
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,260
是我们过去所学的方法，我们已经学会了如何传播
the evidence below alright now the idea is somehow the way we have done in the

84
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,330
是我们过去所学的方法，我们已经学会了如何传播
is somehow the way we have done in the past we have learned how to propagate

85
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:31,340
是我们过去所学的方法，我们已经学会了如何传播
past we have learned how to propagate vestiges from the tape from the timber

86
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,890
木材带子留下的痕迹很少，尤其是带电的
past we have learned how to propagate vestiges from the tape from the timber

87
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:40,560
木材带子留下的痕迹很少，尤其是带电的
vestiges from the tape from the timber last few and especially as charged

88
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:40,570
木材带子留下的痕迹很少，尤其是带电的
last few and especially as charged right and so effectively this message

89
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:45,460
对，如此有效，您在此处看到的此消息是
last few and especially as charged right and so effectively this message

90
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,070
对，如此有效，您在此处看到的此消息是
right and so effectively this message that you see here is the probability of

91
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
对，如此有效，您在此处看到的此消息是
that you see here is the probability of XT given this evidence and from the

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,000
XT给出了这些证据，从图表中您可以告诉我这些词是什么
that you see here is the probability of XT given this evidence and from the

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,620
XT给出了这些证据，从图表中您可以告诉我这些词是什么
XT given this evidence and from the graph can you tell me what the words

94
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:53,630
XT给出了这些证据，从图表中您可以告诉我这些词是什么
graph can you tell me what the words what evidence did I mean we did this in

95
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,070
我指的是什么意思，当我们与树木一起工作时，我们原则上做到了这一点，
graph can you tell me what the words what evidence did I mean we did this in

96
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,620
我指的是什么意思，当我们与树木一起工作时，我们原则上做到了这一点，
what evidence did I mean we did this in principle when we work with trees and

97
00:07:59,620 --> 00:07:59,630
我指的是什么意思，当我们与树木一起工作时，我们原则上做到了这一点，
principle when we work with trees and poly trees so this message is from s to

98
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:04,270
多边形树，所以该消息是从s到P的，实际上是P的概率，它
principle when we work with trees and poly trees so this message is from s to

99
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,420
多边形树，所以该消息是从s到P的，实际上是P的概率，它

is this you know the belief basically given what evidence

103
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:11,810
这是你知道的信念吗？
given what evidence what do you think this evidence is it

104
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,159
您认为这个证据是什么，先说V下标s和T，然后-

108
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,070
如果我有优势，这里的想法是什么
what's the idea here if I have an edge

109
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,080
如果我有优势，这里的想法是什么
if I have an edge let this be a speed - is the evidence

here below this blue coastline provides you know T okay and so similarly to this

126
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,150
您知道吗，与此消息类似，我们也将消息发送给
you know T okay and so similarly to this message we also have the message to the

127
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
您知道吗，与此消息类似，我们也将消息发送给
message we also have the message to the beauty etc so the bottom-up belief state

128
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,490
美女等，所以自上而下的信念状态T就是别的，
message we also have the message to the beauty etc so the bottom-up belief state

129
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:17,420
美女等，所以自上而下的信念状态T就是别的，
beauty etc so the bottom-up belief state of the know T it is nothing else but the

130
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:17,430
美女等，所以自上而下的信念状态T就是别的，
of the know T it is nothing else but the potential of the node X P times all the

messages that are coming from below alright so in this case two example this

134
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,370
好了，因此在这种情况下，这两个示例来自s和Q，因为该背心是
messages that are coming from below alright so in this case two example this

135
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,850
好了，因此在这种情况下，这两个示例来自s和Q，因为该背心是
alright so in this case two example this graph from s and Q because this vest is

136
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:29,860
好了，因此在这种情况下，这两个示例来自s和Q，因为该背心是
graph from s and Q because this vest is progressing you summarized all the

137
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,760
不断进步，您总结了我们自下而上获得的所有信念
graph from s and Q because this vest is progressing you summarized all the

138
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,060
不断进步，您总结了我们自下而上获得的所有信念
progressing you summarized all the belief that we get from the bottom down

139
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,070
不断进步，您总结了我们自下而上获得的所有信念
belief that we get from the bottom down okay so these are the children of T and

140
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,630
好的，所以这些是T的孩子，我再一次在宽泛的意义上使用它
belief that we get from the bottom down okay so these are the children of T and

141
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,820
好的，所以这些是T的孩子，我再一次在宽泛的意义上使用它
okay so these are the children of T and again I'm using this in a liberal sense

142
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:41,830
好的，所以这些是T的孩子，我再一次在宽泛的意义上使用它
again I'm using this in a liberal sense because this is not a directed graph

143
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,520
因为这不是我有孩子定义的有向图
again I'm using this in a liberal sense because this is not a directed graph

144
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,860
因为这不是我有孩子定义的有向图
because this is not a directed graph where I have a definition of children

145
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:46,870
因为这不是我有孩子定义的有向图
where I have a definition of children but you can see what this implies from

146
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,720
但是您可以从该图中看到这意味着什么，因此我们传播消息并
where I have a definition of children but you can see what this implies from

147
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,430
但是您可以从该图中看到这意味着什么，因此我们传播消息并
but you can see what this implies from this graph so we propagate messages and

148
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440
但是您可以从该图中看到这意味着什么，因此我们传播消息并
this graph so we propagate messages and the question is how do we compute this

149
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,620
问题是我们如何计算此消息以及如何计算此消息
this graph so we propagate messages and the question is how do we compute this

150
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,020
问题是我们如何计算此消息以及如何计算此消息
the question is how do we compute this messages and we compute this messages

151
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,030
问题是我们如何计算此消息以及如何计算此消息
messages and we compute this messages recursively the way we have done before

152
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,150
递归的方式，我们以前做过的，但现在写的略
messages and we compute this messages recursively the way we have done before

153
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,370
递归的方式，我们以前做过的，但现在写的略
recursively the way we have done before but now this is written slightly

154
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:02,380
递归的方式，我们以前做过的，但现在写的略
but now this is written slightly different so the message from below from

155
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,500
不同，因此从s到T的消息是从到的最大值s
but now this is written slightly different so the message from below from

156
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,350
不同，因此从s到T的消息是从到的最大值s
different so the message from below from s to T it is a maximization s of the

157
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:10,360
不同，因此从s到T的消息是从到的最大值s
s to T it is a maximization s of the joint potential of the non certainty

158
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,210
不确定性的共同潜能与我们之前所做的完全一样
s to T it is a maximization s of the joint potential of the non certainty

159
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,310
不确定性的共同潜能与我们之前所做的完全一样

不确定性的共同潜能与我们之前所做的完全一样
exactly as we have done before times the belief of first - the belief

161
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,980
乘以首先的信仰-不参加公共信仰的信仰，那是什么
exactly as we have done before times the belief of first - the belief

162
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,170
乘以首先的信仰-不参加公共信仰的信仰，那是什么
times the belief of first - the belief of no - coming communal so what is

163
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:22,180
乘以首先的信仰-不参加公共信仰的信仰，那是什么
of no - coming communal so what is really the belief subscript s -

164
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,290
确实是信念下标s-的证据来自否
of no - coming communal so what is really the belief subscript s -

165
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:33,320
确实是信念下标s-的证据来自否
really the belief subscript s - is evidence of comes from the no

is evidence of comes from the no s-tronic service you can think of this

167
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,550
s-tronic服务，您可以想到这一点，例如，所有消息都是
is evidence of comes from the no s-tronic service you can think of this

168
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,769
s-tronic服务，您可以想到这一点，例如，所有消息都是
s-tronic service you can think of this for example the all the message is

169
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:37,779
s-tronic服务，您可以想到这一点，例如，所有消息都是
for example the all the message is coming to us from its children but now

170
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:40,800
从它的孩子那里来到我们这里，但是现在我写的是，因为
for example the all the message is coming to us from its children but now

171
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,690
从它的孩子那里来到我们这里，但是现在我写的是，因为
coming to us from its children but now what I have done is I've written because

172
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:42,700
从它的孩子那里来到我们这里，但是现在我写的是，因为
what I have done is I've written because I define explicitly what this is for any

173
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,840
我现在明确地定义这是什么，我现在使用下面的信念
what I have done is I've written because I define explicitly what this is for any

174
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,550
我现在明确地定义这是什么，我现在使用下面的信念
I define explicitly what this is for any now I am using the belief from below for

175
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
我现在明确地定义这是什么，我现在使用下面的信念
now I am using the belief from below for now to write this equation in a slightly

176
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,769
现在以稍微不同的方式写这个方程式
now I am using the belief from below for now to write this equation in a slightly

177
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:53,840
现在以稍微不同的方式写这个方程式
now to write this equation in a slightly different manner

178
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:53,850
现在以稍微不同的方式写这个方程式
different manner so actually spelling cannabis lists how

179
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,940
因此，实际上拼写大麻列出了事情的正确写法，但是如果您
different manner so actually spelling cannabis lists how

180
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,160
因此，实际上拼写大麻列出了事情的正确写法，但是如果您
so actually spelling cannabis lists how things were written right but if you

181
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,170
因此，实际上拼写大麻列出了事情的正确写法，但是如果您
things were written right but if you don't like this definition you can go

182
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,440
不喜欢这个定义，你可以回到旧的方式，我的意思是
things were written right but if you don't like this definition you can go

183
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,810
不喜欢这个定义，你可以回到旧的方式，我的意思是
don't like this definition you can go back to the old way I mean the way with

184
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:03,820
不喜欢这个定义，你可以回到旧的方式，我的意思是
back to the old way I mean the way with discussions with messages but in the

185
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,750
通过消息进行讨论，但是在信念传播的背景下
back to the old way I mean the way with discussions with messages but in the

186
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,670
通过消息进行讨论，但是在信念传播的背景下
discussions with messages but in the context of belief propagation this

187
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:08,680
通过消息进行讨论，但是在信念传播的背景下
context of belief propagation this equation is written like a so if you

188
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,380
等式的写法是这样的，因此，如果您基本上是通过传播信念
context of belief propagation this equation is written like a so if you

189
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,260
等式的写法是这样的，因此，如果您基本上是通过传播信念
equation is written like a so if you propagate beliefs basically from

190
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,270
等式的写法是这样的，因此，如果您基本上是通过传播信念
propagate beliefs basically from evidence from below all the way to the

00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:31,700
玛莎拉蒂可以制造骨盆，还有一种额外的汽车炸弹
there's an extra sort of car bombs from this hopeless okay so here is and now

224
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,940
这是没有希望的，现在就可以开始分发了
there's an extra sort of car bombs from this hopeless okay so here is and now

225
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,380
这是没有希望的，现在就可以开始分发了
this hopeless okay so here is and now you're ready to start distributing

226
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:38,390
这是没有希望的，现在就可以开始分发了
you're ready to start distributing informational downwards to the same way

227
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,020
信息的向下传播与我们传递消息的方式相同，所以现在
you're ready to start distributing informational downwards to the same way

228
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,370
信息的向下传播与我们传递消息的方式相同，所以现在
informational downwards to the same way we have done with message passing so now

229
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:45,380
信息的向下传播与我们传递消息的方式相同，所以现在
we have done with message passing so now as we start sending messages that say

230
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,890
当我们开始发送从T到s的消息时，我们将更新我们
we have done with message passing so now as we start sending messages that say

231
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,240
当我们开始发送从T到s的消息时，我们将更新我们
as we start sending messages that say from T to s we are going to update us

232
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,250
当我们开始发送从T到s的消息时，我们将更新我们
from T to s we are going to update us then you notice now because when you

233
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,430
然后您会注意到，因为当您停止从T向s发送消息时，
from T to s we are going to update us then you notice now because when you

234
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,570
然后您会注意到，因为当您停止从T向s发送消息时，
then you notice now because when you stop message sending message from T to s

235
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:57,580
然后您会注意到，因为当您停止从T向s发送消息时，
stop message sending message from T to s actually with no accessories which is

236
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,630
实际上没有附件，这就是在所有情况下都可以访问的可能性
stop message sending message from T to s actually with no accessories which is

237
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,820
实际上没有附件，这就是在所有情况下都可以访问的可能性
actually with no accessories which is the probability of access given all the

238
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:03,830
实际上没有附件，这就是在所有情况下都可以访问的可能性
the probability of access given all the evidence because we accounted evidence

239
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,220
证据，因为我们考虑了来自banila的证据和一些会计证据
the probability of access given all the evidence because we accounted evidence

240
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,710
证据，因为我们考虑了来自banila的证据和一些会计证据
evidence because we accounted evidence from banila and some accounting evidence

00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
证据，因为我们考虑了来自banila的证据和一些会计证据
from banila and some accounting evidence from Abed all right so we the the belief

242
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,650
从阿贝德（Abed）好吧，所以我们认为X s的信念是给定V时X s的T，这是
from banila and some accounting evidence from Abed all right so we the the belief

243
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,550
从阿贝德（Abed）好吧，所以我们认为X s的信念是给定V时X s的T，这是
from Abed all right so we the the belief of X s is T of X s given V and it is

244
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:15,560
从阿贝德（Abed）好吧，所以我们认为X s的信念是给定V时X s的T，这是
of X s is T of X s given V and it is very simple is the belief you know it's

245
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,230
很简单的信念是，您知道这是自下而上的

00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,750
这则讯息会带给您北欧费的信念，但我将其除以
message will give you the belief of Nordics fee but I'm dividing it by the

386
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:36,760
这则讯息会带给您北欧费的信念，但我将其除以
Nordics fee but I'm dividing it by the message that essence today from below so

387
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,030
从下面传达今天的本质，那是什么，因为它们不会
Nordics fee but I'm dividing it by the message that essence today from below so

388
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:44,190
从下面传达今天的本质，那是什么，因为它们不会
message that essence today from below so what is that because they are not gonna

389
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:44,200
从下面传达今天的本质，那是什么，因为它们不会
what is that because they are not gonna circular knowledge a mess is not an

390
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,140
混乱的知识是不可替代的
what is that because they are not gonna circular knowledge a mess is not an

391
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,299
混乱的知识是不可替代的
circular knowledge a mess is not an alternative

392
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,180
生活是一样的方式，记得我们不这样做的时候，所以这是早期的私有化
circular knowledge a mess is not an alternative

393
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,190
生活是一样的方式，记得我们不这样做的时候，所以这是早期的私有化


394
00:18:51,190 --> 00:19:13,290
生活是一样的方式，记得我们不这样做的时候，所以这是早期的私有化
life is the same way remember when we don't so that's an early privatization

395
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:13,300
生活是一样的方式，记得我们不这样做的时候，所以这是早期的私有化
don't so that's an early privatization of the equations the way originally

396
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,990
方程式中最初引入信仰传播的方式
don't so that's an early privatization of the equations the way originally

397
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,500
方程式中最初引入信仰传播的方式
of the equations the way originally belief propagation was introduced in

398
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:19,510
方程式中最初引入信仰传播的方式
belief propagation was introduced in principle really I mean if you correctly

399
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,090
原则上，我的意思是，如果您正确地通过两种方式都将得到相同的答案
belief propagation was introduced in principle really I mean if you correctly

400
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,220
原则上，我的意思是，如果您正确地通过两种方式都将得到相同的答案
principle really I mean if you correctly both ways you will get the same answer

401
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,230
原则上，我的意思是，如果您正确地通过两种方式都将得到相同的答案
both ways you will get the same answer so one way to look is this way another

402
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,860
因此，一种看待方式是另一种方式是通过消息传递传递为
both ways you will get the same answer so one way to look is this way another

403
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,980
因此，一种看待方式是另一种方式是通过消息传递传递为
so one way to look is this way another way is with a message passing passing as

404
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:31,990
因此，一种看待方式是另一种方式是通过消息传递传递为
way is with a message passing passing as we did before so it's the same story all

405
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,750
我们之前做过，所以现在是相同的故事，迁移和您做得很好
way is with a message passing passing as we did before so it's the same story all

406
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:41,730
我们之前做过，所以现在是相同的故事，迁移和您做得很好
we did before so it's the same story all right now the migration and well you do

407
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:41,740
我们之前做过，所以现在是相同的故事，迁移和您做得很好
right now the migration and well you do this division as a song here is called

408
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,190
这种划分作为一首歌在这里被称为信仰更新俄语将是
right now the migration and well you do this division as a song here is called

409
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,130
这种划分作为一首歌在这里被称为信仰更新俄语将是
this division as a song here is called belief updating the Russian will be

410
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:47,140
这种划分作为一首歌在这里被称为信仰更新俄语将是
belief updating the Russian will be multiplied messages the way we have done

411
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,650
我们在前面的讲课中所做的事情是成倍增加的信息，实际上是
belief updating the Russian will be multiplied messages the way we have done

412
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,500
我们在前面的讲课中所做的事情是成倍增加的信息，实际上是
multiplied messages the way we have done in the earlier lectures is really the

413
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:51,510
我们在前面的讲课中所做的事情是成倍增加的信息，实际上是
in the earlier lectures is really the sum-product algorithm so that's what we

414
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,270
sum-product算法，这就是我们已经染过的东西，有了这个新的
in the earlier lectures is really the sum-product algorithm so that's what we

415
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,870
sum-product算法，这就是我们已经染过的东西，有了这个新的
sum-product algorithm so that's what we already have stained and with this new

416
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:56,880
sum-product算法，这就是我们已经染过的东西，有了这个新的
already have stained and with this new parameterization you get this concept of

417
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,460
参数化，您会得到这种信念更新的概念，没有消息更新就可以了
already have stained and with this new parameterization you get this concept of

418
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:05,750
参数化，您会得到这种信念更新的概念，没有消息更新就可以了
parameterization you get this concept of belief updating no messages update okay

419
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
参数化，您会得到这种信念更新的概念，没有消息更新就可以了
belief updating no messages update okay all right so this is it can happen that

420
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,260
好吧，这就是Southwick可能发生的情况
belief updating no messages update okay all right so this is it can happen that

421
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,250
好吧，这就是Southwick可能发生的情况
all right so this is it can happen that the Southwick

422
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:11,260
好吧，这就是Southwick可能发生的情况
the Southwick you know you are operate on a tree the

423
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,950
你知道你在树上操作情况很简单，你知道
the Southwick you know you are operate on a tree the

424
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,740
你知道你在树上操作情况很简单，你知道
you know you are operate on a tree the situation is very simple you know if

425
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:16,750
你知道你在树上操作情况很简单，你知道
situation is very simple you know if you're going to camp you know so let me

426
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:23,700
你要去扎营，你知道吗，所以让我看看这里
situation is very simple you know if you're going to camp you know so let me

427
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,490
你要去扎营，你知道吗，所以让我看看这里
you're going to camp you know so let me look here it says

428
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:26,600
实际上让我让我，因为这是在早期的幻灯片中，所以我们正在寻找
you're going to camp you know so let me look here it says

actually let me let me because this was in earlier slides okay so we are looking

431
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:32,670
实际上让我让我，因为这是在早期的幻灯片中，所以我们正在寻找
in earlier slides okay so we are looking now from the messages from top down all

432
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,240
现在从上到下的消息都可以从西边开始，好吧，所以我们只是
in earlier slides okay so we are looking now from the messages from top down all

433
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,140
现在从上到下的消息都可以从西边开始，好吧，所以我们只是
now from the messages from top down all right from feet west okay so we just

434
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,150
现在从上到下的消息都可以从西边开始，好吧，所以我们只是
right from feet west okay so we just noticed equation okay and we sent the

435
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,810
注意到方程式还行，我们从西边的脚发送了消息，给出了
right from feet west okay so we just noticed equation okay and we sent the

下面使用这种参数化来计算这些消息，以便您可以进行排序
below in computing these messages with this parametrization so you can put sort

464
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,080
下面使用这种参数化来计算这些消息，以便您可以进行排序
this parametrization so you can put sort of the meaning of this being a

465
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,330
这是有条件的后验概率的意思，但是
this parametrization so you can put sort of the meaning of this being a

466
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,190
这是有条件的后验概率的意思，但是
of the meaning of this being a conditional posterior probability but

467
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,200
这是有条件的后验概率的意思，但是
conditional posterior probability but the old way that we did right if you

468
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,550
如果您做不到的话，我们做对的旧方法就是
conditional posterior probability but the old way that we did right if you

469
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,770
如果您做不到的话，我们做对的旧方法就是
the old way that we did right if you cannot do that right so the

470
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:45,780
如果您做不到的话，我们做对的旧方法就是
cannot do that right so the interpretation is basically these

471
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,360
解释基本上是这些信息就像可能性囊泡
cannot do that right so the interpretation is basically these

472
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,210
解释基本上是这些信息就像可能性囊泡
interpretation is basically these messages are like likelihoods vesicle

473
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:50,220
解释基本上是这些信息就像可能性囊泡
messages are like likelihoods vesicle conditional likelihood

474
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,970
条件似然
messages are like likelihoods vesicle conditional likelihood

475
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,620
我的意思是您可以看到例如这是为一块而写的，这里没有
messages are like likelihoods vesicle conditional likelihood

476
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:54,630
我的意思是您可以看到例如这是为一块而写的，这里没有


477
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,539
我的意思是您可以看到例如这是为一块而写的，这里没有
I mean you can see in for example this is written for a piece here there's no

478
00:21:59,539 --> 00:21:59,549
我的意思是您可以看到例如这是为一块而写的，这里没有
is written for a piece here there's no message from below alright so you cannot

479
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:01,640
消息来自下面，所以您不能将其称为条件概率，因此
is written for a piece here there's no message from below alright so you cannot

480
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,500
消息来自下面，所以您不能将其称为条件概率，因此
message from below alright so you cannot call it the conditional probability so

481
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:06,510
消息来自下面，所以您不能将其称为条件概率，因此
call it the conditional probability so the protocol basically in simple terms

482
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:11,029
该协议基本上是简单的术语，所以我们将向您解释
call it the conditional probability so the protocol basically in simple terms

483
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:18,049
该协议基本上是简单的术语，所以我们将向您解释
the protocol basically in simple terms right so we'll explain if you go from to

484
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:18,059
该协议基本上是简单的术语，所以我们将向您解释
right so we'll explain if you go from to the list and then you can calculate any

485
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,630
列表，然后您就可以计算出任何种类的边际利益，
right so we'll explain if you go from to the list and then you can calculate any

486
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,390
列表，然后您就可以计算出任何种类的边际利益，
the list and then you can calculate any sort of marginal stuff of interest and

487
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:23,400
列表，然后您就可以计算出任何种类的边际利益，
sort of marginal stuff of interest and you can calculate the dictates but

488
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,390
您可以计算命令，但实际上您可以做的是
sort of marginal stuff of interest and you can calculate the dictates but

489
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,080
您可以计算命令，但实际上您可以做的是
you can calculate the dictates but actually what you can do is you can

490
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,090
您可以计算命令，但实际上您可以做的是
actually what you can do is you can initialize all the messages to something

these things because data simulation is important so I worship to get this

864
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,889
重要的是，我希望在我们经历这个过程时详细介绍这个概念
these things because data simulation is important so I worship to get this

重要的是，我希望在我们经历这个过程时详细介绍这个概念
concept in detail as we go through the course

867
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,080
当然可以，所以我们有25分钟的时间完成
concept in detail as we go through the course

868
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:49,080
当然可以，所以我们有25分钟的时间完成
course okay so we have 25 minutes to finish the

869
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,090
当然可以，所以我们有25分钟的时间完成
okay so we have 25 minutes to finish the junction 3 algorithm that we discussed

870
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,490
我们讨论过的路口3算法，基本上我不会做

00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:52,720
我们讨论过的路口3算法，基本上我不会做
and basically I'm not going to do anything you know some very

873
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,590
任何你知道的阿尔伯特的参数化，然后
and basically I'm not going to do anything you know some very

00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:25,000
一旦意识到将所有有向边替换为无向边
directed edges with undirected edges so here is organization making the path

888
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,099
这是组织制作路径Tektronix Plagne这条红线，这是

supposed to represent we want one correspondence I mean really that's not

897
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,450
对应，我的意思是说这不是问题，但是这里的可能性是
supposed to represent we want one correspondence I mean really that's not

这是一个比较复杂的示例，例如出口历史记录星球
export history planet so basically have to marry all of them straights not

906
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,410
嫁给他们所有的直道，不足以实际嫁给x2，而你

908
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:05,790
嫁给他们所有的直道，不足以实际嫁给x2，而你
sufficient to marry actually x2 and you say x1 is the husband of you and excuse

909
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:10,250
说x1是你的丈夫，请原谅x1是汽车的极端医院
sufficient to marry actually x2 and you say x1 is the husband of you and excuse

the hospital of extreme that x1 is a car politics the daily right no they have to

912
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:15,190
政治日常权利否，他们必须拥有个人证书
the hospital of extreme that x1 is a car politics the daily right no they have to

00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:18,230
政治日常权利否，他们必须拥有个人证书
politics the daily right no they have to have an individual certificate of

914
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:18,240
政治日常权利否，他们必须拥有个人证书
have an individual certificate of marriage here so we need to connect x1

915
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,660
结婚在这里，所以我们需要连接x1 x3也可以，那么这就是
have an individual certificate of marriage here so we need to connect x1

916
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,900
结婚在这里，所以我们需要连接x1 x3也可以，那么这就是
marriage here so we need to connect x1 x3 also okay then so this is how the

917
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:25,910
结婚在这里，所以我们需要连接x1 x3也可以，那么这就是
x3 also okay then so this is how the undirected graph will look like if you

918
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:29,360
如果您有证据要讨论此问题，则无向图将看起来像
x3 also okay then so this is how the undirected graph will look like if you

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:31,530
如果您有证据要讨论此问题，则无向图将看起来像
have evidence we want to discuss this really there is nothing specific you

921
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:34,250
真的，您不需要做任何特定的事情，只需要切成薄片
have evidence we want to discuss this really there is nothing specific you

922
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,920
真的，您不需要做任何特定的事情，只需要切成薄片
really there is nothing specific you need to do but take slices of these

923
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:36,930
真的，您不需要做任何特定的事情，只需要切成薄片
need to do but take slices of these potentials okay

924
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,600
通过固定到给定的值来确定潜在的可能性

926
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,010
通过固定到给定的值来确定潜在的可能性
by fixing to the given values whatever known to travelers you have so in this

927
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,250
旅行者知道的，在这种情况下，给出的是4 X 3和X 4

928
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,740
旅行者知道的，在这种情况下，给出的是4 X 3和X 4
known to travelers you have so in this case it's a 4 X 3 and X 4 are given

929
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:45,750
旅行者知道的，在这种情况下，给出的是4 X 3和X 4
case it's a 4 X 3 and X 4 are given effectively you take a two-dimensional

930
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,020
实际上，您可以从一个二维切片中获取这一维
case it's a 4 X 3 and X 4 are given effectively you take a two-dimensional

931
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,390
实际上，您可以从一个二维切片中获取这一维
effectively you take a two-dimensional slice from let's say this one dimension

932
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:50,400
实际上，您可以从一个二维切片中获取这一维
slice from let's say this one dimension table human dimensions lines etc and in

933
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,020
表人的尺寸线等，原则上平面节点在此
slice from let's say this one dimension table human dimensions lines etc and in

934
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,320
表人的尺寸线等，原则上平面节点在此
table human dimensions lines etc and in principle the plane nodes in this

935
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,330
表人的尺寸线等，原则上平面节点在此
principle the plane nodes in this problem become X 1 X 2 X 5 X 6 and

936
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:00,020
问题变成X 1 X 2 X 5 X 6和exedrin，从字面上您可以想到
principle the plane nodes in this problem become X 1 X 2 X 5 X 6 and

937
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:04,280
问题变成X 1 X 2 X 5 X 6和exedrin，从字面上您可以想到
problem become X 1 X 2 X 5 X 6 and excedrin and literally you can think of

938
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,290
问题变成X 1 X 2 X 5 X 6和exedrin，从字面上您可以想到
excedrin and literally you can think of this equation X 1 X 2 I'll separate it

939
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:08,300
这个方程X 1 X 2我将它与X 5 X 6和X 7分开
excedrin and literally you can think of this equation X 1 X 2 I'll separate it

940
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,030
这个方程X 1 X 2我将它与X 5 X 6和X 7分开
this equation X 1 X 2 I'll separate it from X 5 X 6 and X 7

941
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,040
这个方程X 1 X 2我将它与X 5 X 6和X 7分开
from X 5 X 6 and X 7 so maybe you can do this sort of

942
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,500
所以也许您可以在一个非常琐碎的事情中进行这种推论
from X 5 X 6 and X 7 so maybe you can do this sort of

943
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,900
所以也许您可以在一个非常琐碎的事情中进行这种推论
so maybe you can do this sort of inference short opener in a very trivial

944
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:14,910
所以也许您可以在一个非常琐碎的事情中进行这种推论
inference short opener in a very trivial manner you don't really have to mix

945
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:19,040
您实际上不需要将不依赖的事物混合在一起的方式

947
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:20,730
您实际上不需要将不依赖的事物混合在一起的方式
things together that don't depend on each other the next step was to let me

948
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:36,110
彼此的下一步是让我看到已经写在这里的

959
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:52,910
现代化之后非常重要，我们必须做什么
after modernization what do we have to do to create clicks that they are not

960
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,410
要做的是创建不属于您的点击，您知道它们不会导致您
after modernization what do we have to do to create clicks that they are not

961
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,819
要做的是创建不属于您的点击，您知道它们不会导致您

962
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:57,829
要做的是创建不属于您的点击，您知道它们不会导致您
you know they don't lead to you just basically then was the best word we use

963
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:00,989
基本上，那是我们用来做连接树的最好的词
you know they don't lead to you just basically then was the best word we use

964
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:05,259

you had today was not there that was what is the step you have to do

972
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:25,420
在开始获得工作之前，您基本要做的步骤是什么
you had today was not there that was what is the step you have to do

each other that's what the algorithm actually try to obtain but consistency

1104
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:11,450
实际上试图获得但使两个组织平等的一致性
each other that's what the algorithm actually try to obtain but consistency

1105
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:13,700
实际上试图获得但使两个组织平等的一致性
actually try to obtain but consistency that makes the two organizations equal

1106
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:13,710
实际上试图获得但使两个组织平等的一致性
that makes the two organizations equal to each other

1107
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:14,510
彼此之间，因此在某种意义上具有耗散性
that makes the two organizations equal to each other

1108
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:17,660
彼此之间，因此在某种意义上具有耗散性
to each other so in some sense having dissipators

1109
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:17,670
彼此之间，因此在某种意义上具有耗散性
so in some sense having dissipators that's what they will do so the sending

1110
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:21,050
这就是他们将要执行的操作，因此发送消息基本上就是两次单击
so in some sense having dissipators that's what they will do so the sending

1111
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,990
这就是他们将要执行的操作，因此发送消息基本上就是两次单击
that's what they will do so the sending message is basically this two clicks to

1112
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:24,000
这就是他们将要执行的操作，因此发送消息基本上就是两次单击
message is basically this two clicks to each other in a way that when given two

1113
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,300
彼此的方式是，当给定两个盟友时，这与a和您有关
message is basically this two clicks to each other in a way that when given two

1114
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,120
彼此的方式是，当给定两个盟友时，这与a和您有关
each other in a way that when given two allies this with respect to a and you

1115
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,130
彼此的方式是，当给定两个盟友时，这与a和您有关
allies this with respect to a and you marginalize this with respect to see

1116
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:31,130
边际化这一点，以了解如何以某种方式获得一致
allies this with respect to a and you marginalize this with respect to see

1117
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,590
边际化这一点，以了解如何以某种方式获得一致
marginalize this with respect to see somehow you can get a consistent

1118
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:33,600
边际化这一点，以了解如何以某种方式获得一致
somehow you can get a consistent calculate

1119
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,260
计算的分隔符应在
somehow you can get a consistent calculate

1120
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:40,980
计算的分隔符应在
calculate of the separator for then shall be in

1121
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:40,990
计算的分隔符应在
of the separator for then shall be in the process yes absolutely and this is

1122
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:46,230
这个过程是绝对的，这就是我们今天要讨论的，是的，所以我们
of the separator for then shall be in the process yes absolutely and this is

1123
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:49,280
这个过程是绝对的，这就是我们今天要讨论的，是的，所以我们
the process yes absolutely and this is what we will discuss today yes so we

1124
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:49,290
这个过程是绝对的，这就是我们今天要讨论的，是的，所以我们
what we will discuss today yes so we think and then it was talking to rating

1125
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:52,650
思考，然后在谈论评分，您给我发了一条消息，我给您发了一条
what we will discuss today yes so we think and then it was talking to rating

1126
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,750
思考，然后在谈论评分，您给我发了一条消息，我给您发了一条
think and then it was talking to rating you sent me a message I sent you a

1127
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:54,760
思考，然后在谈论评分，您给我发了一条消息，我给您发了一条
you sent me a message I sent you a message everybody sends messages to each

1128
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,310
消息，每个人都互相发送消息，直到我们都高兴起来，好吧，所以
you sent me a message I sent you a message everybody sends messages to each

1129
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:01,920
消息，每个人都互相发送消息，直到我们都高兴起来，好吧，所以
message everybody sends messages to each other until we're all happy okay so

1130
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:01,930
消息，每个人都互相发送消息，直到我们都高兴起来，好吧，所以
other until we're all happy okay so where's my desk I told you way too much

1131
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:03,780
我告诉你的桌子在哪里，太多的信息，让我们随着情节的来临
other until we're all happy okay so where's my desk I told you way too much

1132
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,810
我告诉你的桌子在哪里，太多的信息，让我们随着情节的来临
where's my desk I told you way too much information so let's as the plots come

1133
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:06,820
我告诉你的桌子在哪里，太多的信息，让我们随着情节的来临
information so let's as the plots come again we will see this again so we get

1134
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:10,650
再次，我们将再次看到它，所以我们得到了主要的东西，然后这就是火车
information so let's as the plots come again we will see this again so we get

1135
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:14,100
再次，我们将再次看到它，所以我们得到了主要的东西，然后这就是火车
again we will see this again so we get the main so then this is the Train on

1136
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:14,110
再次，我们将再次看到它，所以我们得到了主要的东西，然后这就是火车
the main so then this is the Train on directed and you can see the

1137
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:17,010
指导，您可以看到三角剖分过程，所以我们
the main so then this is the Train on directed and you can see the

1138
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:21,000
指导，您可以看到三角剖分过程，所以我们
directed and you can see the triangulation process all right so we

1139
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,010
指导，您可以看到三角剖分过程，所以我们
triangulation process all right so we connected this block if the edges are

1140
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,810
如果边是边，则连接此块，这是行程的定义，并且
triangulation process all right so we connected this block if the edges are

1141
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:26,160
如果边是边，则连接此块，这是行程的定义，并且
connected this block if the edges are this is the definition of the trip and

1142
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:26,170
如果边是边，则连接此块，这是行程的定义，并且
this is the definition of the trip and effectively the message that I think we

1143
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:31,320
实际上，我认为我们通过上一堂课的信息是
this is the definition of the trip and effectively the message that I think we

1144
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:51,360
实际上，我认为我们通过上一堂课的信息是
effectively the message that I think we passed last lecture was that so there

1145
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:51,370
实际上，我认为我们通过上一堂课的信息是
passed last lecture was that so there are many ways we can pose some what we

1146
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:54,540
我们可以通过多种方式提出一些我们所说的内容，我们将选择一种
passed last lecture was that so there are many ways we can pose some what we

1147
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,010
我们可以通过多种方式提出一些我们所说的内容，我们将选择一种
are many ways we can pose some what we said we are going to choose the one that

1148
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:56,020
我们可以通过多种方式提出一些我们所说的内容，我们将选择一种
said we are going to choose the one that maximizes something and what is the many

1149
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:02,280
最大化某些东西，应该使用哪些挑战？
said we are going to choose the one that maximizes something and what is the many

1150
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,460
最大化某些东西，应该使用哪些挑战？
maximizes something and what is the many challenges which one should be used so

1151
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:05,470
最大化某些东西，应该使用哪些挑战？
challenges which one should be used so in this case we have this trade that has

1152
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:08,280
在这种情况下，我们有两个独立的交易，每个交易有两个
challenges which one should be used so in this case we have this trade that has

1153
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,900
在这种情况下，我们有两个独立的交易，每个交易有两个
in this case we have this trade that has two separate first each of them has two

1154
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:09,910
在这种情况下，我们有两个独立的交易，每个交易有两个
two separate first each of them has two elements and then we have this 3 which

1155
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:12,030
元素，然后我们得到这3分，即30分钟，他有一个元素
two separate first each of them has two elements and then we have this 3 which

1156
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,630
元素，然后我们得到这3分，即30分钟，他有一个元素
elements and then we have this 3 which is 30 minute and he has one element of

1157
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:15,640
元素，然后我们得到这3分，即30分钟，他有一个元素
is 30 minute and he has one element of this separator and turned out whatever

1158
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,600
这个分隔符，结果随你喜欢
is 30 minute and he has one element of this separator and turned out whatever

1159
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,300
这个分隔符，结果随你喜欢
this separator and turned out whatever you like

1160
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,310
我们必须重新定义最大生成树，因为您知道我们将其称为
this separator and turned out whatever you like

1161
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:24,320
我们必须重新定义最大生成树，因为您知道我们将其称为


1162
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:30,140
我们必须重新定义最大生成树，因为您知道我们将其称为
we have to redefine the maximum spanning tree with you know we will call it the

1163
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:30,150
我们必须重新定义最大生成树，因为您知道我们将其称为
tree with you know we will call it the junction tree and when we say the

1164
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,120
结点树，当我们说最大生成树的最大值为
tree with you know we will call it the junction tree and when we say the

1165
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,220
结点树，当我们说最大生成树的最大值为
junction tree and when we say the maximum spanning tree maximal with

1166
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:34,230
结点树，当我们说最大生成树的最大值为
maximum spanning tree maximal with respect to what he has too much my son

1167
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:40,520
尊重他拥有太多我的儿子，所以如果你看这些日子，
maximum spanning tree maximal with respect to what he has too much my son

1168
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,690
尊重他拥有太多我的儿子，所以如果你看这些日子，
respect to what he has too much my son tree so if you look at verse days what

1169
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:44,700
尊重他拥有太多我的儿子，所以如果你看这些日子，
tree so if you look at verse days what is the time between the two three

1170
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,170
是两个三个之间的时间
tree so if you look at verse days what is the time between the two three

1171
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:54,270
好吧，答案是你必须看看分隔符
tree so if you look at verse days what is the time between the two three

1172
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:54,280
好吧，答案是你必须看看分隔符


1173
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,710
好吧，答案是你必须看看分隔符
well the answer is you have to look at the separator

1174
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:58,720
好吧，答案是你必须看看分隔符
what is littering the separators invest twit P and in this the number of no all

1175
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:07,950
乱丢垃圾的人投资了P，在这个数目中，没有全部
what is littering the separators invest twit P and in this the number of no all

1176
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:07,960
乱丢垃圾的人投资了P，在这个数目中，没有全部
twit P and in this the number of no all right so here we have 2 + 10 + 2 + 2 is

1177
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,130
对，所以这里我们有2 + 10 + 2 + 2大于1 + 2 3
twit P and in this the number of no all right so here we have 2 + 10 + 2 + 2 is

1178
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:22,320
对，所以这里我们有2 + 10 + 2 + 2大于1 + 2 3
right so here we have 2 + 10 + 2 + 2 is greater than 1 + 2 3 and these lots of

1179
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,330
对，所以这里我们有2 + 10 + 2 + 2大于1 + 2 3
greater than 1 + 2 3 and these lots of heuristic algorithms on how to do this

1180
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:24,180
关于如何执行此启发式算法的实际计算非常困难

1182
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:28,120
关于如何执行此启发式算法的实际计算非常困难
the actual calculation is a very hard one you know for a complex 3 but using

1183
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,740
你知道一个复杂的3，但是使用经验方法可以很好地完成工作
the actual calculation is a very hard one you know for a complex 3 but using

1188
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:39,550
在这种情况下，自然技巧具有最大的基数总分隔符
separator of cardinality in this case for example you can notice here is the

1189
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:44,610
例如，您可以注意到这里的基数仍然是10加2
separator of cardinality in this case for example you can notice here is the

1190
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:48,750
例如，您可以注意到这里的基数仍然是10加2
for example you can notice here is the cardinality here is still so 10 plus 2

1191
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:48,760
例如，您可以注意到这里的基数仍然是10加2
cardinality here is still so 10 plus 2 is greater than 1 plus I'm sorry 1 plus

1192
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,920
大于1加上我很抱歉1加上2在行进的交叉路口还可以
cardinality here is still so 10 plus 2 is greater than 1 plus I'm sorry 1 plus

1193
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:59,640
大于1加上我很抱歉1加上2在行进的交叉路口还可以
is greater than 1 plus I'm sorry 1 plus plus 2 okay in the running intersection

00:47:59,640 --> 00:47:59,650
大于1加上我很抱歉1加上2在行进的交叉路口还可以
plus 2 okay in the running intersection property is what we discussed before it

00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,800
属性是我们之前讨论过的，您知道这个和这个之间的这个自我
property is what we discussed before it you know this self between this and this

1197
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:04,810
属性是我们之前讨论过的，您知道这个和这个之间的这个自我
you know this self between this and this next it has to be stare constant but any

1198
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:07,410
接下来它必须保持凝视不变，但是在路径之间的任何其他单击都可以
you know this self between this and this next it has to be stare constant but any

1199
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:10,320

they things to I all right maybe this picture is know that proper to general

1343
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:00,530
图片是知道适合一般约会的东西，实际上我知道你知道吗
they things to I all right maybe this picture is know that proper to general

1344
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:08,210
图片是知道适合一般约会的东西，实际上我知道你知道吗
picture is know that proper to general dating see I actually you know was it

1345
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:08,220
图片是知道适合一般约会的东西，实际上我知道你知道吗
dating see I actually you know was it thank you here actually thinking if it's

1346
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,790
谢谢你，在这里，我在想这是否是因为我出差吓到了
dating see I actually you know was it thank you here actually thinking if it's

1347
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:14,780
谢谢你，在这里，我在想这是否是因为我出差吓到了
thank you here actually thinking if it's because me from business out scare okay

1348
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:14,790
谢谢你，在这里，我在想这是否是因为我出差吓到了
because me from business out scare okay so basically all the messages of the

1349
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:18,200
所以基本上所有的消息都是从没有男人的孩子那里传播来的
because me from business out scare okay so basically all the messages of the

1350
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,260
所以基本上所有的消息都是从没有男人的孩子那里传播来的
so basically all the messages of the propagated from the children of no guy

1351
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:20,270
所以基本上所有的消息都是从没有男人的孩子那里传播来的
propagated from the children of no guy okay so basically you know I had one

1352
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:24,560
好的，所以基本上您知道我有一个图形，他们必须使用它才能使用
propagated from the children of no guy okay so basically you know I had one

1353
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,440
好的，所以基本上您知道我有一个图形，他们必须使用它才能使用
okay so basically you know I had one graphing they have to use it you can use

1354
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:27,450
好的，所以基本上您知道我有一个图形，他们必须使用它才能使用
graphing they have to use it you can use the industries and give them the right

1355
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:29,000
行业，并为他们提供对您想要的方式的正确解释
graphing they have to use it you can use the industries and give them the right

1356
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:37,790
行业，并为他们提供对您想要的方式的正确解释
the industries and give them the right interpretation of the way you wanted a

1357
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:37,800
行业，并为他们提供对您想要的方式的正确解释
interpretation of the way you wanted a physical IJ and because mister natality

1358
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,580
身体上的IJ，并且因为先生的出生天分处理了我们需要做的是
interpretation of the way you wanted a physical IJ and because mister natality

1359
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,910
身体上的IJ，并且因为先生的出生天分处理了我们需要做的是
physical IJ and because mister natality processed what we need to do is we need

1360
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:43,920
身体上的IJ，并且因为先生的出生天分处理了我们需要做的是
processed what we need to do is we need to update the messages without basically

1361
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:51,260
在基本上不分离潜在问题的情况下更新消息，因此请看
processed what we need to do is we need to update the messages without basically

1362
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,650
在基本上不分离潜在问题的情况下更新消息，因此请看
to update the messages without basically separate the potential okay and so look

1363
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:54,660
在基本上不分离潜在问题的情况下更新消息，因此请看
separate the potential okay and so look at this equation carefully and and

1364
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,930
在这个方程式上仔细地尝试并尝试赋予一些个人意义
separate the potential okay and so look at this equation carefully and and

1365
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:59,150
在这个方程式上仔细地尝试并尝试赋予一些个人意义
at this equation carefully and and trying to give some personal meaning to

1366
00:54:59,150 --> 00:54:59,160
在这个方程式上仔细地尝试并尝试赋予一些个人意义
trying to give some personal meaning to what it takes

1367
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,760
需要什么
trying to give some personal meaning to what it takes

1368
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,090
所以这是一种定义权，但是您可以认为这是
trying to give some personal meaning to what it takes

1369
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:05,100
所以这是一种定义权，但是您可以认为这是


1370
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:11,300
所以这是一种定义权，但是您可以认为这是
so this is sort of a definition right but this you can think of this being the

1371
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:11,310
所以这是一种定义权，但是您可以认为这是
but this you can think of this being the amazing potential of the separator s9j

1372
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:16,970
分离器s9j的惊人潜力
but this you can think of this being the amazing potential of the separator s9j

1373
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:17,500
所以这个等式说了今天来自Lodi的其他关于斋戒的信息
but this you can think of this being the amazing potential of the separator s9j

1374
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:17,510
所以这个等式说了今天来自Lodi的其他关于斋戒的信息


1375
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:26,110
所以这个等式说了今天来自Lodi的其他关于斋戒的信息
so what this equation says the other information of the fast from Lodi today

1376
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:26,120
所以这个等式说了今天来自Lodi的其他关于斋戒的信息
information of the fast from Lodi today we have to integrate over modernist

1377
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,000
我们必须整合现代主义者，除了那些包含一个单独的他们
information of the fast from Lodi today we have to integrate over modernist

1378
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,770
我们必须整合现代主义者，除了那些包含一个单独的他们
we have to integrate over modernist except the ones contain a separate them

1379
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:30,780
我们必须整合现代主义者，除了那些包含一个单独的他们
except the ones contain a separate them but the notice here there's a division

1380
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,750
但是这里的通知有一个惊喜
except the ones contain a separate them but the notice here there's a division

1381
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:35,600
但是这里的通知有一个惊喜
but the notice here there's a division from surprise

1382
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:48,830
再次与您的概念有关
but the notice here there's a division from surprise

1383
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:48,840
再次与您的概念有关


1384
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:53,870
再次与您的概念有关
and again this is related to what your concept

1385
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:58,130
我要用精确的计算说服您，为什么这行得通，但是
and again this is related to what your concept

1386
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:58,140
我要用精确的计算说服您，为什么这行得通，但是


1387
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:02,769
我要用精确的计算说服您，为什么这行得通，但是
I'm gonna convince you with a precise calculation why this works right but

1388
00:56:02,769 --> 00:56:02,779
我要用精确的计算说服您，为什么这行得通，但是
calculation why this works right but shared this division is very similar to

1389
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:05,930
共享此部门与具有信念的部门非常相似
calculation why this works right but shared this division is very similar to

1390
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:07,430
共享此部门与具有信念的部门非常相似
shared this division is very similar to the division who has the belief

1391
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:07,440
共享此部门与具有信念的部门非常相似
the division who has the belief propagation algorithm respectively why

1392
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,680
传播算法分别为什么在分母中有这个
the division who has the belief propagation algorithm respectively why

1393
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,069
传播算法分别为什么在分母中有这个
propagation algorithm respectively why do we have this in the denominator

1394
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:21,200
你没有告诉英联邦我从杰克那里得到的信息，我们没人怀疑
propagation algorithm respectively why do we have this in the denominator

1395
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:21,210
你没有告诉英联邦我从杰克那里得到的信息，我们没人怀疑


1396

你没有告诉英联邦我从杰克那里得到的信息，我们没人怀疑
from Jake are we no one can doubt melancholy the message that basically

1398
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:30,230
忧郁的信息，基本上是野牛链的味道，所以这
from Jake are we no one can doubt melancholy the message that basically

1399
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,599
忧郁的信息，基本上是野牛链的味道，所以这
melancholy the message that basically the Bison taste of chains so this

1400
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:32,609
忧郁的信息，基本上是野牛链的味道，所以这
the Bison taste of chains so this calculation

1401
00:56:32,609 --> 00:56:34,790
计算
the Bison taste of chains so this calculation

1402
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:39,160
好吧好吧好吧
the Bison taste of chains so this calculation

1403
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:39,170

听起来不错，我们将展示正确的内容
that sounds good we will show right what obviously

1420
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:18,980
听起来不错，我们将展示正确的内容
we will show right what obviously passing messages can wait to battle you

1421
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,400
