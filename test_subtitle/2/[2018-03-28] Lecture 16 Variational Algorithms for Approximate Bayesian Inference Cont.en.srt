1
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:39,660
why so we left the previous lecture so this is for those that was based on

2
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,130
this is for those that was based on lying this is the earlier lecture on

3
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,170
lying this is the earlier lecture on introduction to approximate Bayesian

4
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,780
introduction to approximate Bayesian inference what's right was the other one

5
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:56,730
inference what's right was the other one I had you forgot okay we locate it so

6
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,070
I had you forgot okay we locate it so we're going to continue on that every

7
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,980
we're going to continue on that every lecture there was this icing example

8
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,990
lecture there was this icing example that I went rapidly so let's review it

9
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,690
that I went rapidly so let's review it because it's very fundamental to lots of

10
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:16,290
because it's very fundamental to lots of areas all right so obviously you have

11
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,890
areas all right so obviously you have worked on lists in the homework we

12
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,760
worked on lists in the homework we assume here we have some observations

13
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,180
assume here we have some observations why but are defined let's say pixel wise

14
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,890
why but are defined let's say pixel wise and X maybe the tradition image this is

15
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,510
and X maybe the tradition image this is some noisy version of the image and

16
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,640
some noisy version of the image and these are the original pictures we try

17
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,780
these are the original pictures we try to estimate so there is no see here so

18
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,610
to estimate so there is no see here so you can think the unknowns basically are

19
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,650
you can think the unknowns basically are X this is what we want to do an

20
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:47,360
X this is what we want to do an inference and so we've worked with the

21
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,310
inference and so we've worked with the joint and the posterior with with some

22
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,340
joint and the posterior with with some prior the prior is basically standard

23
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,460
prior the prior is basically standard for this type of payments is is gift

24
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,900
for this type of payments is is gift like distribution e to the minus e0 some

25
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,740
like distribution e to the minus e0 some energy functional that accounts for

26
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,360
energy functional that accounts for nearest neighbors basically interactions

27
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,610
nearest neighbors basically interactions okay this is sort of very typical of

28
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,700
okay this is sort of very typical of massaging models these are some

29
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,710
massaging models these are some coefficients given here excited day

30
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,190
coefficients given here excited day they're binary variables plus minus one

31
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:25,260
they're binary variables plus minus one okay all right so we like the likelihood

32
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,990
okay all right so we like the likelihood locally is the product for all eyes on

33
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,140
locally is the product for all eyes on why I given the probability of Y given X

34
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,840
why I given the probability of Y given X I and we write this probability so we

35
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,680
I and we write this probability so we can

36
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,410
can make the algebra to look nice has to get

37
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,470
make the algebra to look nice has to get to the power a lie so the total

38
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,300
to the power a lie so the total likelihood basically is the exponential

39
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,880
likelihood basically is the exponential of the summation of this energy cell I

40
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,270
of the summation of this energy cell I of X I okay so that way we can write the

41
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,230
of X I okay so that way we can write the posterior as if to the mind of some

42
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,660
posterior as if to the mind of some energy for the energies these little

43
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,900
energy for the energies these little miners destination of the local evidence

44
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,720
miners destination of the local evidence which okay so what we want is we want to

45
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,360
which okay so what we want is we want to compute an approximation to this

46
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,790
compute an approximation to this posterior all right that's our objective

47
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,540
posterior all right that's our objective I mean you can this turn is an easy

48
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,610
I mean you can this turn is an easy problem you can directly work with it so

49
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,020
problem you can directly work with it so you don't really need an approximation

50
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,810
you don't really need an approximation this chain is a going distribution but

51
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,270
this chain is a going distribution but we say well you know we want to

52
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,720
we say well you know we want to factorize QX in a nice form that is

53
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,720
factorize QX in a nice form that is factorizable i alright so for each i

54
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,170
factorizable i alright so for each i we're going to have the corresponding Q

55
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,940
we're going to have the corresponding Q I of X I and because X I is plus minus 2

56
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,340
I of X I and because X I is plus minus 2 R is discrete the only thing we need to

57
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,410
R is discrete the only thing we need to describe it with distributions is the

58
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:47,850
describe it with distributions is the mean value okay the fundamental equation

59
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,840
mean value okay the fundamental equation that we derived for each of this factor

60
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,040
that we derived for each of this factor so if you have to remind me

61
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,730
so if you have to remind me so we did the derivation or elliptically

62
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,940
so we did the derivation or elliptically and we sell it factor qi or the longer

63
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,380
and we sell it factor qi or the longer fits not the dry is equal to what the

64
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,970
fits not the dry is equal to what the expectation of

65
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:09,980


66
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:16,490
police response was this fundamental to fire some problems is faster Qi is limit

67
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:32,549
fire some problems is faster Qi is limit Y is equal to

68
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:32,559


69
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:37,709
I mean I can go outside they don't take a break for one hour until you guys tell

70
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:41,809
a break for one hour until you guys tell me what the formula is whatever works

71
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:41,819


72
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:48,479
solution Qi I'm a chef with an index there Qi but it told this from the

73
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,159
there Qi but it told this from the arguments the log of G is equal to the

74
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:59,399
arguments the log of G is equal to the expectation of what

75
00:06:59,399 --> 00:06:59,409


76
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:05,429
you know as you get older you hear less but is by design you want to remove on

77
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:09,449
but is by design you want to remove on the knowledge all right so the rumble Qi

78
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:17,520
the knowledge all right so the rumble Qi equal to the expectation

79
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:17,530


80
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:27,450
why you look at me I mean either it's better or not

81
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:27,460


82
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,530
most of what distribution we have the expectation of the love of what

83
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:37,890
expectation of the love of what distribution before one with the other

84
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,790
distribution before one with the other in general right we had observable X and

85
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,760
in general right we had observable X and we had less enviable Z so what

86
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,600
we had less enviable Z so what distribution the right-hand side what

87
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,620
distribution the right-hand side what the question was referring to the joint

88
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,010
the question was referring to the joint was a likelihood right that was the

89
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,290
was a likelihood right that was the starting point so the joint of like

90
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,470
starting point so the joint of like leave it here especially could've missed

91
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,330
leave it here especially could've missed all right so we started the of

92
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,210
all right so we started the of this factor really is nothing at the

93
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,280
this factor really is nothing at the language of these factors is the

94
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,470
language of these factors is the expectation or please doing log

95
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,480
expectation or please doing log likelihood which is basically minus this

96
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,930
likelihood which is basically minus this energy you take the logs this is we're

97
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,310
energy you take the logs this is we're talking about the UH normalized thing

98
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,660
talking about the UH normalized thing clear so it's minus the energy effects

99
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,810
clear so it's minus the energy effects so so the number of the joint of

100
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,200
so so the number of the joint of likelihood is obviously easier as this

101
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,580
likelihood is obviously easier as this right so with the - time it will be

102
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,650
right so with the - time it will be external times the summation of all the

103
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:39,540
external times the summation of all the neighbors of I plus ally of X I and I is

104
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,350
neighbors of I plus ally of X I and I is many many problems and I think this

105
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:48,210
many many problems and I think this reflects I to be a problem because I'm

106
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,660
reflects I to be a problem because I'm gonna said the Qi which is a function of

107
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,650
gonna said the Qi which is a function of X I write equal to what the expectation

108
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,660
X I write equal to what the expectation of this and I want to identify only the

109
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,060
of this and I want to identify only the terms the depend on X I write the main

110
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,280
terms the depend on X I write the main things that they wouldn't make any

111
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,100
things that they wouldn't make any difference in the context of excise all

112
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,500
difference in the context of excise all right and now we have to take to define

113
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,980
right and now we have to take to define the longer fly when you have to take the

114
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,300
the longer fly when you have to take the expectation of this with respect to work

115
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,310


116
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:28,079
we equation a variational methods driving the lava pits variation

117
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,840
driving the lava pits variation distribution dry is the expectation of

118
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,960
distribution dry is the expectation of this joint of likelihood with respect to

119
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:44,880
this joint of likelihood with respect to what horrible mean field approximation

120
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:44,890


121
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:51,760
reversed mother sorry so when the pain expectation of this with respect to all

122
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,790
expectation of this with respect to all other body most

123
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,140
other body most you're not going to datsuk tie right

124
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,750
you're not going to datsuk tie right because it's a lot of re most part istic

125
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,760
because it's a lot of re most part istic days you have been a substitute them

126
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,970
days you have been a substitute them with what my definition with there are

127
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,770
with what my definition with there are many values because their expressions

128
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,590
many values because their expressions are what is the mean values of XJ is

129
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:19,630
are what is the mean values of XJ is near J alright so we said that the

130
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,760
near J alright so we said that the longer Qi was equal to that sir Qi is

131
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,430
longer Qi was equal to that sir Qi is the exponential of next high times

132
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,390
the exponential of next high times destination over the neighbors of I plus

133
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,940
destination over the neighbors of I plus the local evidence will depend on your

134
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,060
the local evidence will depend on your exile alright because X I can only take

135
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,950
exile alright because X I can only take values plus one and minus one there so

136
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,590
values plus one and minus one there so I'm introducing two different

137
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,980
I'm introducing two different definitions here Li plus is the value

138
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,160
definitions here Li plus is the value for life when X is equal to one Li minus

139
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,440
for life when X is equal to one Li minus the value of a life when exhale equal to

140
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,990
the value of a life when exhale equal to minus one and the reason I do this is

141
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,960
minus one and the reason I do this is because since X is the discrete

142
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,050
because since X is the discrete distribution I am going to calculate the

143
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,430
distribution I am going to calculate the variational approximation Qi at X equal

144
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,390
variational approximation Qi at X equal to one so with this formula William this

145
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,190
to one so with this formula William this uh normalized distribution right that's

146
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,140
uh normalized distribution right that's why you have this symbol here do you

147
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,750
why you have this symbol here do you believe that - I for example - 1 is

148
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,920
believe that - I for example - 1 is equal to really let's call this whole

149
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,030
equal to really let's call this whole summation here mi alright so this

150
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,150
summation here mi alright so this conservation work all is mi so we agreed

151
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:33,670
conservation work all is mi so we agreed that qi 4 x equals 1 is this would be 1

152
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:39,330
that qi 4 x equals 1 is this would be 1 so you need to the mi + x I equal 1 plus

153
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,670
so you need to the mi + x I equal 1 plus li plus divided by this normalization

154
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,100
li plus divided by this normalization factor

155
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,110


156
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:52,670
right okay if I write this I can do it like this

157
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,680
if I write this I can do it like this and immediately you see that this

158
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,590
and immediately you see that this traffic cycles one comes to be employed

159
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,280
traffic cycles one comes to be employed okay so that's a very nice result

160
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:07,880
okay so that's a very nice result okay and and similarly the body of july

161
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,360
okay and and similarly the body of july 4 ik cycle -1 comes to be this 2.4

162
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,770
4 ik cycle -1 comes to be this 2.4 argument - - AI for AI is this nice

163
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,960
argument - - AI for AI is this nice there appear a my that we said this

164
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,020
there appear a my that we said this distillation known because these are the

165
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,650
distillation known because these are the means of the neighbors plus 0.5 li plus

166
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:29,210
means of the neighbors plus 0.5 li plus -2 ly - also know so the main view of

167
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,520
-2 ly - also know so the main view of the discrete the various on distribution

168
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,780
the discrete the various on distribution of X I is basically pure high when X - 1

169
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,600
of X I is basically pure high when X - 1 times the volume which 1 plus this time

170
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,390
times the volume which 1 plus this time from the values minus 1 and if you such

171
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,760
from the values minus 1 and if you such gives you all of these things you get to

172
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,900
gives you all of these things you get to the mean values is dong is the hyperbola

173
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:53,360
the mean values is dong is the hyperbola target basically of AI ok also very nice

174
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,860
target basically of AI ok also very nice result and so the update formulas

175
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,030
result and so the update formulas basically if I can write verse

176
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,180
basically if I can write verse explicitly is that the mean value of

177
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,410
explicitly is that the mean value of every variable I is the hyperbolic

178
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,210
every variable I is the hyperbolic tangent of what you see inside these

179
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,840
tangent of what you see inside these parentheses obviously to update the UI

180
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,730
parentheses obviously to update the UI you need to know the mean of the

181
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,130
you need to know the mean of the neighborhood so this equation can only

182
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,800
neighborhood so this equation can only be solved

183
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,680
be solved instead constant right so you have to

184
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,100
instead constant right so you have to iterate and obviously you can do this

185
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,150
iterate and obviously you can do this with a lots of color nice tricks you can

186
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:34,070
with a lots of color nice tricks you can go through each of the pixels and repeat

187
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,350
go through each of the pixels and repeat this until basically converges or you

188
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,830
this until basically converges or you can do it even in a synchronous model ok

189
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,410
can do it even in a synchronous model ok the so the interrelations look like this

190
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,720
the so the interrelations look like this so if you put an index stick here for

191
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,850
so if you put an index stick here for the iterations you use the previous

192
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,040
the iterations you use the previous whatever values you have the update mi

193
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,230
whatever values you have the update mi and you keep going and then

194
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,560
and you keep going and then more often you will see this in if you

195
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,600
more often you will see this in if you download programs that do this you

196
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,340
download programs that do this you actually apply this equation with some

197
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,680
actually apply this equation with some relaxation so rather than using this

198
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,000
relaxation so rather than using this value for new I you use a convex sound

199
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,040
value for new I you use a convex sound basically of the previous values plus

200
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,430
basically of the previous values plus the value that is predicted to

201
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,190
the value that is predicted to variational networks okay so this is

202
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,639
variational networks okay so this is sort of way more stable and avoids a

203
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,480
sort of way more stable and avoids a number of effects but usually are common

204
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,340
number of effects but usually are common in uniting models when I try give you an

205
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,850
in uniting models when I try give you an example and the example is basically you

206
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,870
example and the example is basically you can run it it's in math crystal box do I

207
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,500
can run it it's in math crystal box do I have to do is once you install it you

208
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,660
have to do is once you install it you just with a nice thing a Mazda noise

209
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,150
just with a nice thing a Mazda noise demo and it will get your results and

210
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,490
demo and it will get your results and you can save the nice program only ten

211
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,710
you can save the nice program only ten lines that can solve this little problem

212
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:52,760
lines that can solve this little problem okay so this is you start with a noisy

213
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,100
okay so this is you start with a noisy image you know obviously you have used

214
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,870
image you know obviously you have used need to use some parameters for example

215
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,819
need to use some parameters for example this part a long time in this relaxation

216
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:04,280
this part a long time in this relaxation method that's how you know but you can

217
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,470
method that's how you know but you can see mmediately the methodologies are

218
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,240
see mmediately the methodologies are able to recognize what the actual image

219
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,170
able to recognize what the actual image is and so this is the mean of the

220
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,880
is and so this is the mean of the posterior of the violation posterior

221
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,470
posterior of the violation posterior after a number of 15 strips purity all

222
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:24,340
after a number of 15 strips purity all the pixels in the image

223
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,350


224
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,780
all right

225
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:27,790


226
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:34,710
so I'm going to be you know there is way too much material to be covered here and

227
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,300
too much material to be covered here and this is an important topic I need to be

228
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:42,060
this is an important topic I need to be sure that we discussed more or less the

229
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,260
sure that we discussed more or less the most important things

230
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,240
most important things so let me I'm going to jump on the slide

231
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,460
so let me I'm going to jump on the slide and go to slides at the age of any

232
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:52,830
and go to slides at the age of any remind me to come back to slide 31 once

233
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,880
remind me to come back to slide 31 once we're done so let me do another very

234
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,630
we're done so let me do another very simple example unless we already have

235
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,550
simple example unless we already have done it if you would do this example

236
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:08,190
done it if you would do this example with the Gaussian okay if it's the unit

237
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,380
with the Gaussian okay if it's the unit to to get out but we did it just let me

238
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,090
to to get out but we did it just let me know okay because I'm doing too much

239
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,380
know okay because I'm doing too much jumping here all right so let's suppose

240
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:21,600
jumping here all right so let's suppose we from a Gaussian but here's a

241
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,240
we from a Gaussian but here's a precision tau and a mean mu but we don't

242
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,130
precision tau and a mean mu but we don't know okay and typical vision inference

243
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,330
know okay and typical vision inference problem is to calculate the posterior of

244
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:37,110
problem is to calculate the posterior of MU and tau and again for what we have

245
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,230
MU and tau and again for what we have taken Bayesian inference cost is like

246
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,310
taken Bayesian inference cost is like the cost there is an analytical

247
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,150
the cost there is an analytical calculation basically gives you the

248
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,180
calculation basically gives you the posteriors exactly but what I want to do

249
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,180
posteriors exactly but what I want to do is I want sort of to use the variational

250
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,740
is I want sort of to use the variational method so we can see how they work and

251
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,180
method so we can see how they work and how good they do so I'm going to take

252
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:01,410
how good they do so I'm going to take the Paris Commune tau to be what's

253
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,450
the Paris Commune tau to be what's called a normal gamma distribution so

254
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,880
called a normal gamma distribution so given tau the distribution of MU is a

255
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,730
given tau the distribution of MU is a Gaussian and then for the precision of

256
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,670
Gaussian and then for the precision of comes from showing the in this

257
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,410
comes from showing the in this distribution you put a gamma

258
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:17,160
distribution you put a gamma distribution as a supplier okay so this

259
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,590
distribution as a supplier okay so this is the priors and for this priors and

260
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,910
is the priors and for this priors and it's likely with the reasonable ethical

261
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,490
it's likely with the reasonable ethical solution for the posterior we pretend we

262
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,050
solution for the posterior we pretend we don't know where our solution is we

263
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,630
don't know where our solution is we don't really care right now and what we

264
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,550
don't really care right now and what we want to do is we want to

265
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,560
want to do is we want to you know we want to calculate the

266
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,050
you know we want to calculate the variation posterior and using the mean

267
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,430
variation posterior and using the mean field approximation we're going to

268
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,040
field approximation we're going to fertilize it the joint is going to be

269
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,810
fertilize it the joint is going to be written as somebody s and distribution

270
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,390
written as somebody s and distribution Emil and somebody s in distribution of

271
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,320
Emil and somebody s in distribution of how but we immediately see that this is

272
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,750
how but we immediately see that this is going to be an approximation right

273
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,600
going to be an approximation right because for those who have looked at

274
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,780
because for those who have looked at this problem before the exact solution

275
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,120
this problem before the exact solution you expect basically if the pious look

276
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,550
you expect basically if the pious look like that this is to the exponential

277
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,990
like that this is to the exponential family the posterior is going to be on

278
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,950
family the posterior is going to be on the exponents it's going to be a

279
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,380
the exponents it's going to be a Gaussian in the ocean gamma for example

280
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,110
Gaussian in the ocean gamma for example for here tau so you expect the

281
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,880
for here tau so you expect the prosthetics for me and how to have this

282
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,850
prosthetics for me and how to have this for well in terms of mu 0 lambda 0 and

283
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,230
for well in terms of mu 0 lambda 0 and alpha 0 MV 0 you have some mu and

284
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,050
alpha 0 MV 0 you have some mu and Atlanta and an alpha N and B n for n

285
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,230
Atlanta and an alpha N and B n for n data points obviously business and state

286
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,210
data points obviously business and state in that form because the distribution of

287
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,400
in that form because the distribution of you does not involve tau so

288
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,480
you does not involve tau so approximation so it you know we need to

289
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,950
approximation so it you know we need to see you know if things make sense right

290
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,940
see you know if things make sense right obviously you are not going to do this

291
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,420
obviously you are not going to do this in reality okay but in this class

292
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:50,060
in reality okay but in this class there's no reality formula the optimal

293
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,640
there's no reality formula the optimal KJ is the expectation is where all the

294
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,640
KJ is the expectation is where all the other variables of the log of the joint

295
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,370
other variables of the log of the joint of likelihood so I am going to start

296
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,830
of likelihood so I am going to start playing with this in this calculation

297
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,620
playing with this in this calculation you need to get really understand it all

298
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,350
you need to get really understand it all right because you know if you know the

299
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,330
right because you know if you know the study you will never see you will not

300
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,100
study you will never see you will not make any sense of these derivations

301
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,520
make any sense of these derivations little children many infinite settings

302
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,680
little children many infinite settings okay so you have to work through these

303
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,000
okay so you have to work through these little problems okay so let's change we

304
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,370
little problems okay so let's change we want let's update the variation

305
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:27,050
want let's update the variation distribution for me oh okay so we're

306
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,060
distribution for me oh okay so we're gonna take expectation with respect to

307
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,940
gonna take expectation with respect to all the

308
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,680
all the varam loose there's only one or the

309
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,830
varam loose there's only one or the bottom which is tau so here the joint

310
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,399
bottom which is tau so here the joint look like we could it would be the

311
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:40,200
look like we could it would be the likelihood of the data all right which

312
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,320
likelihood of the data all right which is Gaussian and these remember disappear

313
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,310
is Gaussian and these remember disappear and there's a problem you given tau and

314
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,129
and there's a problem you given tau and prior on tau but since we are interested

315
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:55,049
prior on tau but since we are interested in the distribution of Mew

316
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:57,539
in the distribution of Mew anything that does not depend on you we

317
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,090
anything that does not depend on you we don't play with okay so the prior and

318
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,720
don't play with okay so the prior and tau is with a constant so if you expand

319
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,659
tau is with a constant so if you expand this if you're going to get something

320
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:07,950
this if you're going to get something like this right

321
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,539
like this right this ranges from you that's the only

322
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:16,830
this ranges from you that's the only time we get if we expand let you come

323
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,779
time we get if we expand let you come can somebody tell it's important if this

324
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:30,450
can somebody tell it's important if this thing have drop quiz this term target

325
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:30,460


326
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:36,139
so this came from the the likelihood there all right

327
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:39,629
there all right okay and the query is to this time

328
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:47,940
okay and the query is to this time counting from you given top okay which

329
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,680
counting from you given top okay which is Gaussian okay so and you remember the

330
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,159
is Gaussian okay so and you remember the precision of that it was lambda 0 times

331
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,919
precision of that it was lambda 0 times tau so obviously you're gonna get 1 2 0

332
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,249
tau so obviously you're gonna get 1 2 0 times tau but the Tau became expectation

333
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:05,970
times tau but the Tau became expectation of tau Y because every queries any time

334
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:11,220
of tau Y because every queries any time we need to take expectations okay

335
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,379
we need to take expectations okay and again the rest terms that depend

336
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:17,879
and again the rest terms that depend only on on the don't depend on view we

337
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:19,950
only on on the don't depend on view we don't include them okay so you look at

338
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,409
don't include them okay so you look at this nice whatever distribution do you

339
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:25,680
this nice whatever distribution do you think you will get here if you play for

340
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,690
think you will get here if you play for five minutes with this calculation I

341
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,070
five minutes with this calculation I mean we need a distribution of you know

342
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,669
mean we need a distribution of you know and I stream u square a new square and a

343
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,680
and I stream u square a new square and a linear term in una Linea Turing new plus

344
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,350
linear term in una Linea Turing new plus constant so obviously closing the square

345
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,330
constant so obviously closing the square we're gonna get a Gaussian distribution

346
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,680
we're gonna get a Gaussian distribution of this garden tradition you can so with

347
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,139
of this garden tradition you can so with zero time has this mean and has this

348
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:55,230
zero time has this mean and has this precision okay and so X is the sample

349
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,539
precision okay and so X is the sample mean basically this is for the data come

350
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:02,690
mean basically this is for the data come from this comes from the prior lambda n

351
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:06,149
from this comes from the prior lambda n involves the precision of tau in

352
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:08,519
involves the precision of tau in immediately that reminds you because we

353
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:10,289
immediately that reminds you because we don't know that the posterior but

354
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,879
don't know that the posterior but somehow we're gonna need to do

355
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:14,190
somehow we're gonna need to do iterations so basically to compute this

356
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,970
iterations so basically to compute this distribution you need to know what the

357
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,879
distribution you need to know what the mean of tau it's okay so we need to go

358
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:23,980
mean of tau it's okay so we need to go and compute off

359
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:23,990


360
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:30,980
so similarly left the power again we have big expectation with respect to all

361
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,570
have big expectation with respect to all the other variables which dearest meal

362
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:37,040
the other variables which dearest meal of the likelihood the prior of being

363
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,840
of the likelihood the prior of being given tau and the prior of power has to

364
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,760
given tau and the prior of power has to be included because we're interested of

365
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,280
be included because we're interested of the distribution of tau so this term

366
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,940
the distribution of tau so this term comes from the data likelihood so

367
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,840
comes from the data likelihood so obviously didn't be an ex-professional

368
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,410
obviously didn't be an ex-professional expecting you this comes from this so

369
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,450
expecting you this comes from this so it's going to be an expectation respect

370
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,250
it's going to be an expectation respect to meal where is this thing coming from

371
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,660
to meal where is this thing coming from one of those two terms the first two

372
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,919
one of those two terms the first two terms coming from the prior of power I

373
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,880
terms coming from the prior of power I PI of tau which is a gamma distribution

374
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:14,240
PI of tau which is a gamma distribution all right and where are those two terms

375
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:24,289
all right and where are those two terms coming from

376
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:24,299


377
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:30,919
remember when before we play with this distribution okay we only kept the terms

378
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,509
distribution okay we only kept the terms but involve me do you have to keep all

379
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:38,299
but involve me do you have to keep all the terms that involve Tao so can you

380
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:40,399
the terms that involve Tao so can you tell me where let's say there is it

381
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:49,590
tell me where let's say there is it there what is this then coming from

382
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600


383
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:57,030
so let me go back for you to remind you all everything so when a nobler to do

384
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,720
all everything so when a nobler to do with power comes from from the

385
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,360
with power comes from from the likelihood and you notice there is

386
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,040
likelihood and you notice there is another person coming from there

387
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,830
another person coming from there all right so for is it okay so we have

388
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,650
all right so for is it okay so we have this term Plus this term so effectively

389
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,930
this term Plus this term so effectively what you need to do if you look at it

390
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,990
what you need to do if you look at it carefully it is the log of the gamma

391
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,570
carefully it is the log of the gamma distribution alright so in the normal

392
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,490
distribution alright so in the normal distribution when you take logs you get

393
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,330
distribution when you take logs you get a lot of tau and a powder so that you

394
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,310
a lot of tau and a powder so that you put all the locks of tau together and

395
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,750
put all the locks of tau together and all the power terms together alright

396
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,210
all the power terms together alright what you will get is you will get a

397
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,980
what you will get is you will get a gamma distribution for this type of

398
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,620
gamma distribution for this type of alpha 0 you have our fire and instead of

399
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,120
alpha 0 you have our fire and instead of bazzill you have beta N and again here

400
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,530
bazzill you have beta N and again here you need to have expectation with

401
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:51,060
you need to have expectation with respect to MU and don't need to do all

402
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,520
respect to MU and don't need to do all of this so basically this distribution

403
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,190
of this so basically this distribution summary of everything qfm is a Gaussian

404
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,170
summary of everything qfm is a Gaussian feel power is a gamma distribution the

405
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,790
feel power is a gamma distribution the parameters are defined the way you see

406
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:07,710
parameters are defined the way you see them here you can see to define the mean

407
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,680
them here you can see to define the mean the variance of Q Prem you need to know

408
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:16,800
the variance of Q Prem you need to know the mean of tau in the ministry remember

409
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,460
the mean of tau in the ministry remember for a normal distribution which the mean

410
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,350
for a normal distribution which the mean if you have gamma distribution of the

411
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,450
if you have gamma distribution of the stop and beta would the mean anybody

412
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,870
stop and beta would the mean anybody remembers alpha divided by beta all

413
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,940
remembers alpha divided by beta all right so you can see immediately that

414
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,240
right so you can see immediately that the mean of tau depends on Alpha and

415
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:39,440
the mean of tau depends on Alpha and Beta n which again depends on moments of

416
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,730
Beta n which again depends on moments of alright so we need to know the

417
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,860
alright so we need to know the distribution of you so what you need to

418
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,040
distribution of you so what you need to do is you need to iterate ok it's like

419
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,430
do is you need to iterate ok it's like you start with somebody's vest then you

420
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:54,360
you start with somebody's vest then you compute gamma then you find the moments

421
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,070
compute gamma then you find the moments you know whatever that the expectation

422
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,530
you know whatever that the expectation of star

423
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:59,170
of star you go back you to calculators keep

424
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,600
you go back you to calculators keep going i fiddle basically convert sense

425
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,320
going i fiddle basically convert sense and and here is sort of a little example

426
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,540
and and here is sort of a little example I don't know yes so there is a Python

427
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:14,820
I don't know yes so there is a Python code written by the promise didn't again

428
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,250
code written by the promise didn't again but you can download and I think I you

429
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,140
but you can download and I think I you know this link is corrected but some of

430
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,660
know this link is corrected but some of the links I need to double check that

431
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:30,040
the links I need to double check that they're making sense so okay so this is

432
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,570
they're making sense so okay so this is one of the estimation of this cube meal

433
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,820
one of the estimation of this cube meal with cue update if you update your power

434
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,070
with cue update if you update your power and then when it converges in the

435
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,870
and then when it converges in the process is the actual distribution that

436
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:46,060
process is the actual distribution that history with this I am assuming red or

437
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,630
history with this I am assuming red or green care okay alright so this again

438
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,300
green care okay alright so this again it's a female example by we know the

439
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,220
it's a female example by we know the analytical solution but if you think

440
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,440
analytical solution but if you think about it you know the test of greenness

441
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,420
about it you know the test of greenness calculation is trivial and but you know

442
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,620
calculation is trivial and but you know if the reason is the solution

443
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,710
if the reason is the solution unfortunately you cannot go by but using

444
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,560
unfortunately you cannot go by but using only the analytical solution and if

445
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,090
only the analytical solution and if there is an analytical solution you

446
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,410
there is an analytical solution you pretend you don't really know that's

447
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,660
pretend you don't really know that's very bad for you like actually you need

448
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,150
very bad for you like actually you need to know okay but this problem with is

449
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:22,659
to know okay but this problem with is sort of exit exit exit ops okay

450
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:22,669


451
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:31,200
right

452
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,210


453
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:37,500
in sorry I want to make a position that I'm gonna repeat for other prompts as

454
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:43,350
I'm gonna repeat for other prompts as well right when you remember we we when

455
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,870
well right when you remember we we when we started the variational methods right

456
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,770
we started the variational methods right we solve that we define what's going to

457
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,520
we solve that we define what's going to know about all right and this was amount

458
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,360
know about all right and this was amount to what the entity to the right legal

459
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,190
to what the entity to the right legal effects okay one of the things you need

460
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,780
effects okay one of the things you need to do when you're I this Court's right

461
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,460
to do when you're I this Court's right is to sexually complete the lower bound

462
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,720
is to sexually complete the lower bound because the objective invariants are

463
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,520
because the objective invariants are inferences to do what you want to much

464
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,920
inferences to do what you want to much tomorrow is the log-likelihood right and

465
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,060
tomorrow is the log-likelihood right and because you don't need too much to my

466
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,940
because you don't need too much to my eyes well below bow so you know you

467
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,340
eyes well below bow so you know you really have no choice but to compute a

468
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,070
really have no choice but to compute a lot of also in other ways if you do all

469
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,990
lot of also in other ways if you do all of the situation's right you go from one

470
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:34,620
of the situation's right you go from one iteration to another this question is

471
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,300
iteration to another this question is can you show me for no amount actually

472
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,030
can you show me for no amount actually increases during iterations because if

473
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,010
increases during iterations because if it does then whatever interests is you

474
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,640
it does then whatever interests is you do it's magic is not science you need to

475
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,590
do it's magic is not science you need to show that the lower body continuously

476
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,220
show that the lower body continuously increases okay so we need to compute the

477
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,330
increases okay so we need to compute the lower now that's the standard

478
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,700
lower now that's the standard calculation you have to do in this

479
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,950
calculation you have to do in this approximate variational method so let's

480
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,090
approximate variational method so let's try to do the lower bound for the simple

481
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,880
try to do the lower bound for the simple case of the Gaussian so I'm going to

482
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,940
case of the Gaussian so I'm going to remind you the calculation it's also bad

483
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,220
remind you the calculation it's also bad but its standard it will do it two or

484
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,960
but its standard it will do it two or three or four problems you will be able

485
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,140
three or four problems you will be able to actually do this in research related

486
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,400
to actually do this in research related problems in machine learning

487
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,810
problems in machine learning okay so the I remind you it's the

488
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,310
okay so the I remind you it's the expectation with respect to the

489
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,370
expectation with respect to the variational distribution to guarantee

490
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:27,360
variational distribution to guarantee which we factorize it and of the log of

491
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,000
which we factorize it and of the log of the joint initiative hood and I wrote it

492
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,820
the joint initiative hood and I wrote it here explicitly this is my date of the

493
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,790
here explicitly this is my date of the MU and power divided by the variance

494
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,490
MU and power divided by the variance the tradition and then I mean how is the

495
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,150
the tradition and then I mean how is the great power

496
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,710
great power alright this is the definition we use

497
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:46,250
alright this is the definition we use that's a little bomb so to exceed this

498
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:52,250
that's a little bomb so to exceed this alright so I'm going to make this Q and

499
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,480
alright so I'm going to make this Q and substituted with expectation of the

500
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,310
substituted with expectation of the arguments right this is the expectation

501
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:59,340
arguments right this is the expectation of Islam with respect to this variation

502
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,070
of Islam with respect to this variation distribution Q so that's what II refers

503
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:07,320
distribution Q so that's what II refers here so I have the expectation of the

504
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,780
here so I have the expectation of the log of the numerator which I can write

505
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,490
log of the numerator which I can write it the log of the likes we've given the

506
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:15,300
it the log of the likes we've given the parameters and then I have the prior log

507
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,930
parameters and then I have the prior log of the prior given tower level of the

508
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:23,150
of the prior given tower level of the prior power you see that this counts by

509
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,590
prior power you see that this counts by writing this as the life of the time

510
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,930
writing this as the life of the time supplier

511
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,580
supplier all right nothing else and then Bill

512
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,760
all right nothing else and then Bill denominator because this is factorize I

513
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,260
denominator because this is factorize I have expectations and all these

514
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:39,330
have expectations and all these expectations of the law of pure fair and

515
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:43,380
expectations of the law of pure fair and a lot of rooftop really all right so if

516
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,800
a lot of rooftop really all right so if you need to do you need to go and and

517
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,760
you need to do you need to go and and compute all of the steps okay it makes a

518
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,790
compute all of the steps okay it makes a massive task and this is only a

519
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,590
massive task and this is only a univariate gaussians so you should be

520
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,800
univariate gaussians so you should be able to to live with it okay so let's

521
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,720
able to to live with it okay so let's see let's pick up the easy terms if you

522
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,630
see let's pick up the easy terms if you take one more fuel and what type of

523
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:13,379
take one more fuel and what type of distribution self you feminists

524
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:13,389


525
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:17,730
it came to be a Gaussian viscount's and clear right so when you have the

526
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:20,279
clear right so when you have the expected obviously there is not here

527
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:23,009
expected obviously there is not here alright so the expectation was with

528
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:24,600
alright so the expectation was with respect to me on power but this now

529
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,940
respect to me on power but this now becomes expectation expecting you so

530
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,580
becomes expectation expecting you so leave me what you have here is nothing

531
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,749
leave me what you have here is nothing else not the entropy of this Gaussian

532
00:31:33,749 --> 00:31:35,549
else not the entropy of this Gaussian distribution so you can look in

533
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:38,279
distribution so you can look in Wikipedia and say entropy list there's

534
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:44,820
Wikipedia and say entropy list there's the answer okay alright so this is the

535
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:52,710
the answer okay alright so this is the entropy of QP would be the entropy of

536
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,409
entropy of QP would be the entropy of the gamma distribution you can again

537
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:59,060
the gamma distribution you can again look at Wikipedia 75 minutes when I

538
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,950
look at Wikipedia 75 minutes when I check these things right there is

539
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:06,779
check these things right there is information everywhere around you in

540
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:08,190
information everywhere around you in case you don't remember this is what's

541
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,869
case you don't remember this is what's called the my gamma distribution that

542
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:14,369
called the my gamma distribution that appears in the gamma distribution sin it

543
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:19,710
appears in the gamma distribution sin it also appears in the distribution so this

544
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,269
also appears in the distribution so this is it so this is the by gamma

545
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:23,789
is it so this is the by gamma distribution okay I'm not gonna tell you

546
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:27,840
distribution okay I'm not gonna tell you what it is you can look and I trust

547
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:38,249
what it is you can look and I trust there is a link there of India and they

548
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:41,909
there is a link there of India and they were not really computers there was no

549
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:43,740
were not really computers there was no Wikipedia there were no books they were

550
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,669
Wikipedia there were no books they were not PDFs of Chinese origin or anything

551
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:50,730
not PDFs of Chinese origin or anything like that everything was nice and clean

552
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,009
like that everything was nice and clean some with some library and you have to

553
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:54,659
some with some library and you have to go and spend five hours to locate it in

554
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:56,669
go and spend five hours to locate it in a library here are you know two minutes

555
00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:00,629
a library here are you know two minutes where it is alright but obviously you're

556
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:04,139
where it is alright but obviously you're given something immediately means the

557
00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:05,759
given something immediately means the expectations that you do something with

558
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:08,909
expectations that you do something with other are higher all right because this

559
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:12,090
other are higher all right because this information area you need to do user

560
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,690
information area you need to do user information no excuses for not

561
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:20,810
information no excuses for not fixed all right so complicated terms we

562
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,960
fixed all right so complicated terms we need now the expectation of the logo PI

563
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,419
need now the expectation of the logo PI of T with respect to Q of T so I keep

564
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:31,849
of T with respect to Q of T so I keep the expectation outside I'm expanding

565
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:35,210
the expectation outside I'm expanding the log of gamma distribution so there

566
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,580
the log of gamma distribution so there is nothing here bizarre from the

567
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,759
is nothing here bizarre from the normalization terms okay

568
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:44,570
normalization terms okay this comes from you know remember the

569
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,549
this comes from you know remember the gamma distribution is tower 12 plus 0

570
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:51,080
gamma distribution is tower 12 plus 0 minus 1 tau 2 minus B you got 2 minus

571
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,149
minus 1 tau 2 minus B you got 2 minus beta 0 right or biggest deal to minus

572
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:58,999
beta 0 right or biggest deal to minus tau which was it yeah okay something

573
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:03,700
tau which was it yeah okay something something you know something like that

574
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:09,169
something you know something like that okay so okay so let me see there must be

575
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:11,780
okay so okay so let me see there must be a missing term here so I need to dig

576
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,700
a missing term here so I need to dig expectations this with respect to Q P

577
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:18,980
expectations this with respect to Q P okay and this term is constant this term

578
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,000
okay and this term is constant this term is constant

579
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,309
is constant okay what we need to do now is you need

580
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:24,789
okay what we need to do now is you need the expectation of the longest power

581
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:27,829
the expectation of the longest power with respect to Q tau and cube time is

582
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:31,539
with respect to Q tau and cube time is for distribution is gamma surprised

583
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:34,339
for distribution is gamma surprised there's a very famous formula becomes

584
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:36,169
there's a very famous formula becomes very often actually in machine learning

585
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:38,510
very often actually in machine learning it's not as a gamma distribution we have

586
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,129
it's not as a gamma distribution we have expectations with respect to the gamma

587
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:45,200
expectations with respect to the gamma distribution of the love of tau the

588
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,520
distribution of the love of tau the result is the by gamma distribution

589
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,589
result is the by gamma distribution calculated on so if the Nama

590
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,569
calculated on so if the Nama distribution starts a and B so this

591
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:56,109
distribution starts a and B so this triangle trace of a minus log of theta

592
00:34:56,109 --> 00:35:00,020
triangle trace of a minus log of theta okay and some course you need to compute

593
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,539
okay and some course you need to compute the mean of a gamma distribution which

594
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:05,270
the mean of a gamma distribution which is a over beta so basically you're done

595
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,329
is a over beta so basically you're done with this term as well this is premium

596
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:10,220
with this term as well this is premium because this Gaussian

597
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,090
because this Gaussian this is Gaussian so

598
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,130
this is Gaussian so I am just giving you the results that

599
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,010
I am just giving you the results that you expose okay

600
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,830
you expose okay and you yours the sufficient statistics

601
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,440
and you yours the sufficient statistics of the day to simplify you get this nice

602
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,640
of the day to simplify you get this nice results stimulus for this is a Gaussian

603
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,460
results stimulus for this is a Gaussian okay you expand and this is the final

604
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,560
okay you expand and this is the final formula okay

605
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,690
formula okay it looks very complicated and you may

606
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,180
it looks very complicated and you may ask me I'm like so kind to you putting

607
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,950
ask me I'm like so kind to you putting all these things in different colors no

608
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,840
all these things in different colors no you know why I put them in colors

609
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,210
you know why I put them in colors because when I was deriving this I keep

610
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,850
because when I was deriving this I keep doing mistakes so I wanted to know that

611
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,650
doing mistakes so I wanted to know that combines with what so I will bring it

612
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,650
combines with what so I will bring it for myself because you know this is the

613
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,140
for myself because you know this is the only way I can learn all right now if

614
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,660
only way I can learn all right now if you want to take advance of the course -

615
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,940
you want to take advance of the course - and if together why they work there okay

616
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,040
and if together why they work there okay so this time something would be the same

617
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,200
so this time something would be the same color combined and when you're finished

618
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,920
color combined and when you're finished if you get let me see if there is a you

619
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,630
if you get let me see if there is a you did actually an extremely trivial

620
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,780
did actually an extremely trivial formula okay I'm surprised myself

621
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,800
formula okay I'm surprised myself - obviously lots of cancellations the

622
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,280
- obviously lots of cancellations the loan amount is - well half of ll of long

623
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,610
loan amount is - well half of ll of long tenure okay Plus local programmer

624
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,460
tenure okay Plus local programmer function computer the N minus a and log

625
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,430
function computer the N minus a and log of BN and I remind you this a N and B

626
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,220
of BN and I remind you this a N and B else we defined them when we computed

627
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,260
else we defined them when we computed the variational distributions so

628
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,810
the variational distributions so basically L of Q it's all kind of a

629
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,720
basically L of Q it's all kind of a formula so what you need to do is as you

630
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,670
formula so what you need to do is as you update these lambdas and alphas and

631
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,500
update these lambdas and alphas and betas in the two bodies and

632
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,840
betas in the two bodies and distributions you actually have to plot

633
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,000
distributions you actually have to plot this out - and disturb that is

634
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,570
this out - and disturb that is monotonically increasing if it is not

635
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,930
monotonically increasing if it is not either

636
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,230
either the calculation of the the distributions

637
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,540
the calculation of the the distributions is wrong or basically your calculations

638
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:03,610
is wrong or basically your calculations of the lower bound is incorrect okay

639
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:03,620


640
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:10,090
this is very essential you have to do this in every problem

641
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:10,100


642
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:20,240
well I'd solution since we talked about for the single Gaussian about computing

643
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,940
for the single Gaussian about computing the lower bound right to say that we

644
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,400
the lower bound right to say that we optimized properly let's discuss her a

645
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:31,130
optimized properly let's discuss her a bit rational influenced many variation

646
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,380
bit rational influenced many variation of box missions in the context of model

647
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,610
of box missions in the context of model selection of a belief in in this case I

648
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:40,460
selection of a belief in in this case I am not at all about model selection but

649
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,170
am not at all about model selection but we spend a lot of times

650
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:46,610
we spend a lot of times lots of lectures on in the fall to

651
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,530
lots of lectures on in the fall to discuss about model selection so the

652
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,990
discuss about model selection so the idea here is you know you may have

653
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,750
idea here is you know you may have different models that you label them

654
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,120
different models that you label them with them all right maybe you put some

655
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,730
with them all right maybe you put some Flyers of this models and you have some

656
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,410
Flyers of this models and you have some date and you want to figure out what is

657
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,300
date and you want to figure out what is the best model all right what's the best

658
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,940
the best model all right what's the best model so the question is can you

659
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,980
model so the question is can you actually use variation optimization

660
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,210
actually use variation optimization variation our interest to find the best

661
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:17,480
variation our interest to find the best model so in principle what I'm asking is

662
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,800
model so in principle what I'm asking is will be possible

663
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,780
will be possible let's say you start with some prior that

664
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,820
let's say you start with some prior that this given the telling formative you put

665
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,070
this given the telling formative you put the same probability in all the models

666
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,010
the same probability in all the models can you calculate gears from data a

667
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,950
can you calculate gears from data a variation of posterior of M where m is a

668
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,850
variation of posterior of M where m is a model so let's have models you know

669
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,280
model so let's have models you know what's the best model right and we will

670
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,990
what's the best model right and we will do this you know in the context of

671
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,780
do this you know in the context of regression I think possibly today all

672
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,940
regression I think possibly today all right but I wanted to do sort of a very

673
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,830
right but I wanted to do sort of a very feeble calculation to see the

674
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,980
feeble calculation to see the variational calculations can actually be

675
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,580
variational calculations can actually be used to compute the posterior of that

676
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:57,650
used to compute the posterior of that okay so so basically we're looking here

677
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,800
okay so so basically we're looking here is if we have some data X right can we

678
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,210
is if we have some data X right can we calculate the posterior of the mountain

679
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:08,780
calculate the posterior of the mountain the beta example affirmative say it's

680
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,180
the beta example affirmative say it's regression may be negative equal to 1/s

681
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,609
regression may be negative equal to 1/s you use linear concepts maybe different

682
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:16,740
you use linear concepts maybe different person use quadratic functions model

683
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,430
person use quadratic functions model equal three cubic functions or maybe you

684
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,440
equal three cubic functions or maybe you know more than one is you use one basis

685
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,510
know more than one is you use one basis function or the to two basis functions

686
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,490
function or the to two basis functions three based processes which man who does

687
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:37,320
three based processes which man who does the best all right but you have to sit

688
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,270
the best all right but you have to sit for money how these calculations come in

689
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,820
for money how these calculations come in the context of this variational method

690
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,270
the context of this variational method so we'll do some simple trivial nothing

691
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,690
so we'll do some simple trivial nothing sophisticated yet so wanna do is let's

692
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,210
sophisticated yet so wanna do is let's say that every model has its own local

693
00:39:51,210 --> 00:40:00,500
say that every model has its own local variables

694
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:00,510


695
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:07,200
so you know so when I try to define a variation approximation of the posterior

696
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,480
variation approximation of the posterior of znm I am gonna write it as follows

697
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,070
of znm I am gonna write it as follows somebody a tional distribution of Z

698
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:18,120
somebody a tional distribution of Z given M so this is an approximation the

699
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,980
given M so this is an approximation the posterior of the super hyper score model

700
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,720
posterior of the super hyper score model M times the posterior on the left

701
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:32,790
M times the posterior on the left alright so nothing so some calculations

702
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:36,329
alright so nothing so some calculations here to see how this whole thing's come

703
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:38,270
here to see how this whole thing's come to the others are approximation to the

704
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,730
to the others are approximation to the low black we would without any

705
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,770
low black we would without any discussion of model terror all right so

706
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,510
discussion of model terror all right so what I have done is I give the

707
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,920
what I have done is I give the definition of the lower bound

708
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,589
definition of the lower bound alright and then I suppose you remember

709
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:54,450
alright and then I suppose you remember what the expectation with respect to the

710
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,490
what the expectation with respect to the latent power also in this case the

711
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,829
latent power also in this case the latent variables really CNN they are

712
00:40:58,829 --> 00:40:59,910
latent variables really CNN they are both unknowns

713
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:03,839
both unknowns okay and I put the posterior this is my

714
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,329
okay and I put the posterior this is my approximate posterior this is the

715
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:08,940
approximate posterior this is the expectation part and then I have the log

716
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,310
expectation part and then I have the log the joint look likelihood noticed a

717
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,650
the joint look likelihood noticed a little active with this my vapors

718
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:18,960
little active with this my vapors detects my ZN my model because I how

719
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,730
detects my ZN my model because I how does that have put the motive to be and

720
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:25,680
does that have put the motive to be and I know this is basically about models

721
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,530
I know this is basically about models okay and then of the denominator

722
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,180
okay and then of the denominator obviously have the same foreign

723
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,990
obviously have the same foreign distribution so you can write the same

724
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,710
distribution so you can write the same as before so here what I do is I write

725
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:40,950
as before so here what I do is I write the exact post fear of ZN m given the

726
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:45,360
the exact post fear of ZN m given the data times few effects and this like

727
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:50,790
data times few effects and this like that okay and and in this last line with

728
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:53,460
that okay and and in this last line with like this I take this P effects and I

729
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,320
like this I take this P effects and I remove it out because doesn't depend on

730
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,650
remove it out because doesn't depend on M and D respectively what I get is this

731
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,440
M and D respectively what I get is this nice thing plus log of P of X and you

732
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,940
nice thing plus log of P of X and you probably might if you love of the

733
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,400
probably might if you love of the effects is basically the lower bound

734
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,110
effects is basically the lower bound - this okay does this remind you

735
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,890
- this okay does this remind you anything what is remember the one we

736
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,620
anything what is remember the one we have the fundamental identity that the

737
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,750
have the fundamental identity that the log likelihood is different the lower

738
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,140
log likelihood is different the lower bound and Wiggins was there became of

739
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,700
bound and Wiggins was there became of dimensions the only difference here is

740
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,730
dimensions the only difference here is instead of a sphere of Z I have the

741
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:31,260
instead of a sphere of Z I have the proof CNN right solution has changed

742
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:35,610
proof CNN right solution has changed okay very much imperative to tell you on

743
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,380
okay very much imperative to tell you on how you compute for your friends so

744
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,850
how you compute for your friends so let's see what we can do this so long

745
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:46,770
let's see what we can do this so long ado this is let's say you can maybe go

746
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:49,170
ado this is let's say you can maybe go in addition approximations on each model

747
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,420
in addition approximations on each model and if you can then calculate

748
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,540
and if you can then calculate below the bar for its problem so L M is

749
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,970
below the bar for its problem so L M is the lower bathroom of the length and I

750
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:00,720
the lower bathroom of the length and I write it like that everybody agrees I

751
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,430
write it like that everybody agrees I mean you can see here what is that is

752
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:07,410
mean you can see here what is that is the joint alive you could form on the

753
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:10,290
the joint alive you could form on the level there's nothing fancy

754
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,760
level there's nothing fancy okay my conditioner to your embassy

755
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,790
okay my conditioner to your embassy right so the question is once I have

756
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:18,070
right so the question is once I have this can I come up with a novel lower

757
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,950
this can I come up with a novel lower bound basically for my whole problem for

758
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:22,600
bound basically for my whole problem for mothers have been integrate doubt so

759
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,340
mothers have been integrate doubt so let's see how the calculation looks like

760
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,410
let's see how the calculation looks like it's actually very interesting in Sabra

761
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:31,480
it's actually very interesting in Sabra this is what we started before all right

762
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,120
this is what we started before all right this is having a variation of

763
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,010
this is having a variation of distribution models and all disease for

764
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:40,600
distribution models and all disease for each model so what I do is I write the

765
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,720
each model so what I do is I write the actual join of lack of it here as the

766
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,450
actual join of lack of it here as the probability of Z and X given M plus the

767
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,760
probability of Z and X given M plus the prior of them all right and then on the

768
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,240
prior of them all right and then on the denominator I have minus log of Q of Z M

769
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,510
denominator I have minus log of Q of Z M and if you alright

770
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:02,440
and if you alright I let's see I shake here I'm going to

771
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,380
I let's see I shake here I'm going to put two of them outside okay

772
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,360
put two of them outside okay so cute n goes to the whole thing so I'm

773
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,000
so cute n goes to the whole thing so I'm going to put Q of em outside so I have P

774
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,280
going to put Q of em outside so I have P of M and then of p.m. nice Ln of QM nice

775
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,330
of M and then of p.m. nice Ln of QM nice I have obviously the summation of M will

776
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:21,670
I have obviously the summation of M will been outside then I have a summation on

777
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:27,430
been outside then I have a summation on Z and this thing right depends on G so

778
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,920
Z and this thing right depends on G so I'm going to have cube CM and then of P

779
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,040
I'm going to have cube CM and then of P of Z comma X given them and we have this

780
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,740
of Z comma X given them and we have this curve as well will you agree the fiscal

781
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:39,510
curve as well will you agree the fiscal think it is really ll compelling to God

782
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,430
think it is really ll compelling to God is it

783
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:46,059
is it it is right all right sorry I'm writing

784
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,549
it is right all right sorry I'm writing this whole thing then qfm love of

785
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:51,640
this whole thing then qfm love of theater - love of children and I should

786
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,849
theater - love of children and I should have LM so if I did this love of it -

787
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:59,920
have LM so if I did this love of it - the 11 right nothing spectacular there's

788
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,839
the 11 right nothing spectacular there's a reason for this I arrived it like that

789
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,539
a reason for this I arrived it like that because then I can write this whole the

790
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:07,059
because then I can write this whole the overall lower bound I can write this

791
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:13,829
overall lower bound I can write this ship m ln of pfm times C to the LM / q /

792
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:16,329
ship m ln of pfm times C to the LM / q / and so look at this nice now the

793
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:18,609
and so look at this nice now the relation of the lower bounds and tell me

794
00:45:18,609 --> 00:45:24,400
relation of the lower bounds and tell me what is this nice quantity now that that

795
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:35,579
what is this nice quantity now that that remind you by definition

796
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:35,589


797
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:39,910
come on I Sakura Sakura Venice is something

798
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:42,970
I Sakura Sakura Venice is something there it doesn't have to remind you this

799
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:45,280
there it doesn't have to remind you this question today was something we have

800
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,930
question today was something we have mentioned maybe something would have not

801
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:53,250
mentioned maybe something would have not mentioned but what is this by definition

802
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:53,260


803
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:57,970
the work

804
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:57,980


805
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:04,980
I'm here thank you remember noise filtering and it's a nonlinear filtering

806
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,980
filtering and it's a nonlinear filtering all right so what is that entity is -

807
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:16,620
all right so what is that entity is - the word

808
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,630


809
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:20,610
now it looks like an expectation but there is a better definition of what is

810
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,000
there is a better definition of what is this is - I gave you half of the story -

811
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,570
this is - I gave you half of the story - out of the KL divergence between Q and P

812
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:36,270
out of the KL divergence between Q and P of 10 times e to the 11 all right so the

813
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,480
of 10 times e to the 11 all right so the objective is to maximize the overall

814
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,490
objective is to maximize the overall lower bound then you have to minimize

815
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:43,500


816
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:51,240
this and we know the exact answer right this will be optimised when qfm equal to

817
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,690
this will be optimised when qfm equal to PM e to the LM where the ram is equal

818
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,360
PM e to the LM where the ram is equal like that so really now for the first

819
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,330
like that so really now for the first time you no need to slide you have seen

820
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:03,870
time you no need to slide you have seen a variational posterior of a model in

821
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:12,450
a variational posterior of a model in two slides okay so you can I mean this

822
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:15,090
two slides okay so you can I mean this can be extremely useful if you want to

823
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,700
can be extremely useful if you want to do model selection in regression

824
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:25,770
do model selection in regression classification just mention it which

825
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:28,200
classification just mention it which model does the best alright so this

826
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,970
model does the best alright so this gives you an approximation give it the

827
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:32,730
gives you an approximation give it the data of the posterior over models and if

828
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:36,150
data of the posterior over models and if you plot this for model 1 2 &amp; 3 etc you

829
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:39,180
you plot this for model 1 2 &amp; 3 etc you know you will eventually be able to do

830
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,770
know you will eventually be able to do model selection figure out what's the

831
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:43,230
model selection figure out what's the best model that interprets the data okay

832
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:48,390
best model that interprets the data okay so this is a very nice calculation using

833
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,250
so this is a very nice calculation using variational methods of expense basically

834
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:54,510
variational methods of expense basically this concept for computing distribution

835
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:56,430
this concept for computing distribution of related variables now computing

836
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:58,800
of related variables now computing distributions over latent variables and

837
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,730
distributions over latent variables and models

838
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:06,900
models alright so very nice

839
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:06,910


840
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:13,170
so

841
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:13,180


842
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:20,370
the 1990 pastula so they decide on this actually where I can if there is a new

843
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:22,410
actually where I can if there is a new tactic that's a little bit more

844
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:26,430
tactic that's a little bit more complicated than the topics to come but

845
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,490
complicated than the topics to come but because I need somehow put them together

846
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:36,000
because I need somehow put them together let me let me finish it up right and try

847
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:47,760
let me let me finish it up right and try to do our best to understand it again

848
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,039
to do our best to understand it again this will be by Sheriff Tom it's a bit

849
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:52,289
this will be by Sheriff Tom it's a bit more difficult than some of the problems

850
00:48:52,289 --> 00:48:54,870
more difficult than some of the problems we will see next but let's get get out

851
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:58,200
we will see next but let's get get out of the way okay well first what the

852
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,329
of the way okay well first what the macaronis is about so what you see here

853
00:49:00,329 --> 00:49:07,609
macaronis is about so what you see here is a model where you know I mean it

854
00:49:07,609 --> 00:49:10,019
is a model where you know I mean it snows here in earlier lectures the

855
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:11,970
snows here in earlier lectures the difference from what we discussed in

856
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:15,329
difference from what we discussed in most of the presentations from hmm is

857
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:18,839
most of the presentations from hmm is but we have multiple chains but they're

858
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:20,130
but we have multiple chains but they're linked together and they're linked

859
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,019
linked together and they're linked together as you can see because the

860
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:24,299
together as you can see because the observations of every time dependent on

861
00:49:24,299 --> 00:49:29,460
observations of every time dependent on the state of all the change okay so if

862
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,650
the state of all the change okay so if you try to actually messaging and you

863
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:37,380
you try to actually messaging and you know the cell phone data messages to do

864
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,660
know the cell phone data messages to do it because the chains are coupled okay

865
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,779
it because the chains are coupled okay the list would be a serious limitation

866
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,940
the list would be a serious limitation of the things we learned in the context

867
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,549
of the things we learned in the context of what's called proctorial hidden

868
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:51,779
of what's called proctorial hidden Markov models okay so then I don't

869
00:49:51,779 --> 00:49:54,569
Markov models okay so then I don't highlight basically today it can somehow

870
00:49:54,569 --> 00:49:57,690
highlight basically today it can somehow reduce some ideas from variational

871
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:01,829
reduce some ideas from variational method and the star approximation of the

872
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:04,289
method and the star approximation of the posterior of this stage of the different

873
00:50:04,289 --> 00:50:06,809
posterior of this stage of the different change in a way that somehow uncouples

874
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:09,470
change in a way that somehow uncouples them in

875
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:12,700
them in in a manner that somehow allow us to use

876
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,530
in a manner that somehow allow us to use forward my first Masters propagation the

877
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:18,080
forward my first Masters propagation the way we have seen it for one chain in the

878
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,440
way we have seen it for one chain in the past or you know for independent text so

879
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,000
past or you know for independent text so let's determine deed to see if Malaysia

880
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,580
let's determine deed to see if Malaysia Metis actually are any views on this

881
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,240
Metis actually are any views on this problem

882
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,340
problem I mean violation weapons we will see

883
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,830
I mean violation weapons we will see there of use for everything okay the

884
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:35,920
there of use for everything okay the approximate method for everything first

885
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:41,240
approximate method for everything first example if you can think here my

886
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,240
example if you can think here my syllabus is really act alright this is

887
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,330
syllabus is really act alright this is the unknown states the data why you can

888
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:53,480
the unknown states the data why you can stick here much so if the joining

889
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,930
stick here much so if the joining likelihood is basically my transition

890
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,870
likelihood is basically my transition model from t minus one two three okay

891
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:04,040
model from t minus one two three okay and the observation model okay and you

892
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,690
and the observation model okay and you notice there is a copy here and I'm

893
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:06,980
notice there is a copy here and I'm gonna show you here explicitly because

894
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,330
gonna show you here explicitly because why P depends on the axis of all these

895
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:16,930
why P depends on the axis of all these state X M alright and this the profit

896
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:20,450
state X M alright and this the profit the Jane looked like I mean John like

897
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,640
the Jane looked like I mean John like liquids a product over the change and

898
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,220
liquids a product over the change and all the time instances teeth okay so the

899
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,560
all the time instances teeth okay so the definition is very very similar to what

900
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,020
definition is very very similar to what we have seen from the exact logs on a

901
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,730
we have seen from the exact logs on a log likelihood that we have seen the

902
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:37,040
log likelihood that we have seen the trap so a we give a for the

903
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,890
trap so a we give a for the transition matrix we have some

904
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,320
transition matrix we have some probabilities for the initial space

905
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,150
probabilities for the initial space which is better from what we have done

906
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:48,350
which is better from what we have done before years but there is an index well

907
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:50,660
before years but there is an index well there is a named exam because this

908
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,520
there is a named exam because this transition probabilities and initial

909
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,680
transition probabilities and initial probabilities have to refer to its chain

910
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:02,060
probabilities have to refer to its chain K from k 1 to M okay so the likelihood

911
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,520
K from k 1 to M okay so the likelihood model this is departure from what we

912
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,420
model this is departure from what we have done in the hmm presentations it is

913
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:12,770
have done in the hmm presentations it is now the moon is defined to be estimation

914
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:15,440
now the moon is defined to be estimation of the

915
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,780
of the raishin basically a linear weighted sum

916
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:21,860
raishin basically a linear weighted sum of the states at this time and the

917
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,110
of the states at this time and the coefficients here we take them to be

918
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:27,530
coefficients here we take them to be given to start with okay so the mean is

919
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:30,230
given to start with okay so the mean is given some linear interpolation between

920
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,290
given some linear interpolation between the values of X's all the change

921
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:37,430
the values of X's all the change mm remember me from little n equal to R

922
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:42,380
mm remember me from little n equal to R to capital M okay so this is alright and

923
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,480
to capital M okay so this is alright and it's computationally very difficult to

924
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,150
it's computationally very difficult to work with because of this equation so

925
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:50,450
work with because of this equation so this equation constraint so you won't be

926
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:53,810
this equation constraint so you won't be able you know if you do expectation

927
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:56,090
able you know if you do expectation maximization for example and compute the

928
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,130
maximization for example and compute the sufficient statistic you won't be able

929
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:00,500
sufficient statistic you won't be able to use for the backward message passing

930
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:05,480
to use for the backward message passing because these messages are coupled so it

931
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:11,240
because these messages are coupled so it will be computationally very big okay so

932
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,380
will be computationally very big okay so I am I think the exact posterior

933
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,410
I am I think the exact posterior basically using the exact joint local

934
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:21,410
basically using the exact joint local article so expanding it basically this

935
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:26,030
article so expanding it basically this is the name of the probability value

936
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,040
is the name of the probability value shown in the previous slide so this

937
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,900
shown in the previous slide so this comes from the data likelihood that's

938
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,540
comes from the data likelihood that's for the coupling is okay it's a Gaussian

939
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:37,010
for the coupling is okay it's a Gaussian and we have thinking lungs so this

940
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:39,500
and we have thinking lungs so this vector here is the log of the

941
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,050
vector here is the log of the probabilities of the initial States for

942
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:46,670
probabilities of the initial States for its chain m and this is the launch of

943
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:48,140
its chain m and this is the launch of the transition probabilities for each

944
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:52,310
the transition probabilities for each state and there is really nothing near

945
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:54,770
state and there is really nothing near from what we discussed with hmm except

946
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:56,840
from what we discussed with hmm except the fact now that I have instead of

947
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,000
the fact now that I have instead of having one chain I have a summation of

948
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,430
having one chain I have a summation of each state of all the change with their

949
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:04,070
each state of all the change with their own profit initial probabilities and in

950
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,720
own profit initial probabilities and in the transitions have another summation

951
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,490
the transitions have another summation then for all the transition

952
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,310
then for all the transition probabilities right so we need to find

953
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,680
probabilities right so we need to find some way to

954
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,380
some way to just approximate inference to solve this

955
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:22,400
just approximate inference to solve this problem okay and the idea is the

956
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,099
problem okay and the idea is the difference like the world is approximate

957
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:27,200
difference like the world is approximate so miss can you have to use your

958
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,720
so miss can you have to use your intuition or you say I'm gonna try

959
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,760
intuition or you say I'm gonna try something that looks like that and let's

960
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,510
something that looks like that and let's hope for the best

961
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:36,200
hope for the best all right so the situation we will

962
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,520
all right so the situation we will discuss is an approximation that will

963
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:45,260
discuss is an approximation that will decouple the change okay so somehow we

964
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:50,059
decouple the change okay so somehow we decouple them so that way we can become

965
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:53,319
decouple them so that way we can become messages back and forth basically change

966
00:54:53,319 --> 00:54:56,960
messages back and forth basically change independently now to the couple of them

967
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,640
independently now to the couple of them let me just tell you what the idea is

968
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:11,390
let me just tell you what the idea is obviously so if we try to approximate

969
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:14,240
obviously so if we try to approximate them it's independent can you imagine in

970
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,400
them it's independent can you imagine in the context of maintained approximations

971
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,760
the context of maintained approximations something we need to do to get rid of

972
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,370
something we need to do to get rid of this term here this is the evidence for

973
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:24,170
this term here this is the evidence for typos everything together

974
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:29,710
typos everything together can you think of some sort of you know

975
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:36,950
can you think of some sort of you know idea with a backward message passing on

976
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:39,200
idea with a backward message passing on its same but we're going to be able to

977
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:49,609
its same but we're going to be able to account mission is I mean it's insane

978
00:55:49,609 --> 00:55:51,980
account mission is I mean it's insane does really does but in the average

979
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:56,660
does really does but in the average sentence to detect so we need to abuse

980
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:59,809
sentence to detect so we need to abuse some concept of evidenced not miss

981
00:55:59,809 --> 00:56:02,660
some concept of evidenced not miss evidence but some local evidence that is

982
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,819
evidence but some local evidence that is introduced in every chain that comes

983
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:09,680
introduced in every chain that comes from the fact of all the change make

984
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,870
from the fact of all the change make sense

985
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:13,270
sense all right so we're gonna run them

986
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,980
all right so we're gonna run them independently but there must be some

987
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:19,000
independently but there must be some things that influences would say train

988
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,430
things that influences would say train one because this change had in some

989
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:26,290
one because this change had in some state okay so here right actually one of

990
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:31,150
state okay so here right actually one of the questions you need on the on those

991
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:37,030
the questions you need on the on those three lines so this evidence at this

992
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:47,290
three lines so this evidence at this time I call it c PM k alright and time T

993
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:51,520
time I call it c PM k alright and time T it refers to chain M okay and tell them

994
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:58,720
it refers to chain M okay and tell them because listen hmm can be in state K is

995
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,200
because listen hmm can be in state K is what stated this so tell us what is c TM

996
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:08,460
what stated this so tell us what is c TM k trying to do in this equation here

997
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:08,470


998
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:14,440
there's no evidence there's no the release will disappear from the picture

999
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,940
release will disappear from the picture there's no evidence or anything like

1000
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:16,210
there's no evidence or anything like that

1001
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,420
that right when the evidence comes from this

1002
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:22,720
right when the evidence comes from this exists so we'll do this test really are

1003
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,430
exists so we'll do this test really are trying to accomplish the way that you

1004
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:29,840
trying to accomplish the way that you see them on the slide

1005
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:29,850


1006
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:34,580
so for example you know this is a transition for train em from time t

1007
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,980
transition for train em from time t minus 1 t 2 t but you notice I'm

1008
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:46,770
minus 1 t 2 t but you notice I'm conditioning it on Shion

1009
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:46,780


1010
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:51,090
so register we don't mean a word discussed this man so not meaning are

1011
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:59,480
discussed this man so not meaning are you going to attach to this chaps

1012
00:57:59,480 --> 00:57:59,490


1013
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:03,530
hosted a seminar I was well they have to complete them we have no idea where they

1014
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,870
complete them we have no idea where they are but we're trying to mimic something

1015
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:12,580
are but we're trying to mimic something whether we're trying to mimic here a

1016
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:12,590


1017
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:21,550
mixture of gaussians

1018
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:21,560


1019
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:50,400
I remember like this this clay thing here is because I have unchain them

1020
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:50,410


1021
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:56,380
right so this is the only place that will allow me to introduce local

1022
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:01,240
will allow me to introduce local evidence in the model all right so in

1023
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,160
evidence in the model all right so in essence getting rid of all of these

1024
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,420
essence getting rid of all of these things right we're going to do a

1025
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,640
things right we're going to do a variation approximation getting rid of

1026
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,010
variation approximation getting rid of this cutting here all right so this

1027
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:13,300
this cutting here all right so this would be a body mole that accounts for

1028
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,390
would be a body mole that accounts for the effect of all the other change from

1029
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:22,630
the effect of all the other change from China okay we have no idea what G of K

1030
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,430
China okay we have no idea what G of K is so we're gonna have to go in

1031
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:36,430
is so we're gonna have to go in computation or you know is written

1032
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:39,670
computation or you know is written basically like this okay this is for the

1033
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:42,580
basically like this okay this is for the initial state so as we know is for every

1034
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:46,360
initial state so as we know is for every chain from M 1 to M so this is for the

1035
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,430
chain from M 1 to M so this is for the initial state in every train them and

1036
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:50,440
initial state in every train them and this is for the for each type for each

1037
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,320
this is for the for each type for each chain M the transition from t minus 1 to

1038
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,620
chain M the transition from t minus 1 to t ok this is thunder what is different

1039
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,080
t ok this is thunder what is different here is that we conditions is these

1040
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,470
here is that we conditions is these things of local evidence 3 okay and the

1041
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:04,420
things of local evidence 3 okay and the definition of the two variation

1042
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:07,150
definition of the two variation distributions is what you see here okay

1043
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:09,340
distributions is what you see here okay this is the same as before this is the

1044
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:11,740
this is the same as before this is the same as before this is now we plug it in

1045
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:16,000
same as before this is now we plug it in helping to account for the main craft if

1046
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,740
helping to account for the main craft if you like or probably other change from

1047
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:25,279
you like or probably other change from its chain em alright

1048
01:00:25,279 --> 01:00:25,289


1049
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:31,130
so the you know when you calculate basically you take the joint look like

1050
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,769
basically you take the joint look like they could do the variation

1051
01:00:33,769 --> 01:00:35,210
they could do the variation approximation can believe that in a

1052
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:38,749
approximation can believe that in a gives form into some some energy EQ and

1053
01:00:38,749 --> 01:00:43,640
gives form into some some energy EQ and this energy basically has an extremely

1054
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,319
this energy basically has an extremely simple fall alright so obviously you are

1055
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:53,660
simple fall alright so obviously you are going to get you're going to get long

1056
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,390
going to get you're going to get long survey and long supply so this carrying

1057
01:00:56,390 --> 01:01:01,120
survey and long supply so this carrying entities are basically the this log okay

1058
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:05,839
entities are basically the this log okay so let's add all the terms come where is

1059
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:08,569
so let's add all the terms come where is this Pam coming from let's have mr. what

1060
01:01:08,569 --> 01:01:26,060
this Pam coming from let's have mr. what is this term coming from

1061
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:26,070


1062
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:30,230
what is this time can be problem

1063
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:30,240


1064
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:35,089
I mean we have this is what we're looking right and I'm taking logs what

1065
01:01:35,089 --> 01:01:37,390
looking right and I'm taking logs what them here will give me the stuff I

1066
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:40,220
them here will give me the stuff I contain the game discs Academy is the

1067
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,589
contain the game discs Academy is the number of districts II support that idea

1068
01:01:42,589 --> 01:01:50,450
number of districts II support that idea that will come from there from this and

1069
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:54,940
that will come from there from this and there

1070
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:54,950


1071
01:01:54,950 --> 01:02:01,569
when you take your sis okay so this term comes from this term this term will be

1072
01:02:01,569 --> 01:02:02,859
comes from this term this term will be coming from latter

1073
01:02:02,859 --> 01:02:05,319
coming from latter okay well this curvy area is the log of

1074
01:02:05,319 --> 01:02:11,440
okay well this curvy area is the log of this a this term here will come when you

1075
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,720
this a this term here will come when you take logs or come Lister and the

1076
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,240
take logs or come Lister and the incorporation of the loads from Lister

1077
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,539
incorporation of the loads from Lister is accounted already in the summation

1078
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:21,280
is accounted already in the summation here starting from T equal to one

1079
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:29,789
here starting from T equal to one okay approximation right and the change

1080
01:02:29,789 --> 01:02:32,559
okay approximation right and the change is there anything that is explicit that

1081
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:34,839
is there anything that is explicit that this same depends on all the other

1082
01:02:34,839 --> 01:02:37,000
this same depends on all the other change and I remind you what coupling is

1083
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,049
change and I remind you what coupling is coupling at the following movin up so

1084
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:42,819
coupling at the following movin up so the action for scalar is e to the minus

1085
01:02:42,819 --> 01:02:46,150
the action for scalar is e to the minus C and E alright you can see all the

1086
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:55,900
C and E alright you can see all the stage couple together okay alright so

1087
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,210
stage couple together okay alright so what you need to do is so we have the

1088
01:02:58,210 --> 01:03:02,829
what you need to do is so we have the actual energy and the action per student

1089
01:03:02,829 --> 01:03:04,569
actual energy and the action per student but we won't approximate it with this

1090
01:03:04,569 --> 01:03:07,660
but we won't approximate it with this and actively what you need to do is you

1091
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:10,930
and actively what you need to do is you need to form the KL distance between Q

1092
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:13,270
need to form the KL distance between Q and P and minimize the vehicle distance

1093
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:16,900
and P and minimize the vehicle distance with respect to what a long variable I'm

1094
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,400
with respect to what a long variable I'm going to show you that the transition

1095
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,079
going to show you that the transition probabilities and initial probabilities

1096
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:22,329
probabilities and initial probabilities are known so the only unknown on this

1097
01:03:22,329 --> 01:03:25,240
are known so the only unknown on this problem is going to be well so in this

1098
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:32,680
problem is going to be well so in this model that is going to be beyond y'know

1099
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:32,690


1100
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:38,220
the truth - and again access will be the the

1101
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:41,050
- and again access will be the the events and approximation of the local

1102
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,420
events and approximation of the local evidence coming to train em from

1103
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,670
evidence coming to train em from whatever checked so that's the only

1104
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:47,980
whatever checked so that's the only unknown alright we're gonna trim the

1105
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:52,240
unknown alright we're gonna trim the parameters B being a there are unit for

1106
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:58,599
parameters B being a there are unit for simplicity minimization between the

1107
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:02,800
simplicity minimization between the exact P and Q and you do the algebra I

1108
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,540
exact P and Q and you do the algebra I strongly recommend that you do it

1109
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,760
strongly recommend that you do it because I did it and it may have some

1110
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,609
because I did it and it may have some typos maybe not okay so if you do this

1111
01:04:09,609 --> 01:04:13,359
typos maybe not okay so if you do this and you do it carefully it comes out

1112
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:16,120
and you do it carefully it comes out that you need an extremely simple

1113
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:20,770
that you need an extremely simple formula that they obeyed we also have

1114
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:23,020
formula that they obeyed we also have removed state K the update of this

1115
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:25,890
removed state K the update of this record to see is this exponential of

1116
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:28,839
record to see is this exponential of this WM metrics that comes to remember

1117
01:04:28,839 --> 01:04:30,660
this WM metrics that comes to remember in the likelihoods and the covariance

1118
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:34,089
in the likelihoods and the covariance minus one and this is the evidence the

1119
01:04:34,089 --> 01:04:37,950
minus one and this is the evidence the data that is written like that okay and

1120
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:39,339
data that is written like that okay and this

1121
01:04:39,339 --> 01:04:44,829
this vente is is a vector that is formed

1122
01:04:44,829 --> 01:04:46,540
vente is is a vector that is formed basically by taking the diagonal

1123
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:50,500
basically by taking the diagonal elements of this matrix the calculation

1124
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,770
elements of this matrix the calculation is perfect for an infinitely but you

1125
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:56,530
is perfect for an infinitely but you know there is really nothing else except

1126
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:59,640
know there is really nothing else except you know that you have to calculate the

1127
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:02,349
you know that you have to calculate the derivatives of the partition functions

1128
01:05:02,349 --> 01:05:03,820
derivatives of the partition functions of the normalization factors with

1129
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:06,430
of the normalization factors with respect to sis so that's sort of the

1130
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:07,599
respect to sis so that's sort of the only tricky part

1131
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:10,750
only tricky part you cannot allow basically you to work

1132
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:14,170
you cannot allow basically you to work with Q and P that are not normalized so

1133
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:15,670
with Q and P that are not normalized so you need to normalize them and that's

1134
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:18,339
you need to normalize them and that's why you get these locks of zq and locks

1135
01:05:18,339 --> 01:05:20,890
why you get these locks of zq and locks of Z but apart from that the rest is

1136
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:23,410
of Z but apart from that the rest is just history this is a very simple

1137
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:27,430
just history this is a very simple formula all right and in other

1138
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:30,190
formula all right and in other circumstances I will have asked you to

1139
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:32,290
circumstances I will have asked you to write a little computer program to

1140
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:35,740
write a little computer program to actually change to check this portfolio

1141
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:37,780
actually change to check this portfolio key the Markov model

1142
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:41,710
key the Markov model it really works it really works

1143
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:43,780
it really works it really works eben we're here has lots of intuition

1144
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:45,970
eben we're here has lots of intuition they're on the way we decouple the

1145
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:48,820
they're on the way we decouple the evidence is that you worked quite well

1146
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,790
evidence is that you worked quite well okay and again if you think about it the

1147
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:53,740
okay and again if you think about it the only things you have to do is a simple

1148
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:59,050
only things you have to do is a simple update formula okay and the rest is

1149
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:03,010
update formula okay and the rest is basically you know the rest is basically

1150
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:05,350
basically you know the rest is basically have to do a forward and backward mess

1151
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:08,040
have to do a forward and backward mess the propagation the way we have done

1152
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:12,820
the propagation the way we have done earlier with one chain and hidden Markov

1153
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:23,030
earlier with one chain and hidden Markov model

1154
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:23,040


1155
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:29,450
I only have ten minutes sorry basically I can only I can only start something so

1156
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:33,260
I can only I can only start something so we need I'm going to go to a slightly

1157
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:36,170
we need I'm going to go to a slightly different topic for those that are

1158
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:47,330
different topic for those that are familiar with regression

1159
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:47,340


1160
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:55,120
obviously all of this will be posted on the website so let me let me show you

1161
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,470
the website so let me let me show you and maybe we can actually finish it in

1162
01:06:57,470 --> 01:07:03,320
and maybe we can actually finish it in 10 minutes if we can be linear

1163
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:13,670
10 minutes if we can be linear regression using okay now again I am I'm

1164
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:15,920
regression using okay now again I am I'm going to be talking about regression

1165
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,510
going to be talking about regression assuming everybody in the audience knows

1166
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:18,670
assuming everybody in the audience knows with regression

1167
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:35,480
with regression okay here's some basis functions here a

1168
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:38,330
okay here's some basis functions here a linear regression model so you can think

1169
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:39,890
linear regression model so you can think that the response of the system that

1170
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,080
that the response of the system that you've indicated here with is let me

1171
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,820
you've indicated here with is let me respond some with regular basis

1172
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:45,890
respond some with regular basis functions that you can calculate at any

1173
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:48,380
functions that you can calculate at any point X plus some noise the defined here

1174
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:50,660
point X plus some noise the defined here by the precision data so basically I'm

1175
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:54,920
by the precision data so basically I'm taking that the likelihood of data is a

1176
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,840
taking that the likelihood of data is a product of thousands it's authorized

1177
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:03,460
product of thousands it's authorized over the iid day okay so a standard okay

1178
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:06,530
over the iid day okay so a standard okay usually what you do in in Bayesian

1179
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:08,210
usually what you do in in Bayesian regression you're going to put some

1180
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:11,500
regression you're going to put some primer on the dummy here given some

1181
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:18,680
primer on the dummy here given some precision alpha alright and then you put

1182
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:24,260
precision alpha alright and then you put some prior on that is taking I'll see

1183
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:25,760
some prior on that is taking I'll see you at within this you can make this a

1184
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,860
you at within this you can make this a vector of alphas and you can do

1185
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:30,020
vector of alphas and you can do relevance determination and all the this

1186
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:32,390
relevance determination and all the this very nice things for modern selection

1187
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:34,340
very nice things for modern selection but right now there's only one alpha

1188
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:37,070
but right now there's only one alpha alright and

1189
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:41,840
alright and and so what a bad review a laptop is the

1190
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,450
and so what a bad review a laptop is the prior and fearful toys and other hyper

1191
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:53,860
prior and fearful toys and other hyper prior asking the posterior distribution

1192
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:53,870


1193
01:08:53,870 --> 01:09:17,840
solution we have done it ok and become Scouts for any X so and this tradition

1194
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:22,849
Scouts for any X so and this tradition where you know so basically an internet

1195
01:09:22,849 --> 01:09:25,400
where you know so basically an internet if you think of the livelihood at any

1196
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,010
if you think of the livelihood at any location X you know times the posterior

1197
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:31,520
location X you know times the posterior of W integrand of the solutions to all

1198
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,590
of W integrand of the solutions to all of this but we pretend we don't know any

1199
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:36,770
of this but we pretend we don't know any of this and we really want to see

1200
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:50,930
of this and we really want to see Bayesian inference will actually is the

1201
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:56,020
Bayesian inference will actually is the data decide the observations think I'm

1202
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:01,850
data decide the observations think I'm corresponding axis right so I only did

1203
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:04,850
corresponding axis right so I only did that this year but remember this is

1204
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:06,860
that this year but remember this is conditional on the axis as well okay

1205
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:09,260
conditional on the axis as well okay it's not important to mess up the

1206
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:15,860
it's not important to mess up the notation so the the likelihood is nice

1207
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,560
notation so the the likelihood is nice exactly like that right no W I know what

1208
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,920
exactly like that right no W I know what is the probability of T plus a prior or

1209
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,120
is the probability of T plus a prior or value given applause all right and

1210
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,130
value given applause all right and that's the probabilistic after model in

1211
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:32,390
that's the probabilistic after model in a simple sense looks like this okay a

1212
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:34,970
a simple sense looks like this okay a plate rotation for the iid data and

1213
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:41,090
plate rotation for the iid data and basically W open here

1214
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:43,250
basically W open here remind me must be the high

1215
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,900
remind me must be the high parameter coming inside of gamma

1216
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:51,470
parameter coming inside of gamma distribution occasional vaccinations six

1217
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:53,720
distribution occasional vaccinations six days to go we've been assume that cube W

1218
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:57,800
days to go we've been assume that cube W and alpha fertilize director whenever

1219
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,060
and alpha fertilize director whenever you have a knowledge of the exact

1220
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,920
you have a knowledge of the exact solution we'll pretend we never read the

1221
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,540
solution we'll pretend we never read the books so you see now and we want

1222
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:04,790
books so you see now and we want something that basically says that this

1223
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:07,040
something that basically says that this issue of WN always give W times P of

1224
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,690
issue of WN always give W times P of alpha we have no idea what this

1225
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:13,100
alpha we have no idea what this distribution should be okay

1226
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:13,110


1227
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:16,970
you clearly to death and you kill it there funny if you try to do it by can't

1228
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:20,120
there funny if you try to do it by can't otherwise looking at it means nothing

1229
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:24,350
otherwise looking at it means nothing I remind us so the novel by Q powerful

1230
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:27,800
I remind us so the novel by Q powerful for example will be the expectation with

1231
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:32,720
for example will be the expectation with respect to all the other very most so

1232
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:38,259
respect to all the other very most so whether you are the variables here

1233
01:11:38,259 --> 01:11:38,269


1234
01:11:38,269 --> 01:11:43,540
what are the unknowns in this problem so you know when we computed the here what

1235
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:44,649
you know when we computed the here what are the announces that we are not

1236
01:11:44,649 --> 01:11:48,970
are the announces that we are not probably still so the expectation or

1237
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:51,910
probably still so the expectation or when I the join of market we're not

1238
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:53,229
when I the join of market we're not going to be taking expectations here

1239
01:11:53,229 --> 01:11:56,919
going to be taking expectations here with respect to EE you okay so obviously

1240
01:11:56,919 --> 01:12:00,220
with respect to EE you okay so obviously was applied a long time there was a

1241
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:03,759
was applied a long time there was a prior on da be given alpha and alpha

1242
01:12:03,759 --> 01:12:06,810
prior on da be given alpha and alpha doesn't come in the liquid so you know

1243
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:11,500
doesn't come in the liquid so you know constant so this is a gamma alright

1244
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,750
constant so this is a gamma alright this we took it as a Gaussian sham

1245
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:17,020
this we took it as a Gaussian sham taking the terms that depend on alpha

1246
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:19,600
taking the terms that depend on alpha all right the rest I don't care and the

1247
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,239
all right the rest I don't care and the expectation carries with respect to W

1248
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:24,129
expectation carries with respect to W all right so the distribution you think

1249
01:12:24,129 --> 01:12:28,180
all right so the distribution you think you get for cute outfit here look I mean

1250
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,970
you get for cute outfit here look I mean it was much like a little drama

1251
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:36,330
it was much like a little drama distribution what do you think this is

1252
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:36,340


1253
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:42,970
what's the distribution for coupons

1254
01:12:42,970 --> 01:12:42,980


1255
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:47,980
if as long as the gamma distribution arrived with updated parameters because

1256
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:49,480
arrived with updated parameters because you can see never fast but here local

1257
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,970
you can see never fast but here local populace so you have a zero plus M over

1258
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:54,460
populace so you have a zero plus M over 2 minus 1 so the first coefficient is a

1259
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:56,920
2 minus 1 so the first coefficient is a zero plus 10 over 2 and BN is equal to

1260
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,780
zero plus 10 over 2 and BN is equal to that so T of a is a gamma distribution

1261
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:01,870
that so T of a is a gamma distribution not a putz you do the same thing with

1262
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:04,420
not a putz you do the same thing with Dario the expectation now have to be

1263
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:08,740
Dario the expectation now have to be respect to alpha so no surprise actually

1264
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,090
respect to alpha so no surprise actually this distribution comes from be a

1265
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:14,140
this distribution comes from be a Gaussian so that this is the main this

1266
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:17,770
Gaussian so that this is the main this is the variance and no surprise by the

1267
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:20,140
is the variance and no surprise by the way every foot of water is alpha you get

1268
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:56,320
way every foot of water is alpha you get an expectation and the okay okay this is

1269
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:07,150
an expectation and the okay okay this is making you know for basing the

1270
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:21,820
making you know for basing the regression and the difference is there

1271
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:37,380
regression and the difference is there was an alpha now we have the expression

1272
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:37,390


1273
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:46,840
okay so this only having okay this we need to check it out but you notice the

1274
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,520
need to check it out but you notice the coupling right to compute the

1275
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,440
coupling right to compute the distribution of variation of alpha you

1276
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,320
distribution of variation of alpha you need to know the moment W of the

1277
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,670
need to know the moment W of the expectation that means I suppose now

1278
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:56,260
expectation that means I suppose now here so you obviously have to couple the

1279
01:14:56,260 --> 01:15:01,950
here so you obviously have to couple the two equations okay so alright so

1280
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:04,960
two equations okay so alright so actually the results it says here from

1281
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,480
actually the results it says here from what amazing they look exactly the same

1282
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,190
what amazing they look exactly the same reason as you get with expectation

1283
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:10,090
reason as you get with expectation maximization

1284
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:13,660
maximization the only difference is basically if you

1285
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:16,060
the only difference is basically if you use the expectation of alpha all right

1286
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:18,220
use the expectation of alpha all right but we got those in the trivial manner

1287
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:21,010
but we got those in the trivial manner and in some sense you know it tells you

1288
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:23,470
and in some sense you know it tells you that this techniques at the end of the

1289
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:26,560
that this techniques at the end of the day are linked together and I remind you

1290
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,810
day are linked together and I remind you that when the most likely that

1291
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:31,090
that when the most likely that expectation maximization is a trivial

1292
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:33,720
expectation maximization is a trivial stuff case of the variational method

1293
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:36,550
stuff case of the variational method right so it's a simple not a surprise

1294
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:39,580
right so it's a simple not a surprise that you get those results if you want

1295
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:41,200
that you get those results if you want the predictive distribution we have one

1296
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,720
the predictive distribution we have one minute to go basically that you need

1297
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,810
minute to go basically that you need this you need to integrate a lot to be

1298
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:49,360
this you need to integrate a lot to be times the posterior and here because we

1299
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,710
times the posterior and here because we use variational method if you don't see

1300
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:52,450
use variational method if you don't see the exact posterior you put the

1301
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:55,930
the exact posterior you put the variational posterior and this is the

1302
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:57,910
variational posterior and this is the marginalization of the two gaussians

1303
01:15:57,910 --> 01:16:00,910
marginalization of the two gaussians this mean here is a linear dependence

1304
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:03,820
this mean here is a linear dependence from W so the solutions actually we have

1305
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:05,890
from W so the solutions actually we have seen it in three times is given

1306
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:10,480
seen it in three times is given analytically so basically that the mean

1307
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,160
analytically so basically that the mean and the variance the variance right is

1308
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:17,860
and the variance the variance right is and again instead of PowerPoint you get

1309
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:20,500
and again instead of PowerPoint you get the expectation of if you want to

1310
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,460
the expectation of if you want to calculate the variable

1311
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:25,420
calculate the variable surprise surprise the man comes to have

1312
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:28,090
surprise surprise the man comes to have a fantastic wonderful analytical form

1313
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:32,170
a fantastic wonderful analytical form okay yes and if you try to apply this to

1314
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:34,240
okay yes and if you try to apply this to a simple polynomial regression for

1315
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,250
a simple polynomial regression for example you're asking what are the

1316
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:38,940
example you're asking what are the polynomial M so I guess you know

1317
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:42,910
polynomial M so I guess you know obviously you can use whatever maximize

1318
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:45,790
obviously you can use whatever maximize the lower mountain in this case if you

1319
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:47,560
the lower mountain in this case if you do this problem you can all this Python

1320
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,620
do this problem you can all this Python code you can see m equal to three

1321
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:52,299
code you can see m equal to three maximizes the lower bound okay

1322
01:16:52,299 --> 01:16:55,990
maximizes the lower bound okay I warned you from us who study a

1323
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:58,540
I warned you from us who study a disintegration investor regression what

1324
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:00,819
disintegration investor regression what she does with a single flaw but instead

1325
01:17:00,819 --> 01:17:02,680
she does with a single flaw but instead of flapping the low block a man will be

1326
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:08,760
of flapping the low block a man will be plot the model evidence because we can

1327
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,100
plot the model evidence because we can exactly here the assumption is yes we

1328
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:13,990
exactly here the assumption is yes we can calculate the mobile leg that's

1329
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:16,629
can calculate the mobile leg that's exactly but this idea of failure is very

1330
01:17:16,629 --> 01:17:18,879
exactly but this idea of failure is very powerful because in problems with the

1331
01:17:18,879 --> 01:17:21,129
powerful because in problems with the model evidence cannot be calculated you

1332
01:17:21,129 --> 01:17:25,120
model evidence cannot be calculated you can have many developed you okay so we

1333
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:29,310
can have many developed you okay so we will continue that on Thursday and

1334
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:32,350
will continue that on Thursday and continuing become this topic then do

1335
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:34,810
continuing become this topic then do something with Gaussian mixture and some

1336
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:39,130
something with Gaussian mixture and some other interesting aspects
