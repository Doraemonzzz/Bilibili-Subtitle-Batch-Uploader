00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:54,690
通过PLC效果颠倒订单并拥有QC设备
by PLC effects okay everybody familiar with the KL

247
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:01,160
好吧，每个熟悉KL分布距离的人都可以
by PLC effects okay everybody familiar with the KL

248
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,680
好吧，每个熟悉KL分布距离的人都可以
okay everybody familiar with the KL distance of distributions okay it's not

249
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:03,690
好吧，每个熟悉KL分布距离的人都可以
distance of distributions okay it's not a real distance okay

250
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,440
一个真实的距离好吧，这是一个非对称的量，我们将
distance of distributions okay it's not a real distance okay

251
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,670
一个真实的距离好吧，这是一个非对称的量，我们将
a real distance okay it is a non-symmetric quantity we will

252
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:10,680
一个真实的距离好吧，这是一个非对称的量，我们将
it is a non-symmetric quantity we will see actually today but if you have the

253
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,860
今天实际看到的，但是如果P和Q之间的距离不等于
it is a non-symmetric quantity we will see actually today but if you have the

254
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,260
今天实际看到的，但是如果P和Q之间的距离不等于
see actually today but if you have the distance between P and Q is not equal to

255
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:15,270
今天实际看到的，但是如果P和Q之间的距离不等于
distance between P and Q is not equal to this so this is very important for this

256
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,600
因此，这对于Q到P的距离而不是P到Q的距离非常重要
distance between P and Q is not equal to this so this is very important for this

257
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,930
因此，这对于Q到P的距离而不是P到Q的距离非常重要
this so this is very important for this the distance of Q from P not P from Q

258
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:20,940
因此，这对于Q到P的距离而不是P到Q的距离非常重要
the distance of Q from P not P from Q okay

259
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,110
好的，当Q和P分别是
the distance of Q from P not P from Q okay

260
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,390
好的，当Q和P分别是
okay this distance is zero when Q and P are

261
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:26,400
好的，当Q和P分别是
this distance is zero when Q and P are equal it is greater or equal to zero and

262
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,850
等于等于或大于零，并且因为等于或大于零
this distance is zero when Q and P are equal it is greater or equal to zero and

263
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,950
等于等于或大于零，并且因为等于或大于零
equal it is greater or equal to zero and because it's greater or equal to zero

264
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:30,960
等于等于或大于零，并且因为等于或大于零
because it's greater or equal to zero what you see here is greater or equal to

265
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,090
您在这里看到的是大于或等于2l q
because it's greater or equal to zero what you see here is greater or equal to

266
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,540
您在这里看到的是大于或等于2l q
what you see here is greater or equal to 2l q

267
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:35,550
您在这里看到的是大于或等于2l q
2l q and that's why we call L Q the lower

268
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,120
这就是为什么我们将LQ称为您选择的对数可能性的下限
2l q and that's why we call L Q the lower

269
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,920
这就是为什么我们将LQ称为您选择的对数可能性的下限
and that's why we call L Q the lower bound to the log-likelihood you select

270
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:41,930
这就是为什么我们将LQ称为您选择的对数可能性的下限
bound to the log-likelihood you select because the KO distance is positive

271
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,450
因为KO距离是正数，所以Q的M是一个下界
bound to the log-likelihood you select because the KO distance is positive

272
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,750
因为KO距离是正数，所以Q的M是一个下界
because the KO distance is positive right so the M of Q is a lower bound

273
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
因为KO距离是正数，所以Q的M是一个下界
right so the M of Q is a lower bound basically to the log likelihood so if

274
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,590
基本上是对数似然的，所以如果您真的想近似
right so the M of Q is a lower bound basically to the log likelihood so if

275
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,440
基本上是对数似然的，所以如果您真的想近似
basically to the log likelihood so if you want really an approximation of the

276
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:54,450
基本上是对数似然的，所以如果您真的想近似
you want really an approximation of the log likelihood because this is

277
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,000
对数似然，因为这在计算上是
you want really an approximation of the log likelihood because this is

278
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,430
对数似然，因为这在计算上是
log likelihood because this is computationally the

279
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
对数似然，因为这在计算上是
computationally the to come thing to do what is very easy to

280
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,400
做一件很容易做的事就是计算机爱你，因为它
computationally the to come thing to do what is very easy to

281
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,410
做一件很容易做的事就是计算机爱你，因为它
to come thing to do what is very easy to do is computer love you because it

282
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:02,420
做一件很容易做的事就是计算机爱你，因为它
do is computer love you because it involves the joining of log magnitude

283
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,810
涉及到对数幅度的连接在这里好吧，我们只在
do is computer love you because it involves the joining of log magnitude

284
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,590
涉及到对数幅度的连接在这里好吧，我们只在
involves the joining of log magnitude here okay and we only have seen in the

285
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:08,600
涉及到对数幅度的连接在这里好吧，我们只在
here okay and we only have seen in the contest of expectation maximization in

286
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,470
期望最大化竞赛实际上是您想要的原因
here okay and we only have seen in the contest of expectation maximization in

287
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,240
期望最大化竞赛实际上是您想要的原因
contest of expectation maximization in fact there is a reason you would like to

288
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,250
期望最大化竞赛实际上是您想要的原因
fact there is a reason you would like to work with the affection Z because for

289
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,360
与情感Z一起工作，因为例如，如果此联合分布为
fact there is a reason you would like to work with the affection Z because for

290
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,190
与情感Z一起工作，因为例如，如果此联合分布为
work with the affection Z because for example if this joint distribution is

291
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,200
与情感Z一起工作，因为例如，如果此联合分布为
example if this joint distribution is Gaussian everything falls nicely and the

292
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,800
高斯一切都很好，计算很容易，但是很有效
example if this joint distribution is Gaussian everything falls nicely and the

293
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,840
高斯一切都很好，计算很容易，但是很有效
Gaussian everything falls nicely and the calculations is easy but working

294
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:22,850
高斯一切都很好，计算很容易，但是很有效
calculations is easy but working directly with this it requires

295
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,230
直接与此相关，它需要在Z中集成，而这并不是
calculations is easy but working directly with this it requires

296
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,840
直接与此相关，它需要在Z中集成，而这并不是
directly with this it requires integration in Z and that's not

297
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:28,850
直接与此相关，它需要在Z中集成，而这并不是
integration in Z and that's not convenient to do let's prove this

298
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,570
方便进行让我们证明这个等式证明是微不足道的
integration in Z and that's not convenient to do let's prove this

299
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:39,340
方便进行让我们证明这个等式证明是微不足道的
convenient to do let's prove this equation the proof is trivial

300
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:39,350
方便进行让我们证明这个等式证明是微不足道的
equation the proof is trivial so the we use the definition of L of Q

301
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,100
所以我们使用Q的L的定义所以很多Q我们将其定义为
equation the proof is trivial so the we use the definition of L of Q

302
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,020
所以我们使用Q的L的定义所以很多Q我们将其定义为
so the we use the definition of L of Q so a lot Q we define it to be like that

303
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,030
所以我们使用Q的L的定义所以很多Q我们将其定义为
so a lot Q we define it to be like that so this is what it is so I'm expanding

304
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,780
所以就是这样，所以我正在扩展X的Z的T的QZ日志加上Z的Q
so a lot Q we define it to be like that so this is what it is so I'm expanding

305
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:52,510
所以就是这样，所以我正在扩展X的Z的T的QZ日志加上Z的Q
so this is what it is so I'm expanding our Q Z log of T of Z of X plus Q of Z

306
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:52,520
所以就是这样，所以我正在扩展X的Z的T的QZ日志加上Z的Q
our Q Z log of T of Z of X plus Q of Z log of T of X minus Q of Z log of Q of Z

307
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,730
X的T的对数减去Z的Q的对数Z的对数很好现在可以更长的效果了
our Q Z log of T of Z of X plus Q of Z log of T of X minus Q of Z log of Q of Z

308
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:05,590
X的T的对数减去Z的Q的对数Z的对数很好现在可以更长的效果了
log of T of X minus Q of Z log of Q of Z all right nice okay now longer effects

309
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
X的T的对数减去Z的Q的对数Z的对数很好现在可以更长的效果了
all right nice okay now longer effects does not depend on Z so I can put

310
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,750
不依赖于Z，所以我可以放在积分之外，我假设Q
all right nice okay now longer effects does not depend on Z so I can put

311
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,600
不依赖于Z，所以我可以放在积分之外，我假设Q
does not depend on Z so I can put outside the integral and I am assuming Q

312
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:10,610
不依赖于Z，所以我可以放在积分之外，我假设Q
outside the integral and I am assuming Q the distribution huge normalize so the

313
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,780
分布巨大归一化，所以Q DZ的积分将给我1那么
outside the integral and I am assuming Q the distribution huge normalize so the

314
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,540
分布巨大归一化，所以Q DZ的积分将给我1那么
the distribution huge normalize so the integral of Q DZ will give me 1 so what

315
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:16,550
分布巨大归一化，所以Q DZ的积分将给我1那么
integral of Q DZ will give me 1 so what I'm gonna get is from this term I'm

316
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,640
我要从这个学期得到的是对数的可能性，然后我
integral of Q DZ will give me 1 so what I'm gonna get is from this term I'm

317
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,490
我要从这个学期得到的是对数的可能性，然后我
I'm gonna get is from this term I'm gonna get the log likelihood and then I

318
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:21,500
我要从这个学期得到的是对数的可能性，然后我
gonna get the log likelihood and then I have basically the rest of the terms

319
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,870
基本上有其余的项，这就是ZX的P的Q对数
gonna get the log likelihood and then I have basically the rest of the terms

320
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,740
基本上有其余的项，这就是ZX的P的Q对数
have basically the rest of the terms which is Q log of P of Z X okay this

321
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:26,750
基本上有其余的项，这就是ZX的P的Q对数
which is Q log of P of Z X okay this term comes from here and then minus Q

322
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,890
项来自这里，然后是Q的负Q的对数，所以这是负的
which is Q log of P of Z X okay this term comes from here and then minus Q

323
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:34,810
项来自这里，然后是Q的负Q的对数，所以这是负的
term comes from here and then minus Q log of Q is there so this is minus the

324
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:34,820
项来自这里，然后是Q的负Q的对数，所以这是负的
log of Q is there so this is minus the cubot liberal distance this is the log

325
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,040
cubot自由距离，这是证据的对数，因此您可以看到
log of Q is there so this is minus the cubot liberal distance this is the log

326
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,170
cubot自由距离，这是证据的对数，因此您可以看到
cubot liberal distance this is the log of the evidence so you can see that the

327
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:41,180
cubot自由距离，这是证据的对数，因此您可以看到
of the evidence so you can see that the love of the evidence is the lower bound

328
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,000
喜欢证据的是QP的下界加上KL距离
of the evidence so you can see that the love of the evidence is the lower bound

329
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,290
喜欢证据的是QP的下界加上KL距离
love of the evidence is the lower bound plus the KL distance of QP okay very

all right so we explain why this is a lower bound

345
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,160
所以我们解释为什么这是一个下界好吗，这就是你的照片
all right so we explain why this is a lower bound

347
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:19,930
所以我们解释为什么这是一个下界好吗，这就是你的照片
okay and this is the picture sort of you want to remember like the only thing we

348
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,090
想要记住，就像我们拥有数据时唯一拥有的就是这一证据
okay and this is the picture sort of you want to remember like the only thing we

想要记住，就像我们拥有数据时唯一拥有的就是这一证据
have when we have data is this evidence so we're always trying to maximize the

351
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,280
所以我们一直在努力最大化数据的证据，所以无论未知什么
have when we have data is this evidence so we're always trying to maximize the

352
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,870
所以我们一直在努力最大化数据的证据，所以无论未知什么
so we're always trying to maximize the evidence of the data so whatever unknown

353
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
所以我们一直在努力最大化数据的证据，所以无论未知什么
evidence of the data so whatever unknown parameters we care starts as Z or static

354
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,350
我们关心的参数始于Z或静态参数theta，
evidence of the data so whatever unknown parameters we care starts as Z or static

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:36,550
我们关心的参数始于Z或静态参数theta，
parameters theta the only really really we can in a Bayesian setting we can

357
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,760
我们可以在贝叶斯设置中，我们可以通过最大化来计算未知数

359
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:41,380
我们可以在贝叶斯设置中，我们可以通过最大化来计算未知数
compute the unknowns is by maximizing the evidence okay and we just have seen

360
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,360
证据还可以，我们只是看到证据是两个词，
compute the unknowns is by maximizing the evidence okay and we just have seen

361
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,280
证据还可以，我们只是看到证据是两个词，
the evidence okay and we just have seen that the evidence yes two terms the

362
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,290
证据还可以，我们只是看到证据是两个词，
that the evidence yes two terms the killing of distance between Q and P and

363
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,080
Q和P之间的距离和下限之间的差被杀死，因此您可以认为
that the evidence yes two terms the killing of distance between Q and P and

364
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,690
Q和P之间的距离和下限之间的差被杀死，因此您可以认为
killing of distance between Q and P and the lower bound so you can think the

365
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:51,700
Q和P之间的距离和下限之间的差被杀死，因此您可以认为
the lower bound so you can think the problem in two ways one is you say I'm

each variable right but it's a factorize product okay so this is the essential

609
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,080
产品还可以，所以这是开始的必不可少的部分，所以我们
product okay so this is the essential part to start with alright so we're

610
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,090
产品还可以，所以这是开始的必不可少的部分，所以我们
part to start with alright so we're going to use this limitation this

611
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,480
将使用此限制对Z的定义Q进行逼近，然后
part to start with alright so we're going to use this limitation this

612
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,210
将使用此限制对Z的定义Q进行逼近，然后
going to use this limitation this approximation on define Q of Z and then

613
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:40,220
将使用此限制对Z的定义Q进行逼近，然后
approximation on define Q of Z and then somehow we're going to use the

618
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,490
计算这两只眼睛的形式是什么，我们将假设
to compute what is the form of this two eyes and we're going to assume that

619
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:54,500
计算这两只眼睛的形式是什么，我们将假设
eyes and we're going to assume that there are generational about to start

620
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,320
有几代人将要开始，所以我们将像
eyes and we're going to assume that there are generational about to start

621
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,720
有几代人将要开始，所以我们将像
there are generational about to start with so we will do this as general as

622
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:58,730
有几代人将要开始，所以我们将像
with so we will do this as general as possible and and after that we which

an integration disease but now I integrate in overseas

730
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,270
疾病，但现在我整合到海外，但今天，然后整合
an integration disease but now I integrate in overseas

731
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,940
疾病，但现在我整合到海外，但今天，然后整合
disease but now I integrate in overseas but today and then the integrations a

732
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:51,950
疾病，但现在我整合到海外，但今天，然后整合
but today and then the integrations a separately so this then you get it like

733
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:56,050
分开，这样就可以得到正确的结果，基本上是
but today and then the integrations a separately so this then you get it like

734
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,170
分开，这样就可以得到正确的结果，基本上是
separately so this then you get it like that right is basically the average of

735
00:28:59,170 --> 00:28:59,180
分开，这样就可以得到正确的结果，基本上是
that right is basically the average of the Journal of likelihood with respect

736
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,960
关于另一个人的住房分布的可能性杂志
that right is basically the average of the Journal of likelihood with respect

737
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,760
关于另一个人的住房分布的可能性杂志
the Journal of likelihood with respect to the distribution of home of the other

738
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:03,770
关于另一个人的住房分布的可能性杂志
to the distribution of home of the other variables but J okay all right

739
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:08,830
变量，但J好的，可以把这个东西放到这里，所以我有一些
to the distribution of home of the other variables but J okay all right

740
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:14,530
变量，但J好的，可以把这个东西放到这里，所以我有一些
variables but J okay all right place this thing coming so I have some

741
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:14,540
变量，但J好的，可以把这个东西放到这里，所以我有一些
place this thing coming so I have some looking on this there on everything

742
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,510
看着这里，除了J还好
place this thing coming so I have some looking on this there on everything

743
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,550
看着这里，除了J还好
looking on this there on everything except J alright

744
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:18,560
看着这里，除了J还好
except J alright everything except J and will you agree

745
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,850
除了J之外的所有东西，你会同意我的意思吗，但是在这里我只会
except J alright everything except J and will you agree

746
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:26,050
除了J之外的所有东西，你会同意我的意思吗，但是在这里我只会
everything except J and will you agree with me but here I'm only gonna have the

747
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:26,060
除了J之外的所有东西，你会同意我的意思吗，但是在这里我只会
with me but here I'm only gonna have the product of the Q eyes at the Thames a

748
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,110
Q眼对泰晤士河a的乘积，因为资金就是你
with me but here I'm only gonna have the product of the Q eyes at the Thames a

749
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,210
Q眼对泰晤士河a的乘积，因为资金就是你
product of the Q eyes at the Thames a because the funds are you would be

750
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:31,220
Q眼对泰晤士河a的乘积，因为资金就是你
because the funds are you would be integrated with 0 will give me loud

751
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,290
与0积分会给我很大声，因为那里没有J，ZJ还可以，
because the funds are you would be integrated with 0 will give me loud

752
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:40,930
与0积分会给我很大声，因为那里没有J，ZJ还可以，
integrated with 0 will give me loud because there's no J there ZJ okay and

753
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:40,940
与0积分会给我很大声，因为那里没有J，ZJ还可以，
because there's no J there ZJ okay and then I'm gonna have an expert then when

754
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,970
那我要请一位专家，当我在这里拿到QJ的日志时，
because there's no J there ZJ okay and then I'm gonna have an expert then when

755
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,510
那我要请一位专家，当我在这里拿到QJ的日志时，
then I'm gonna have an expert then when I pick up here the log of Q J and I'm

756
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:46,520
那我要请一位专家，当我在这里拿到QJ的日志时，
I pick up here the log of Q J and I'm going to keep here the longer the QJ

757
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,080
QJ曲线以及所有其他项将保持在此处的时间更长
I pick up here the log of Q J and I'm going to keep here the longer the QJ

758
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,250
QJ曲线以及所有其他项将保持在此处的时间更长
going to keep here the longer the QJ curve as well all the other terms will

759
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:54,260
QJ曲线以及所有其他项将保持在此处的时间更长
curve as well all the other terms will be degraded to one well as a tory

760
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,930
降级为保守的一口井，因为教会本应归一化
curve as well all the other terms will be degraded to one well as a tory

761
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:01,920
降级为保守的一口井，因为教会本应归一化
be degraded to one well as a tory because the church shall have normalized

762
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:01,930
降级为保守的一口井，因为教会本应归一化
because the church shall have normalized okay

763
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:09,440
好的
because the church shall have normalized okay

764
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:09,450
好的


765
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,260
好的
all right

766
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:12,550
所以我让我将这整个事情称为整个括号，因为
all right

767
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:12,560
所以我让我将这整个事情称为整个括号，因为


768
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:20,500
所以我让我将这整个事情称为整个括号，因为
so I am let me call this whole thing this whole parenthesis because is going

769
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:20,510
所以我让我将这整个事情称为整个括号，因为
this whole parenthesis because is going to be a function of Z J because all the

770
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,620
是ZJ的功能，因为其他所有功能现在都可以集成
this whole parenthesis because is going to be a function of Z J because all the

771
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,720
是ZJ的功能，因为其他所有功能现在都可以集成
to be a function of Z J because all the others this would be integrate now right

772
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:25,730
是ZJ的功能，因为其他所有功能现在都可以集成
others this would be integrate now right some what I call this peak with a care

773
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:29,170
一些我称之为X逗号CJ的高峰，好吧，我声称这是
others this would be integrate now right some what I call this peak with a care

774
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:32,920
一些我称之为X逗号CJ的高峰，好吧，我声称这是
some what I call this peak with a care of X comma CJ okay and I'm claiming this

775
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:32,930
一些我称之为X逗号CJ的高峰，好吧，我声称这是
of X comma CJ okay and I'm claiming this longer this the wholly integral okay we

776
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:37,360
更长的时间，这完全不可或缺的好吧，我们将了解为什么现在不重要
of X comma CJ okay and I'm claiming this longer this the wholly integral okay we

777
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,150
更长的时间，这完全不可或缺的好吧，我们将了解为什么现在不重要
longer this the wholly integral okay we will see why it doesn't matter right now

778
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:40,160
更长的时间，这完全不可或缺的好吧，我们将了解为什么现在不重要
will see why it doesn't matter right now just the I define this to be log of P P

779
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,660
只是我将其定义为PP曲线的对数，所以这是QJ倍
will see why it doesn't matter right now just the I define this to be log of P P

780
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,940
只是我将其定义为PP曲线的对数，所以这是QJ倍
just the I define this to be log of P P curve alright so this is Q J times that

781
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:47,950
只是我将其定义为PP曲线的对数，所以这是QJ倍
curve alright so this is Q J times that okay and remember I only want to keep

782
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:52,330
好吧，请记住，我只想保留ZJ的时间，因为我想做一个
curve alright so this is Q J times that okay and remember I only want to keep

783
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,670
好吧，请记住，我只想保留ZJ的时间，因为我想做一个
okay and remember I only want to keep the times in Z J because I want to do a

784
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:54,680
好吧，请记住，我只想保留ZJ的时间，因为我想做一个
the times in Z J because I want to do a maximization with respect to Q J okay so

785
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,030
关于QJ最大化，所以我唯一看不到的是
the times in Z J because I want to do a maximization with respect to Q J okay so

786
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,980
关于QJ最大化，所以我唯一看不到的是
maximization with respect to Q J okay so the only thing that I don't see any

787
00:30:59,980 --> 00:30:59,990
关于QJ最大化，所以我唯一看不到的是
the only thing that I don't see any future here do you see linkage a of the

788
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,170
未来在这里，您是否看到第二次的链接a也没有任何内容
the only thing that I don't see any future here do you see linkage a of the

789
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,600
未来在这里，您是否看到第二次的链接a也没有任何内容
future here do you see linkage a of the second time there is nothing there also

790
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:04,610
未来在这里，您是否看到第二次的链接a也没有任何内容
second time there is nothing there also we don't really care

791
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,830
我们不在乎我们将其称为常量，然后我们将
second time there is nothing there also we don't really care

792
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,880
我们不在乎我们将其称为常量，然后我们将
we don't really care we call it constant and then we have the

793
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:09,890
我们不在乎我们将其称为常量，然后我们将
we call it constant and then we have the entropy basically of DJ which is this

794
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,610
DJ的熵基本上可以吗
we call it constant and then we have the entropy basically of DJ which is this

795
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,980
DJ的熵基本上可以吗
entropy basically of DJ which is this okay

796
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:13,990
DJ的熵基本上可以吗
okay the rest is basically functional

797
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,280
其余的基本上是功能优化，这就是为什么这些动词
okay the rest is basically functional

798
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,200
其余的基本上是功能优化，这就是为什么这些动词
the rest is basically functional optimization and that's why these verbs

799
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,210
其余的基本上是功能优化，这就是为什么这些动词
optimization and that's why these verbs are called variational you're going to

800
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,300
被称为变分，您将不得不采用
optimization and that's why these verbs are called variational you're going to

801
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,610
被称为变分，您将不得不采用
are called variational you're going to have to take derivatives of this with

802
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:24,620
被称为变分，您将不得不采用
have to take derivatives of this with respect to Q J alright and set this

803
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:31,450
尊重QJ好，并将其设置为零，但您知道我们可以
have to take derivatives of this with respect to Q J alright and set this

804
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:36,340
尊重QJ好，并将其设置为零，但您知道我们可以
respect to Q J alright and set this equal to zero but you know we can

805
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:36,350
尊重QJ好，并将其设置为零，但您知道我们可以
equal to zero but you know we can immediately see also from this is the

806
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,160
马上也可以看到，这是右下限，我们可以看到
equal to zero but you know we can immediately see also from this is the

807
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,660
马上也可以看到，这是右下限，我们可以看到
immediately see also from this is the lower bound right we can see that

808
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:42,670
马上也可以看到，这是右下限，我们可以看到
lower bound right we can see that without any calculations actually

809
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,040
没有任何计算，实际上没有任何派生，这件事
lower bound right we can see that without any calculations actually

810
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,530
没有任何计算，实际上没有任何派生，这件事
without any calculations actually without any derivatives that this thing

811
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:47,540
没有任何计算，实际上没有任何派生，这件事
without any derivatives that this thing here is minus the cool but liberal

812
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,990
这是我们从此P曲线减去QJ的凉爽但宽松的距离
without any derivatives that this thing here is minus the cool but liberal

813
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:54,400
这是我们从此P曲线减去QJ的凉爽但宽松的距离
here is minus the cool but liberal distance of Q J from this P curve we see

814
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:54,410
这是我们从此P曲线减去QJ的凉爽但宽松的距离
distance of Q J from this P curve we see that

815
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,740
那
distance of Q J from this P curve we see that

816
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:01,030
你还记得这里的距离，没有减号吗
distance of Q J from this P curve we see that

817
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:01,040
你还记得这里的距离，没有减号吗


818
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,799
你还记得这里的距离，没有减号吗
you remember the courtly distance without the minus signs here right it

819
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:05,809
你还记得这里的距离，没有减号吗
without the minus signs here right it would be the minus the integral of kids

820
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:08,950
将减去孩子的积分，这是一个/可爱的一个，所以您将得到
without the minus signs here right it would be the minus the integral of kids

821
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:15,150
将减去孩子的积分，这是一个/可爱的一个，所以您将得到
would be the minus the integral of kids a this / cute a so you're going to get

822
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:15,160
将减去孩子的积分，这是一个/可爱的一个，所以您将得到
a this / cute a so you're going to get there was a madness and this is in the

823
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,520
有一种疯狂，这是分母中的另一种-失踪和
a this / cute a so you're going to get there was a madness and this is in the

824
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,890
有一种疯狂，这是分母中的另一种-失踪和
there was a madness and this is in the denominator another - disappearance and

825
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:20,900
有一种疯狂，这是分母中的另一种-失踪和
denominator another - disappearance and with this thing we get here - which is

826
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,140
有了这件事，我们到了这里-没关系，所以您可以看到
denominator another - disappearance and with this thing we get here - which is

827
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:30,640
有了这件事，我们到了这里-没关系，所以您可以看到
with this thing we get here - which is this okay so you can see what's the

828
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:30,650
有了这件事，我们到了这里-没关系，所以您可以看到
this okay so you can see what's the optimal solution but maximize what is

829
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,490
最优解，但最大化下界L的QJ是多少
this okay so you can see what's the optimal solution but maximize what is

830
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,039
最优解，但最大化下界L的QJ是多少
optimal solution but maximize what is the Q J that much lies the lower bound L

the Q J that much lies the lower bound L of Q where we are scum again we do the

832
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:39,490
Q的问题，我们再次败类，我们一次做了优化，
the Q J that much lies the lower bound L of Q where we are scum again we do the

833
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,950
Q的问题，我们再次败类，我们一次做了优化，
of Q where we are scum again we do the optimization one time at the time that

834
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:41,960
Q的问题，我们再次败类，我们一次做了优化，
optimization one time at the time that the rest of the terms have to be left

835
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,070
剩下的这些术语必须保留下来，这样才是最优的QJ
optimization one time at the time that the rest of the terms have to be left

836
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:54,159
剩下的这些术语必须保留下来，这样才是最优的QJ
the rest of the terms have to be left alone okay so that is the optimal QJ we

837
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:54,169
剩下的这些术语必须保留下来，这样才是最优的QJ
alone okay so that is the optimal QJ we want to maximize this with the - time we

838
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:58,990
想要最大程度地利用-我们想最小化KL距离的时间是什么

00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,110
Q QJ会等于这个好吧，好吧，让我写下来
all right and and let me just write down so we defined us to be this picture to

858
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:52,000
所以我们将我们定义为这张图片，对不起，小图片对，所以
all right and and let me just write down so we defined us to be this picture to

859
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,100
所以我们将我们定义为这张图片，对不起，小图片对，所以
so we defined us to be this picture to be I'm sorry little picture right so

860
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,110
所以我们将我们定义为这张图片，对不起，小图片对，所以
be I'm sorry little picture right so what I'm writing here the longer picture

861
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,830
我在这里写的是更长的图片，这是我的定义，对，这是
be I'm sorry little picture right so what I'm writing here the longer picture

862
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,470
我在这里写的是更长的图片，这是我的定义，对，这是
what I'm writing here the longer picture is this is my definition right this is

863
00:33:59,470 --> 00:33:59,480
我在这里写的是更长的图片，这是我的定义，对，这是
is this is my definition right this is what they have so when you agree with me

864
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,810
他们有什么，当你同意我的看法时，更长的图景就是
is this is my definition right this is what they have so when you agree with me

865
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,590
他们有什么，当你同意我的看法时，更长的图景就是
what they have so when you agree with me that the longer picture is the

866
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:04,600
他们有什么，当你同意我的看法时，更长的图景就是
that the longer picture is the expectation with respect to other

867
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,940
除联合声明外，对其他分布的期望
that the longer picture is the expectation with respect to other

878
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:35,540
眼睛，但是J好吧，你告诉我QJ这个最优值等于
this optimal going to becomes equal to PQ all right come on I'm looking for

879
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,830
PQ好的，来吧，我正在寻找方程式，所以你告诉了什么
this optimal going to becomes equal to PQ all right come on I'm looking for

880
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,710
PQ好的，来吧，我正在寻找方程式，所以你告诉了什么
PQ all right come on I'm looking for that equation okay so what did you tell

881
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:41,720
PQ好的，来吧，我正在寻找方程式，所以你告诉了什么
that equation okay so what did you tell me that this is optimal when this

882
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,810
我说，当它等于那个时，这是最优的，这意味着我
that equation okay so what did you tell me that this is optimal when this

883
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:48,010
我说，当它等于那个时，这是最优的，这意味着我
me that this is optimal when this becomes equal to that so which means my

884
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:48,020
我说，当它等于那个时，这是最优的，这意味着我
becomes equal to that so which means my take the logs the run up to j is equal

885
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,250
取对数，直到j的运行等于p KL的对数，而较低的峰值油为

to log of p KL and lower peak oil was this alright and if I write this if I

888
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:57,250
好的，如果我写这个，如果我对其进行归一化，这是最佳的
to log of p KL and lower peak oil was this alright and if I write this if I

889
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,440
好的，如果我写这个，如果我对其进行归一化，这是最佳的
this alright and if I write this if I normalize it this is the optimal

890
00:34:59,440 --> 00:34:59,450
好的，如果我写这个，如果我对其进行归一化，这是最佳的
normalize it this is the optimal distribution project project

look at it very carefully okay all right usually an easier way to remember is

894
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:11,250
通常更容易记住的方法是这里的方程式还可以
look at it very carefully okay all right usually an easier way to remember is

00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,740
通常更容易记住的方法是这里的方程式还可以
usually an easier way to remember is this equation here okay

896
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:14,750
通常更容易记住的方法是这里的方程式还可以
this equation here okay rather than this so the reason I should

897
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,320
而不是这个，所以我要说的原因是这些字眼与
this equation here okay rather than this so the reason I should

898
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,420
而不是这个，所以我要说的原因是这些字眼与
rather than this so the reason I should say is these words with respect to the

899
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:22,430
而不是这个，所以我要说的原因是这些字眼与
say is these words with respect to the other this that the longer joint of

900
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,510
除此之外，可能性更长的关节还可以
say is these words with respect to the other this that the longer joint of

901
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:29,170
除此之外，可能性更长的关节还可以
other this that the longer joint of likelihood okay

902
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:29,180
除此之外，可能性更长的关节还可以
likelihood okay now obviously if you take an average

903
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,210
现在很明显，如果您对其他所有提示都取平均值，
likelihood okay now obviously if you take an average

904
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,030
现在很明显，如果您对其他所有提示都取平均值，
now obviously if you take an average with respect to all the other cues right

905
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,040
现在很明显，如果您对其他所有提示都取平均值，
with respect to all the other cues right you have to iterate this that's why I

906
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,490
您必须对此进行迭代，这就是为什么我说您必须假设这样做
with respect to all the other cues right you have to iterate this that's why I

907
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,690
您必须对此进行迭代，这就是为什么我说您必须假设这样做
you have to iterate this that's why I said you have to assume this to

908
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:37,700
您必须对此进行迭代，这就是为什么我说您必须假设这样做
said you have to assume this to self-consistency so if you start with

909
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,420
自洽性，因此，如果您从说开始，您可以近似地定义
said you have to assume this to self-consistency so if you start with

910
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,870
自洽性，因此，如果您从说开始，您可以近似地定义
self-consistency so if you start with say and you approximate you define the

911
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:43,880
自洽性，因此，如果您从说开始，您可以近似地定义
say and you approximate you define the optimal for q1 keeping all the other

912
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,720
保持所有其他提示固定不变，对q1最优，然后对进行最优选择
say and you approximate you define the optimal for q1 keeping all the other

913
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,240
保持所有其他提示固定不变，对q1最优，然后对进行最优选择
optimal for q1 keeping all the other cues fixed then you go to optimal of

914
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,250
保持所有其他提示固定不变，对q1最优，然后对进行最优选择
cues fixed then you go to optimal of people to think you won and the rest are

915
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,190
人们以为你赢了，其余的都固定了，你一直在迭代直到
cues fixed then you go to optimal of people to think you won and the rest are

916
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,340
人们以为你赢了，其余的都固定了，你一直在迭代直到
people to think you won and the rest are fixed and you keep iterating until

917
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:53,350
人们以为你赢了，其余的都固定了，你一直在迭代直到
fixed and you keep iterating until basically you're happy that they are not

918
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,720
基本上，您很高兴他们不是变化，这就是一致性
fixed and you keep iterating until basically you're happy that they are not

919
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,690
基本上，您很高兴他们不是变化，这就是一致性
basically you're happy that they are not changes that's what's that consistency

920
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:58,700
基本上，您很高兴他们不是变化，这就是一致性
changes that's what's that consistency means and now why do they call this the

921
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,940
手段，现在为什么将其称为门肯近似法是什么方法
changes that's what's that consistency means and now why do they call this the

922
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,780
手段，现在为什么将其称为门肯近似法是什么方法
means and now why do they call this the Menken approximation what is the method

923
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:04,790
手段，现在为什么将其称为门肯近似法是什么方法
Menken approximation what is the method that makes this to sort of be a mean

924
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,510
这使得它成为主要领域的平均领域，我的意思是你所知道的

932
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:29,670
期望权，以便您知道要使用此权利来计算此权利
calculate this right you are using the expectation of the log likelihood of the

933
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:33,260
您所在位置的似然对数的对数似然期望
calculate this right you are using the expectation of the log likelihood of the

join of likelihood where you are with respect to the distributions so this is

936
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,210
关于分布，所以这有点您知道，如果您说有很多
join of likelihood where you are with respect to the distributions so this is

937
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,490
关于分布，所以这有点您知道，如果您说有很多
respect to the distributions so this is sort of you know if you say have many

938
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:46,500
关于分布，所以这有点您知道，如果您说有很多
sort of you know if you say have many electrons moving around and you want

939
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,230
电子四处移动，你想要一个单电子问题中的光
sort of you know if you say have many electrons moving around and you want

电子四处移动，你想要一个单电子问题中的光
light in a question for a one-electron you know we are doing the computation in

942
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:54,770
你知道我们正在以电子的平均速度进行计算，然后

944
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:57,990
你知道我们正在以电子的平均速度进行计算，然后
the average speed of electrons and then we get there was a political sort of the

945
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,600
我们得到一个政治问题，在这种情况下，我们得到了一个等式
the average speed of electrons and then we get there was a political sort of the

946
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,760
我们得到一个政治问题，在这种情况下，我们得到了一个等式
we get there was a political sort of the question in this case we get an equation

947
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:01,770
我们得到一个政治问题，在这种情况下，我们得到了一个等式
question in this case we get an equation for the distribution through J in the

948
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,700
通过所有其他人的平均分布中通过J的分布
question in this case we get an equation for the distribution through J in the

average distribution of the other of all the other guys all right so that's where

951
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:19,220
其他人都没事，这就是平均场近似值，是的，所以你
average distribution of the other of all the other guys all right so that's where

952
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,800
其他人都没事，这就是平均场近似值，是的，所以你
the other guys all right so that's where the mean field approximation yeah so you

953
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:21,810
其他人都没事，这就是平均场近似值，是的，所以你
the mean field approximation yeah so you can feel for example I mean and we may

954
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:26,450
可以感觉到例如我的意思，稍后我们可能会看到一个例子
the mean field approximation yeah so you can feel for example I mean and we may

可以感觉到例如我的意思，稍后我们可能会看到一个例子
can feel for example I mean and we may see an example later on let's say this

956
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,210
可以感觉到例如我的意思，稍后我们可能会看到一个例子
see an example later on let's say this factorized distributions come to be a

957
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,910
在这个期望中，因式分解实际上成为高斯分布
see an example later on let's say this factorized distributions come to be a

958
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:36,140
在这个期望中，因式分解实际上成为高斯分布

959
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,150
在这个期望中，因式分解实际上成为高斯分布
Gaussian in essence in this expectation here you can think possibly that they

960
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:39,590
在这里您可以认为他们可能会在某些情况下出现
Gaussian in essence in this expectation here you can think possibly that they

961
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,680
在这里您可以认为他们可能会在某些情况下出现
here you can think possibly that they may come up that in certain cases what

962
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:42,690
在这里您可以认为他们可能会在某些情况下出现
may come up that in certain cases what you do is you may have to fix the

963
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,450
您要做的是，可能必须将结果固定为其平均值
may come up that in certain cases what you do is you may have to fix the

964
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:48,770
您要做的是，可能必须将结果固定为其平均值
you do is you may have to fix the results to their mean values right to

965
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:48,780
您要做的是，可能必须将结果固定为其平均值
results to their mean values right to their mean values

他们的平均值
results to their mean values right to their mean values

967
00:37:51,170 --> 00:38:02,260
我不这样认为我不这样认为
results to their mean values right to their mean values

968
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,270
我不这样认为我不这样认为


969
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:08,170
我不这样认为我不这样认为
I don't think so I don't think so

970
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:08,200
但我可以知道一种情况，即您在此处看到的内容之间存在关联
I don't think so I don't think so

but I can I know one case that there is a relation between what you see here

973
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,050
但我可以知道一种情况，即您在此处看到的内容之间存在关联
a relation between what you see here when you use particle approximations but

1053
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:46,040
在太空中，最佳Q线是正常qrz，因此这意味着最佳
qrz one so this now means optimal it is the expectation whatever value was

1054
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,830
期望值更高，这里Z 2没有隐藏的身体
qrz one so this now means optimal it is the expectation whatever value was

no I'm like I said Foursquare and somebody sent to complete the square I

1097
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:19,040
不，我就像说过Foursquare，有人派我去完成广场
somebody sent to complete the square I and I you know square square I left the

1098
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:26,660
我知道方形广场我离开了广场我要说的是关闭广场

know whatever so you basically have to write this you know the three - some

1104
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:39,470
写这个，你知道三个-先生的意思是对的。矩阵乘以D-Ameen
know whatever so you basically have to write this you know the three - some

1105
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:45,260
写这个，你知道三个-先生的意思是对的。矩阵乘以D-Ameen

00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,270
写这个，你知道三个-先生的意思是对的。矩阵乘以D-Ameen
mean right mr. matrix times D - Ameen all right so you can get the form of a

1107
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,210
好的，这样您就可以得到高斯分布的形式，您必须关闭
mean right mr. matrix times D - Ameen all right so you can get the form of a

1108
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,890
好的，这样您就可以得到高斯分布的形式，您必须关闭
all right so you can get the form of a Gaussian distribution you have to close

1109
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:48,900
好的，这样您就可以得到高斯分布的形式，您必须关闭
Gaussian distribution you have to close the square on c1 okay so you can be

1110
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,400
c1上的正方形好吧，因此您可能会错过三位一体的阅读，如果

实际联系，但是这个问题我真的很喜欢它是解决问题的方法
I really like it is the fix point solution okay and so the fix point

1152
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:31,900
解决方案还可以，所以定点解决方案基本上在一天结束时
I really like it is the fix point solution okay and so the fix point

1153
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,749
解决方案还可以，所以定点解决方案基本上在一天结束时
solution okay and so the fix point solution basically at the end of the day

1154
00:45:34,749 --> 00:45:34,759
解决方案还可以，所以定点解决方案基本上在一天结束时
solution basically at the end of the day gives you the chances of you secure all

1155
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:37,499
让您有机会确保一切正常，所以当您进行迭代时，您可以
solution basically at the end of the day gives you the chances of you secure all

1156
00:45:37,499 --> 00:45:40,870
让您有机会确保一切正常，所以当您进行迭代时，您可以
gives you the chances of you secure all right so when you iterate this you can

1157
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:40,880
让您有机会确保一切正常，所以当您进行迭代时，您可以
right so when you iterate this you can do it but you know gives the answer okay

1158
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,569
做到这一点，但您知道给出的答案还可以，所以q1 z1的平均值实际上是新的
right so when you iterate this you can do it but you know gives the answer okay

1159
00:45:43,569 --> 00:45:47,680
做到这一点，但您知道给出的答案还可以，所以q1 z1的平均值实际上是新的
do it but you know gives the answer okay so the mean of q1 z1 is actually new one

1160
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:47,690
做到这一点，但您知道给出的答案还可以，所以q1 z1的平均值实际上是新的
so the mean of q1 z1 is actually new one and the you know the precision is lambda

1161
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:56,620
而您知道的精度是lambda 1 1，这里是Precision对
so the mean of q1 z1 is actually new one and the you know the precision is lambda

1162
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,809
而您知道的精度是lambda 1 1，这里是Precision对
and the you know the precision is lambda 1 1 and here the Precision's love with

1163
00:45:58,809 --> 00:45:58,819
而您知道的精度是lambda 1 1，这里是Precision对
1 1 and here the Precision's love with you too and I mean me too alright so

1164
00:45:58,819 --> 00:46:03,069
你也是，我的意思是我也很好，所以让我没有时间检查我
1 1 and here the Precision's love with you too and I mean me too alright so

1165
00:46:03,069 --> 00:46:07,120
你也是，我的意思是我也很好，所以让我没有时间检查我
you too and I mean me too alright so let's I do not have time to check I'm

1166
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,130
你也是，我的意思是我也很好，所以让我没有时间检查我
let's I do not have time to check I'm gonna post this right but there is a

1167
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,209
会发布此权利，但实际上存在有关问题的产品计划
let's I do not have time to check I'm gonna post this right but there is a

1168
00:46:09,209 --> 00:46:12,599
会发布此权利，但实际上存在有关问题的产品计划
gonna post this right but there is a product on problems actually the plan

1169
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:12,609
会发布此权利，但实际上存在有关问题的产品计划
product on problems actually the plan and get you the pixels of your seat here

1170
00:46:12,609 --> 00:46:15,729
并让您知道座位的像素，所以我将向您展示结果
product on problems actually the plan and get you the pixels of your seat here

1171
00:46:15,729 --> 00:46:19,569
并让您知道座位的像素，所以我将向您展示结果
and get you the pixels of your seat here so I'm gonna show you how the results

1172
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:19,579
并让您知道座位的像素，所以我将向您展示结果
so I'm gonna show you how the results look like so this is this is the

1173
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:24,519
看起来像这样，这就是多元的高斯变量
so I'm gonna show you how the results look like so this is this is the

1174
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:26,319
看起来像这样，这就是多元的高斯变量
look like so this is this is the multivariate Gaussian that to bivariate

1175
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:26,329
看起来像这样，这就是多元的高斯变量
multivariate Gaussian that to bivariate Gaussian P of Z and you try to

1176
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:28,479
Z的高斯P，您尝试用此因式近似
multivariate Gaussian that to bivariate Gaussian P of Z and you try to

1177
00:46:28,479 --> 00:46:31,809
Z的高斯P，您尝试用此因式近似
Gaussian P of Z and you try to approximate it with this factorized

1178
00:46:31,809 --> 00:46:31,819
Z的高斯P，您尝试用此因式近似
approximate it with this factorized variational distribution Q of Z alright

1179
00:46:31,819 --> 00:46:35,109
Z的变化分布Q好，所以请注意，所以这就是你
approximate it with this factorized variational distribution Q of Z alright

1180
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:41,289
Z的变化分布Q好，所以请注意，所以这就是你
variational distribution Q of Z alright so so notice okay so this is what you

1181
00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:41,299
Z的变化分布Q好，所以请注意，所以这就是你
so so notice okay so this is what you get all right so this is the product of

1182
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:45,160
没事，所以这是两个单变量高斯的乘积，您会注意到
so so notice okay so this is what you get all right so this is the product of

1183
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,549
没事，所以这是两个单变量高斯的乘积，您会注意到
get all right so this is the product of two univariate gaussians and you notice

1184
00:46:48,549 --> 00:46:48,559
没事，所以这是两个单变量高斯的乘积，您会注意到
two univariate gaussians and you notice that in in the direction of the maximal

1185
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,390
基本上是在Z的P的最大方差方向上
two univariate gaussians and you notice that in in the direction of the maximal

1186
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:54,130
基本上是在Z的P的最大方差方向上
that in in the direction of the maximal variance of P of Z basically your

1187
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:54,140
基本上是在Z的P的最大方差方向上
variance of P of Z basically your underestimate X okay so basically here

1188
00:46:54,140 --> 00:47:01,150
低估了X好吧，所以基本上您在这里做得很好，但是您知道自己在
variance of P of Z basically your underestimate X okay so basically here

1189
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,949
低估了X好吧，所以基本上您在这里做得很好，但是您知道自己在
underestimate X okay so basically here you're doing good but you know you're

1190
00:47:02,949 --> 00:47:02,959
低估了X好吧，所以基本上您在这里做得很好，但是您知道自己在
you're doing good but you know you're missing what's going on in there

1191
00:47:02,959 --> 00:47:06,280
缺少那里正在发生的事情，所以这基本上是支持
you're doing good but you know you're missing what's going on in there

1192
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,800
缺少那里正在发生的事情，所以这基本上是支持
missing what's going on in there so this is basically the support the

1193
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:08,810
缺少那里正在发生的事情，所以这基本上是支持
so this is basically the support the solution that you get this multiple path

1194
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:10,450
解决方案，您可以获得比Z的实际P多的路径，因此基本上
so this is basically the support the solution that you get this multiple path

1195
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,910
解决方案，您可以获得比Z的实际P多的路径，因此基本上
solution that you get this multiple path than the actual P of Z so basically your

1196
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:12,920
解决方案，您可以获得比Z的实际P多的路径，因此基本上
than the actual P of Z so basically your cube Z is over confident approximation

1197
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,760
立方体Z过度逼近过程
than the actual P of Z so basically your cube Z is over confident approximation

1198
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,580
立方体Z过度逼近过程
cube Z is over confident approximation of the procedure

1199
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:27,460

基本上与我给您的推导相同，我们在进行优化时会在此处看到
basically the same derivation I gave you I see here when we did the optimization

1205
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:39,230
基本上与我给您的推导相同，我们在进行优化时会在此处看到
I see here when we did the optimization problem and crossing the constrain but

1206
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:43,510
问题和克服约束，但分配的未来已规范化，因此
I see here when we did the optimization problem and crossing the constrain but

1207
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,910
问题和克服约束，但分配的未来已规范化，因此

00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:45,920
问题和克服约束，但分配的未来已规范化，因此
the distribution future is normalized so if you do absolutely this you get the

1209
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,079
如果您绝对做到这一点，那么您会立即获得正确的解决方案，因此
the distribution future is normalized so if you do absolutely this you get the

1210
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:49,420
如果您绝对做到这一点，那么您会立即获得正确的解决方案，因此

好吧，没关系，让我继续对


1216
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:01,390
好吧，没关系，让我继续对
okay it doesn't matter so let me continue this approximation of the

1217
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:01,400
好吧，没关系，让我继续对
continue this approximation of the Gaussian think this is what Winston's

1218
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,030
高斯认为这就是温斯顿的，我们现在还可以，所以我们提到了

00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:09,870
高斯认为这就是温斯顿的，我们现在还可以，所以我们提到了

1220
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:09,880
高斯认为这就是温斯顿的，我们现在还可以，所以我们提到了
we're getting okay so we mentioned that maximizing the lower bound right is the

1221
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,370
最大化下限右与最小化Cooper剪辑或
we're getting okay so we mentioned that maximizing the lower bound right is the

1222
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:14,260
最大化下限右与最小化Cooper剪辑或
maximizing the lower bound right is the same as minimizing the Cooper clip or

00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:14,270
最大化下限右与最小化Cooper剪辑或
same as minimizing the Cooper clip or distance between Q and P so it just to

1224
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:17,890
Q和P之间的距离，所以它只是使事情变得有趣，您知道我们
same as minimizing the Cooper clip or distance between Q and P so it just to

1225
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:21,490
Q和P之间的距离，所以它只是使事情变得有趣，您知道我们
distance between Q and P so it just to make things interesting you know what we

1226
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:21,500
Q和P之间的距离，所以它只是使事情变得有趣，您知道我们
make things interesting you know what we do here is promote instead of minimizing

1227
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,530
在这里做的是促进而不是最小化随之而来的Q和P之间的风险QM

do here is promote instead of minimizing risk QM between Q and P that comes

1229
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:26,480
在这里做的是促进而不是最小化随之而来的Q和P之间的风险QM
risk QM between Q and P that comes directly from the is a variation of

1230
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,270
如果我们尝试最小化，则直接来自原则的变体

the distance between P and Q for I can remember the cubot liberal distance is

1235
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:37,369
P和Q之间的距离，因为我记得立方机器人的自由距离是
remember the cubot liberal distance is not symmetric so you know anticipate

1236
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:39,430
不对称，所以您知道这将为您带来相同的结果

1238
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:40,940
不对称，所以您知道这将为您带来相同的结果
that this will give you the same results as this so this is the valuation

1239
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,490
因为这就是估值的近似值
that this will give you the same results as this so this is the valuation

1240
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:44,380
因为这就是估值的近似值
as this so this is the valuation approximation this is what were

1241
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:44,390
因为这就是估值的近似值
approximation this is what were discussing in this Q lectures this is

1242
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:47,410
在这个Q讲座中讨论，这不是变化近似

00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,030
在这个Q讲座中讨论，这不是变化近似
discussing in this Q lectures this is not a variation approximation we

1244
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:49,040
在这个Q讲座中讨论，这不是变化近似
not a variation approximation we minimize the KL distance between P and Q

1245
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,579
最小化P和Q之间的KL距离可以有很大的不同，所以这就是
not a variation approximation we minimize the KL distance between P and Q

1246
00:48:51,579 --> 00:48:54,099
最小化P和Q之间的KL距离可以有很大的不同，所以这就是
minimize the KL distance between P and Q all right big difference so this is what

1247
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:54,109
最小化P和Q之间的KL距离可以有很大的不同，所以这就是
all right big difference so this is what you get

1248
00:48:54,109 --> 00:48:55,410
你得到，所以K在这里看，所以Q就是全部
all right big difference so this is what you get

1249
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:58,420
你得到，所以K在这里看，所以Q就是全部
you get so K here look at the so the Q is all

1250
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,430
你得到，所以K在这里看，所以Q就是全部
so K here look at the so the Q is all over the space this is P of Z so P of Z

1251
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:01,720
在空间上，这是Z的P，所以Z的P是0，所以在立方体中，如果可以的话
so K here look at the so the Q is all over the space this is P of Z so P of Z

00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,200
在空间上，这是Z的P，所以Z的P是0，所以在立方体中，如果可以的话
over the space this is P of Z so P of Z is 0 there right so in cubes if you can

1253
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:05,210
在空间上，这是Z的P，所以Z的P是0，所以在立方体中，如果可以的话

very high support and non zero mass in areas for P of Z is equal to zero

1266
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,550
Z的P的面积等于零，因此再次确保写出

00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:30,680
在这里，所以这是一个多元高斯模型，所以如果您想这样做
Gaussian okay so if you want to do this you can use variational methods this is

1483
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,609
您可以使用变分方法这不是结果有很大不同
Gaussian okay so if you want to do this you can use variational methods this is

00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:40,500
一切正常，当一切不正常时，您可以内部化这K个
things work and when things don't work ok so you can internalize this K of

1515
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:40,510
一切正常，当一切不正常时，您可以内部化这K个
ok so you can internalize this K of distance to what's called the family of

1516
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:44,910
距离所谓的分歧家庭好
ok so you can internalize this K of distance to what's called the family of

1517
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:46,349
距离所谓的分歧家庭好
distance to what's called the family of divergence okay

1518
00:58:46,349 --> 00:58:46,359

divergence okay and this is the definition of this

1520
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:55,500
这就是这个距离的定义，它看起来像参数
and this is the definition of this distance with parameter right it looks

1521
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:55,510
这就是这个距离的定义，它看起来像参数
distance with parameter right it looks very much different from the KL distant

1522
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:57,900
与KL遥远的地区有很大的不同，所以这个问题是alpha为2减
distance with parameter right it looks very much different from the KL distant

1523
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,990
与KL遥远的地区有很大的不同，所以这个问题是alpha为2减
very much different from the KL distant okay so this problem is alpha is 2 minus

1524
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:01,000
与KL遥远的地区有很大的不同，所以这个问题是alpha为2减
okay so this problem is alpha is 2 minus R into infinity and it is obviously

1525
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,730
R变成无穷大，当P时，它明显大于或等于0等于0

type of extensions of the K of distance so the let me see if I need to tell you

1540
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,930
所以让我看看我是否需要在这里告诉你什么
type of extensions of the K of distance so the let me see if I need to tell you

1541
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:42,690
所以让我看看我是否需要在这里告诉你什么
so the let me see if I need to tell you anything here

1542
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:49,010
所以基本上我们接下来的两张幻灯片是向您展示一些限制
so the let me see if I need to tell you anything here

1543
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:49,020
所以基本上我们接下来的两张幻灯片是向您展示一些限制


1544
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:57,350
所以基本上我们接下来的两张幻灯片是向您展示一些限制
so basically we're having the next two slides is to show you some limiting

1545
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:57,360
所以基本上我们接下来的两张幻灯片是向您展示一些限制
slides is to show you some limiting values of this alpha distances when

1546
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:02,840
当Alpha将各种门移至一个时，该Alpha距离的值
slides is to show you some limiting values of this alpha distances when

01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:06,200
当Alpha将各种门移至一个时，该Alpha距离的值
values of this alpha distances when alpha takes various doors to one

1548
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:06,210
当Alpha将各种门移至一个时，该Alpha距离的值
alpha takes various doors to one basically what exactly you are getting

1549
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:08,060
基本上您会得到什么，因此，如果您定义此系数1
alpha takes various doors to one basically what exactly you are getting

1550
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:13,910
基本上您会得到什么，因此，如果您定义此系数1
basically what exactly you are getting and so if you define this coefficient 1

1551
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:13,920
基本上您会得到什么，因此，如果您定义此系数1
and so if you define this coefficient 1 plus alpha over the fewest gamma P and

1552
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,370
加上最小的伽玛P的alpha值，当伽玛Q出现时，该系数即为
and so if you define this coefficient 1 plus alpha over the fewest gamma P and

1553
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:19,520
加上最小的伽玛P的alpha值，当伽玛Q出现时，该系数即为
plus alpha over the fewest gamma P and this coefficient as gamma Q arise the

1554
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:19,530
加上最小的伽玛P的alpha值，当伽玛Q出现时，该系数即为
this coefficient as gamma Q arise the exponent of the Judis to be the Q

1555
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:21,260
Judis的指数是Q分布，显然是伽马P a伽马Q
this coefficient as gamma Q arise the exponent of the Judis to be the Q

1556
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:25,040
Judis的指数是Q分布，显然是伽马P a伽马Q
exponent of the Judis to be the Q distribution obviously gamma P a gamma Q

1557
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:25,050
Judis的指数是Q分布，显然是伽马P a伽马Q
distribution obviously gamma P a gamma Q equal to 1 so if you take the limit at

1558
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:28,540
等于1，所以当alpha达到1时，如果您在此gamez取极限，则可以
distribution obviously gamma P a gamma Q equal to 1 so if you take the limit at

1559
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:32,450
等于1，所以当alpha达到1时，如果您在此gamez取极限，则可以
equal to 1 so if you take the limit at this gamez when alpha goes to 1 you can

1560
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:32,460
等于1，所以当alpha达到1时，如果您在此gamez取极限，则可以
this gamez when alpha goes to 1 you can see this goes to zero this goes to 1 and

1561
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:36,290
看到它变成零，然后变成1，实际上你可以拿走
this gamez when alpha goes to 1 you can see this goes to zero this goes to 1 and

1562
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:40,070
看到它变成零，然后变成1，实际上你可以拿走
see this goes to zero this goes to 1 and what you can do is actually you can take

1563
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:40,080
看到它变成零，然后变成1，实际上你可以拿走
what you can do is actually you can take these powers in the definition of this

1564
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,230
这些力量在这个阿尔法距离的定义中，并首先使用
what you can do is actually you can take these powers in the definition of this

actually previous I'm not gonna go through everything here okay so for

1570
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:53,420
可以通过这里的所有内容，例如，如果您采用分布Q

01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:57,900
可以通过这里的所有内容，例如，如果您采用分布Q
example if you take the distribution Q to gamma Q you can write this as the

1573
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:03,200
对于伽玛Q，您可以将其写为Q的伽玛Q对数的指数，然后

goes to 0 as alpha goes to 1 so you can write this as exponential is 1 plus X

1581
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:19,800
变为0，而alpha变为1，因此您可以将其写为指数为1加X
write this as exponential is 1 plus X plus x squared over 2 so the first term

that maybe some of you have seen it in different contexts in machine learning

1593
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:44,100
也许你们中的一些人在机器学习的不同背景下看到了它
different contexts in machine learning so if you take this asymptotic value and

1594
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:49,250
因此，如果您采用这个渐近值，并且如果您得到的话，我们会将其插入其中
different contexts in machine learning so if you take this asymptotic value and

1595
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:52,430
因此，如果您采用这个渐近值，并且如果您得到的话，我们会将其插入其中
so if you take this asymptotic value and we plug them in there if you get

1596
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:52,440
因此，如果您采用这个渐近值，并且如果您得到的话，我们会将其插入其中
we plug them in there if you get basically you recover from the self of

1597
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,800
基本上，您可以从KL Vista的距离自我中恢复
we plug them in there if you get basically you recover from the self of

1598
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,840
基本上，您可以从KL Vista的距离自我中恢复
basically you recover from the self of distances the KL Vista

1599
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:56,850
基本上，您可以从KL Vista的距离自我中恢复
distances the KL Vista okay so as a matter fact when alpha we

1600
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:00,800
好吧，事实上，当我们从α出发时，右边的z / 2
distances the KL Vista okay so as a matter fact when alpha we

1601
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,390
好吧，事实上，当我们从α出发时，右边的z / 2
okay so as a matter fact when alpha we set out from goes to z/2 on right

1602
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:02,400
好吧，事实上，当我们从α出发时，右边的z / 2
set out from goes to z/2 on right without reverse to 1 this becomes equal

1603
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,090
如果没有倒数为1，则等于回答您获得距离K
set out from goes to z/2 on right without reverse to 1 this becomes equal

1604
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:07,460
如果没有倒数为1，则等于回答您获得距离K
without reverse to 1 this becomes equal to answer you get the K of distance okay

1605
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:07,470
如果没有倒数为1，则等于回答您获得距离K
to answer you get the K of distance okay and so this has some limiting values

1606
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:11,480
所以这有一些极限值，所以当Alpha最差的一个时，您会得到
to answer you get the K of distance okay and so this has some limiting values

1607
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,030
所以这有一些极限值，所以当Alpha最差的一个时，您会得到
and so this has some limiting values okay so when alpha worst one you get the

1608
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:14,040
所以这有一些极限值，所以当Alpha最差的一个时，您会得到
okay so when alpha worst one you get the KL distance and actually here yeah so

1609
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,210
KL距离，实际上在这里，是的，所以这是正确的，您可以得到相反的结果
okay so when alpha worst one you get the KL distance and actually here yeah so

1610
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:19,250
KL距离，实际上在这里，是的，所以这是正确的，您可以得到相反的结果
KL distance and actually here yeah so this correct and you can get the reverse

1611
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:19,260
KL距离，实际上在这里，是的，所以这是正确的，您可以得到相反的结果
this correct and you can get the reverse key and distance when alpha goes to

1612
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,570
关键点和距离，当alpha达到负1甚至更远时，您就可以离开
this correct and you can get the reverse key and distance when alpha goes to

01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,950
关键点和距离，当alpha达到负1甚至更远时，您就可以离开
key and distance when alpha goes to minus 1 in even further you can get out

1614
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:24,960
关键点和距离，当alpha达到负1甚至更远时，您就可以离开
minus 1 in even further you can get out of this

1615
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:25,790
这甚至香农给距离，但一些
minus 1 in even further you can get out of this

1616
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:28,970
这甚至香农给距离，但一些
of this even the Shannon give distance but some

1617
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:28,980
这甚至香农给距离，但一些
even the Shannon give distance but some people in network theory goes right so

1618
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,610
网络理论的人们正确无误，因此可以通过平等对待来恢复
even the Shannon give distance but some people in network theory goes right so

1619
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:34,790
网络理论的人们正确无误，因此可以通过平等对待来恢复
people in network theory goes right so this is recovered by taking after equal

1620
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:34,800
网络理论的人们正确无误，因此可以通过平等对待来恢复
this is recovered by taking after equal to 0

1621
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,160
到0
this is recovered by taking after equal to 0

1622
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:44,690
让我看看我是否要告诉你兄弟
this is recovered by taking after equal to 0

让我看看我是否要告诉你兄弟


1624
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:49,130
让我看看我是否要告诉你兄弟
let me see if I am going to tell you brothers

1625
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:55,370
对，所以我们说好吧，让我看看我们将如何定义这个问题，所以在
let me see if I am going to tell you brothers

1626

对，所以我们说好吧，让我看看我们将如何定义这个问题，所以在
right so let's say okay let me see how we're going to define this problem so in

1628
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:03,090
对，所以我们说好吧，让我看看我们将如何定义这个问题，所以在
we're going to define this problem so in everything we did like one will apply

1629
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:05,000
我们所做的一切都会应用期望最大化，对吗？
we're going to define this problem so in everything we did like one will apply

1630
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,430
我们所做的一切都会应用期望最大化，对吗？
everything we did like one will apply expectation maximization right do you

1631
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:07,440
我们所做的一切都会应用期望最大化，对吗？
expectation maximization right do you remember we had a set of latent variable

1632
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,260
记住我们有一组潜在变量Z但也有一组参数
expectation maximization right do you remember we had a set of latent variable

记住我们有一组潜在变量Z但也有一组参数
Z but also we have a set of parameters okay and in the expectation step what we

1635
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:18,380
好的，在期望步骤中，我们做了计算
Z but also we have a set of parameters okay and in the expectation step what we

1636
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:22,220
好的，在期望步骤中，我们做了计算
okay and in the expectation step what we did is we computed the efficient

1637
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:22,230
好的，在期望步骤中，我们做了计算
did is we computed the efficient statistics that they were effectively

1640
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:26,700
他们是Z的有效期望的统计数据
expectations with respect to the Z variable for fixed parameters and then

1641
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,090
变量以获取固定参数，然后我们就完成了足够的操作
expectations with respect to the Z variable for fixed parameters and then

1642
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:31,460
变量以获取固定参数，然后我们就完成了足够的操作

1643
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:31,470
变量以获取固定参数，然后我们就完成了足够的操作
we since we completed the sufficient statistics then we much mize all right

1644
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:41,360
统计数据，那么我们就可以很好地合并，这样我可以做一个身体星体
we since we completed the sufficient statistics then we much mize all right

1646
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:44,370
统计数据，那么我们就可以很好地合并，这样我可以做一个身体星体
so here can I do a body astral approximation what is not going to give

1647
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:46,490
近似，当联合分布的时候，什么不给我
so here can I do a body astral approximation what is not going to give

1648
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:49,370
近似，当联合分布的时候，什么不给我
approximation what is not going to give me when the Joint Distribution of the

1649
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:49,380
近似，当联合分布的时候，什么不给我
me when the Joint Distribution of the unknown Nathan variables Z and the

1650
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:51,020
未知的Nathan变量Z和theta受精的参数具有您所需要的

1652
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:53,880
未知的Nathan变量Z和theta受精的参数具有您所需要的
parameters theta fertilizes has what you see here I should have put there cure

1653
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,660
看到这里，我应该放那里治病，看看逗号逗号，如果现在
parameters theta fertilizes has what you see here I should have put there cure

1654
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:01,070
看到这里，我应该放那里治病，看看逗号逗号，如果现在
see here I should have put there cure see that comma theta all right now if

1655
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:01,080
看到这里，我应该放那里治病，看看逗号逗号，如果现在
see that comma theta all right now if you want to keep the the parameters

1656
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,350
您想将参数theta保持为固定值，然后
see that comma theta all right now if you want to keep the the parameters

1657
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:06,530
您想将参数theta保持为固定值，然后
you want to keep the the parameters theta to a fixed value all right and you

1658
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:06,540
您想将参数theta保持为固定值，然后
theta to a fixed value all right and you don't want to bother basically bistro3

1659
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,630
基本上不想打扰成为Delta函数的bistro3，好吧，
theta to a fixed value all right and you don't want to bother basically bistro3

1660
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:12,520
基本上不想打扰成为Delta函数的bistro3，好吧，
don't want to bother basically bistro3 that becomes a delta function okay and

1661
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:12,530
基本上不想打扰成为Delta函数的bistro3，好吧，
that becomes a delta function okay and so let's see what case this is

1662
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:16,490
所以让我们看看这里考虑什么情况
that becomes a delta function okay and so let's see what case this is

1663
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:22,400
所以让我们看看这里考虑什么情况
so let's see what case this is considered here so the maximization of

1664
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:22,410
所以让我们看看这里考虑什么情况
considered here so the maximization of the lower bound is the same as the

1665
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:24,980
下限与最小化qlp之间的距离相同
considered here so the maximization of the lower bound is the same as the

1666
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:27,020
下限与最小化qlp之间的距离相同
the lower bound is the same as the minimization of the distance between qlp

1667
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:27,030
下限与最小化qlp之间的距离相同
minimization of the distance between qlp so the distance between Q and P is

1668
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,960
所以Q和P之间的距离写成减去Z的theta Q的Q
minimization of the distance between qlp so the distance between Q and P is

1669
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:34,070
所以Q和P之间的距离写成减去Z的theta Q的Q
so the distance between Q and P is written minus Q of theta Q of Z this the

1670
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:34,080
所以Q和P之间的距离写成减去Z的theta Q的Q
written minus Q of theta Q of Z this the authorization I use this is the log of

1671
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,870
授权我使用的是联合日志的日志，可能您有ZQ theta
written minus Q of theta Q of Z this the authorization I use this is the log of

1672
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:39,200
授权我使用的是联合日志的日志，可能您有ZQ theta
authorization I use this is the log of joint log likelihood you have Z Q theta

1673
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:39,210
授权我使用的是联合日志的日志，可能您有ZQ theta
joint log likelihood you have Z Q theta just the definition okay so anyways if I

1674
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:50,000
只是定义好，所以无论如何，如果我说让我们固定参数的值
joint log likelihood you have Z Q theta just the definition okay so anyways if I

1675
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,100
只是定义好，所以无论如何，如果我说让我们固定参数的值
just the definition okay so anyways if I say let's fix the parameters the value

1676
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:52,110
只是定义好，所以无论如何，如果我说让我们固定参数的值
say let's fix the parameters the value theta 0 expectation step all right so

1677
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:57,250
theta 0期望值步骤可以正常执行，因此具有的期望值
say let's fix the parameters the value theta 0 expectation step all right so

1678
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,080
theta 0期望值步骤可以正常执行，因此具有的期望值
theta 0 expectation step all right so actually does the expectations that has

1679
01:04:59,080 --> 01:04:59,090
theta 0期望值步骤可以正常执行，因此具有的期望值
actually does the expectations that has anything to do with wanna show that

1680
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:01,360
想要表明正确的事情，所以我们要保留纸张
actually does the expectations that has anything to do with wanna show that

1681
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,300
想要表明正确的事情，所以我们要保留纸张
anything to do with wanna show that right so we're going to keep paper

1682
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:04,310
想要表明正确的事情，所以我们要保留纸张
right so we're going to keep paper tricks to 0 so the calculation that

1683
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:17,200
欺骗到0，所以计算基本上涉及那里的分子
right so we're going to keep paper tricks to 0 so the calculation that

1684
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,330
欺骗到0，所以计算基本上涉及那里的分子
tricks to 0 so the calculation that involves basically the numerator there

1685
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:19,340
欺骗到0，所以计算基本上涉及那里的分子
involves basically the numerator there all right theta is the Delta function so

1686
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:22,960
好的theta是Delta函数，所以您相信我会得到他们的帮助
involves basically the numerator there all right theta is the Delta function so

1687
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,800
好的theta是Delta函数，所以您相信我会得到他们的帮助
all right theta is the Delta function so you believe that I'm going to get their

1688
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:25,810
好的theta是Delta函数，所以您相信我会得到他们的帮助
you believe that I'm going to get their number physique of P of Z comma theta 0

1689
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:29,070
Z逗号theta的P的数字体0可以，但是基本上我们认为我们
you believe that I'm going to get their number physique of P of Z comma theta 0

1690
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:33,340
Z逗号theta的P的数字体0可以，但是基本上我们认为我们
number physique of P of Z comma theta 0 all right but basically we think that we

1691
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:33,350
Z逗号theta的P的数字体0可以，但是基本上我们认为我们
all right but basically we think that we don't really care because I am looking

1692
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:35,020
不太在乎，因为我向下看0日期3，所以这里减去Q of
all right but basically we think that we don't really care because I am looking

1693
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:38,560
不太在乎，因为我向下看0日期3，所以这里减去Q of
don't really care because I am looking down on 0 date 3 so out here minus Q of

1694
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:38,570
不太在乎，因为我向下看0日期3，所以这里减去Q of
down on 0 date 3 so out here minus Q of Z log of p 0 0 so minus P of Z ok some

1695
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:45,550
Z log of p 0 0所以减去Z的P可以一些思考
down on 0 date 3 so out here minus Q of Z log of p 0 0 so minus P of Z ok some

1696
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,290
Z log of p 0 0所以减去Z的P可以一些思考
Z log of p 0 0 so minus P of Z ok some thinking

1697
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:47,300
Z log of p 0 0所以减去Z的P可以一些思考
thinking here is the join little Hydra put this

1698
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,590
这是Hydra的小连接，这就是我们期望使用的
thinking here is the join little Hydra put this

1699
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:52,960
这是Hydra的小连接，这就是我们期望使用的
here is the join little Hydra put this is what we use in expectation

1700
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:52,970
这是Hydra的小连接，这就是我们期望使用的
is what we use in expectation maximization and I like this as the

1701
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:55,270
给定参数，我喜欢Z的后验
is what we use in expectation maximization and I like this as the

1702
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:58,270
给定参数，我喜欢Z的后验

1703
01:05:58,270 --> 01:05:58,280
给定参数，我喜欢Z的后验
posterior of Z given the parameters times the probability of theta 0 the

1704
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:01,750
乘以theta 0的概率，基本上是theta 0的后验
posterior of Z given the parameters times the probability of theta 0 the

1705
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,500
乘以theta 0的概率，基本上是theta 0的后验
times the probability of theta 0 the posterior of theta 0 basically

1706
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:04,510
乘以theta 0的概率，基本上是theta 0的后验
posterior of theta 0 basically okay so he just doesn't matter for this

1707
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:09,340
好吧，所以他只是没关系，我摆脱了它，所以减去Z的Q对数
posterior of theta 0 basically okay so he just doesn't matter for this

1708
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:12,430
好吧，所以他只是没关系，我摆脱了它，所以减去Z的Q对数
okay so he just doesn't matter for this I get rid of it so minus Q of Z log of

1709
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:12,440
好吧，所以他只是没关系，我摆脱了它，所以减去Z的Q对数
I get rid of it so minus Q of Z log of this divided by Q C ok and which is the

1710
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:18,340
这除以QC好，这是最小化，所以我们需要最小化
I get rid of it so minus Q of Z log of this divided by Q C ok and which is the

1711
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:21,970
这除以QC好，这是最小化，所以我们需要最小化
this divided by Q C ok and which is the the minimization so we need to minimize

1712
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:21,980
这除以QC好，这是最小化，所以我们需要最小化
the minimization so we need to minimize K this K of distance all right

1713
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:24,310
那么距离K这个距离就可以了吗？
the minimization so we need to minimize K this K of distance all right

1714
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:26,620
那么距离K这个距离就可以了吗？
K this K of distance all right all right so when is the minimization

1715
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:26,630
那么距离K这个距离就可以了吗？
all right so when is the minimization happening when Q of Z equal to P of Z

1716
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:30,610
给定theta 0逗号X时，Z的Q等于Z的P时发生的情况是
all right so when is the minimization happening when Q of Z equal to P of Z

1717
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:34,240
给定theta 0逗号X时，Z的Q等于Z的P时发生的情况是
happening when Q of Z equal to P of Z given theta 0 comma X this is what

1718
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:34,250
给定theta 0逗号X时，Z的Q等于Z的P时发生的情况是
given theta 0 comma X this is what actually we did from the expectation

1719
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:36,130
实际上，我们是从期望步骤开始的，我们固定了所有参数
given theta 0 comma X this is what actually we did from the expectation

1720
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:38,740
实际上，我们是从期望步骤开始的，我们固定了所有参数
actually we did from the expectation step right we fix the parameters all

1721
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:38,750
实际上，我们是从期望步骤开始的，我们固定了所有参数
step right we fix the parameters all right and you remember what we did this

1722
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,900
是的，您还记得我们所做的，我们计算了联接的平均值
step right we fix the parameters all right and you remember what we did this

1723
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,450
是的，您还记得我们所做的，我们计算了联接的平均值
right and you remember what we did this we computed the average of the join

1724
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:43,460
是的，您还记得我们所做的，我们计算了联接的平均值
we computed the average of the join locally with respect to the distribution

1725
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:47,290
关于分配本地
we computed the average of the join locally with respect to the distribution

1726
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:47,730
什么是分布，然后我们平均的步长是因为
we computed the average of the join locally with respect to the distribution

1727
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:47,740
什么是分布，然后我们平均的步长是因为


1728
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:53,230
什么是分布，然后我们平均的步长是因为
what was the distribution and then step that we averaged with because the

1729
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:53,240
什么是分布，然后我们平均的步长是因为
that we averaged with because the custodian of Z given the parameter ETA

1730
01:06:53,240 --> 01:07:00,850
给定参数ETA的Z的托管人是第一个
that we averaged with because the custodian of Z given the parameter ETA

1731
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:01,849
给定参数ETA的Z的托管人是第一个
custodian of Z given the parameter ETA is the first

1732
01:07:01,849 --> 01:07:01,859
给定参数ETA的Z的托管人是第一个
is the first she given because 0 so this step

1733
01:07:01,859 --> 01:07:05,809
她给出的是因为0，所以这一步实际上确实是因为它很小
is the first she given because 0 so this step

1734
01:07:05,809 --> 01:07:08,359
她给出的是因为0，所以这一步实际上确实是因为它很小
she given because 0 so this step actually does come from it's the small

1735
01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:08,369
她给出的是因为0，所以这一步实际上确实是因为它很小
actually does come from it's the small part of the variational methods okay

1736
01:07:08,369 --> 01:07:11,890
变分方法的一部分好吧，那么你可能会问我有一个最大化
actually does come from it's the small part of the variational methods okay

1737
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:15,440
变分方法的一部分好吧，那么你可能会问我有一个最大化
part of the variational methods okay then you may ask I have a maximization

1738
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:15,450
变分方法的一部分好吧，那么你可能会问我有一个最大化
then you may ask I have a maximization step well so so maybe now Q of Z equal

1739
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:21,920
步长很好，所以也许现在Z的Q等于那个，我们要计算Q theta
then you may ask I have a maximization step well so so maybe now Q of Z equal

1740
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,599
步长很好，所以也许现在Z的Q等于那个，我们要计算Q theta
step well so so maybe now Q of Z equal to that and we want to compute Q theta

1741
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:23,609
步长很好，所以也许现在Z的Q等于那个，我们要计算Q theta
to that and we want to compute Q theta shall we go back to again to the right

1742
01:07:23,609 --> 01:07:28,059
我们可以再回到右边吗，所以我们要记住
to that and we want to compute Q theta shall we go back to again to the right

1743
01:07:28,059 --> 01:07:31,279
我们可以再回到右边吗，所以我们要记住
shall we go back to again to the right okay so we remember if this Q theta Q of

1744
01:07:31,279 --> 01:07:31,289
我们可以再回到右边吗，所以我们要记住
okay so we remember if this Q theta Q of Z the giant everything data and announce

1833
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:46,900
只是为了使事物概括化，所以我要假设的第一件事
so the first thing I'm going to assume the prior so we're going to compute X

1834
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,800
先验的，所以我们要正确计算X，我们要计算
so the first thing I'm going to assume the prior so we're going to compute X

1835
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,270
先验的，所以我们要正确计算X，我们要计算
the prior so we're going to compute X right we want to compute what the

1836
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:51,280
先验的，所以我们要正确计算X，我们要计算
right we want to compute what the original image this if you have some

1837
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,520
原始图像，如果您有一些嘈杂的红色监视，则为大多数网络

1839
01:10:56,850 --> 01:10:56,860
原始图像，如果您有一些嘈杂的红色监视，则为大多数网络
noisy red surveillance most web denoising is so the primary are X I'm

1840
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:59,670
降噪是主要的X我将假设它有一个
noisy red surveillance most web denoising is so the primary are X I'm

01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:03,290
降噪是主要的X我将假设它有一个
denoising is so the primary are X I'm going to assume it will have an

1842
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:03,300
降噪是主要的X我将假设它有一个
going to assume it will have an exponential prominent distribution would

1843
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,430
指数突出分布将是e减去一些能量，并且

1845
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:09,580
指数突出分布将是e减去一些能量，并且
be e to the minus some energy and this energy functional I write it like that

1846
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,930
能源功能，我这样写，我记账
be e to the minus some energy and this energy functional I write it like that

1847
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:15,720
能源功能，我这样写，我记账
energy functional I write it like that where I account

1848
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:15,730
能源功能，我这样写，我记账
where I account interactions between neighbors so this

1849
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,750
邻居之间的互动，所以这有点像日记本，是一个嵌套模型
where I account interactions between neighbors so this

1850
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,000
邻居之间的互动，所以这有点像日记本，是一个嵌套模型
interactions between neighbors so this is sort of a journal is a nesting model

1851
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:21,010
邻居之间的互动，所以这有点像日记本，是一个嵌套模型
is sort of a journal is a nesting model okay so I put some weights between

1852
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:24,530
好吧，所以我在像素I和J之间放了一些权重，但唯一的考虑因素是
is sort of a journal is a nesting model okay so I put some weights between

1853
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:27,990
好吧，所以我在像素I和J之间放了一些权重，但唯一的考虑因素是
okay so I put some weights between pixels I and J but the only account for

1854
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:28,000
好吧，所以我在像素I和J之间放了一些权重，但唯一的考虑因素是
pixels I and J but the only account for this interaction science a if I and J is

1855
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,540
如果我和J无法互动，这是我的生意，所以这是
pixels I and J but the only account for this interaction science a if I and J is

1856
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:36,690
如果我和J无法互动，这是我的生意，所以这是
this interaction science a if I and J is unable okay so a business my so this is

1857
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:36,700
如果我和J无法互动，这是我的生意，所以这是
unable okay so a business my so this is a very standard way you know to

1858
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:40,700
您知道的一种非常标准的方式来介绍依赖关系
unable okay so a business my so this is a very standard way you know to

1859
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:45,750
您知道的一种非常标准的方式来介绍依赖关系
a very standard way you know to introduce basically the dependencies

1860
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:45,760
您知道的一种非常标准的方式来介绍依赖关系
introduce basically the dependencies between the X pixels okay so again there

1861
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,160
在X像素之间还可以，因此再次将区域文字用于-II
introduce basically the dependencies between the X pixels okay so again there

1862
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:52,740
在X像素之间还可以，因此再次将区域文字用于-II
between the X pixels okay so again there is a regional writing uses into the - II

1863
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:52,750
在X像素之间还可以，因此再次将区域文字用于-II
is a regional writing uses into the - II like it gives distribution and this is

1864
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:55,680
像它给人分配的感觉，这就是我的精力，让我们看看
is a regional writing uses into the - II like it gives distribution and this is

1865
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:58,230
像它给人分配的感觉，这就是我的精力，让我们看看
like it gives distribution and this is my energy and let's see what the

1866
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:58,240
像它给人分配的感觉，这就是我的精力，让我们看看
my energy and let's see what the likelihood is going to be like so the

1867
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,210
可能性将是这样，所以可能性是其I的x的进度
my energy and let's see what the likelihood is going to be like so the

1868
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:02,280
可能性将是这样，所以可能性是其I的x的进度
likelihood is going to be like so the likelihood is a progress of x for its I

1869
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:02,290
可能性将是这样，所以可能性是其I的x的进度
likelihood is a progress of x for its I right so it is the probability of Y

1870
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:04,200
对，所以它是给定XI的Y的概率，所以您可以想到这种情况
likelihood is a progress of x for its I right so it is the probability of Y

1871
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,080
对，所以它是给定XI的Y的概率，所以您可以想到这种情况
right so it is the probability of Y given X I so you can think of this sort

1872
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:07,090
对，所以它是给定XI的Y的概率，所以您可以想到这种情况
given X I so you can think of this sort of being a Gaussian with some describe

1873
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:10,110
是高斯人，有些描述噪音，所以我要做的就是写
given X I so you can think of this sort of being a Gaussian with some describe

1874
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:14,340
是高斯人，有些描述噪音，所以我要做的就是写
of being a Gaussian with some describe noise so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write

1875
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:14,350
是高斯人，有些描述噪音，所以我要做的就是写
noise so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write each of these terms to follow this

1876
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:17,940
每个遵循此格式的术语都进入了一些能量寿命
noise so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write each of these terms to follow this

每个遵循此格式的术语都进入了一些能量寿命
format is into some energy life all right

1879
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:22,500
是的，因为它是
format is into some energy life all right

1880
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,390
是的，因为它是
right so because it's products of

1881
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:24,400
是的，因为它是
so because it's products of Exponential's then I'm going to get the

1882
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,660
然后，我将得到所有指数之和的期望值。
so because it's products of Exponential's then I'm going to get the

1883
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:28,770

Exponential's then I'm going to get the expectation of the summation of all the

1884
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:28,780
然后，我将得到所有指数之和的期望值。
expectation of the summation of all the alarms and this allows can be Gaussian

1885
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:32,970
警报，这可以使它具有一些噪声，可以是高斯式，还可以

警报，这可以使它具有一些噪声，可以是高斯式，还可以
right with some noise step okay all right

1888
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,550
很容易
right with some noise step okay all right

1889
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:40,200
很容易
right easy

1890
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:40,210
很容易
easy if I compute the joint you know if you

1891
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:44,820
如果我计算出关节，您会知道您是否原谅组织或
easy if I compute the joint you know if you

1892
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:47,940

1893
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:47,950
如果我计算出关节，您会知道您是否原谅组织或
forgive the organization or the the posterior of X given Y I get e to the

1894
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:51,450
给定YI，X的后验得到e减去能量等于能量e 0

minus the energy equal the energy is e 0 minus restoration of audiologic ok so my

1897
01:12:55,690 --> 01:13:00,900
减去听觉恢复还可以，所以我在巨大日志中的精力可能是这样
minus the energy equal the energy is e 0 minus restoration of audiologic ok so my

1898
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:05,310
减去听觉恢复还可以，所以我在巨大日志中的精力可能是这样
minus restoration of audiologic ok so my energy in my giant log likelihood this

1899
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:05,320
减去听觉恢复还可以，所以我在巨大日志中的精力可能是这样
energy in my giant log likelihood this is what we need from the variational

1900
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,750
我们从变分方法中需要的是e到减去该能量，因此
energy in my giant log likelihood this is what we need from the variational

1901
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:18,560
我们从变分方法中需要的是e到减去该能量，因此
is what we need from the variational methods is e to the minus this energy so

1902
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:18,570
我们从变分方法中需要的是e到减去该能量，因此
methods is e to the minus this energy so multinational approximation now because

1903
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:21,360
现在进行跨国近似，因为这看起来很复杂，这是
methods is e to the minus this energy so multinational approximation now because

1904
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:51,630
现在进行跨国近似，因为这看起来很复杂，这是
multinational approximation now because this looks complicated ok in this is the

1905
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:57,320
因为要简化此计算，因为我要指数
multinational approximation now because this looks complicated ok in this is the

1906
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:57,330
因为要简化此计算，因为我要指数


1907
01:13:57,330 --> 01:14:37,080
因为要简化此计算，因为我要指数
because to simplify this calculation because an exponential I am going to

1908
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:37,090
因为要简化此计算，因为我要指数
because an exponential I am going to define

1909

定义
because an exponential I am going to define

1910
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:41,140
所以我没有把米饭放到这里，但是这是你可以想到的
because an exponential I am going to define

1911
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:41,150
所以我没有把米饭放到这里，但是这是你可以想到的


1912
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:47,200
所以我没有把米饭放到这里，但是这是你可以想到的
so I do not put the rice here right but this is you can think of this is the

1913
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:47,210
所以我没有把米饭放到这里，但是这是你可以想到的
this is you can think of this is the giant okay this is what it is okay so

1914
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:50,830
巨人好吧，这是可以的，所以在这种液体下的巨人就这样
this is you can think of this is the giant okay this is what it is okay so

1915
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:56,770
巨人好吧，这是可以的，所以在这种液体下的巨人就这样
giant okay this is what it is okay so the giant under that liquid is so the

1916
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:56,780
巨人好吧，这是可以的，所以在这种液体下的巨人就这样
the giant under that liquid is so the Journal article will disconnect this

1917
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:58,780
日记文章将断开此指数的连接以消失，它将
the giant under that liquid is so the Journal article will disconnect this

1918
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:03,330
日记文章将断开此指数的连接以消失，它将
Journal article will disconnect this exponential to disappear and it will be

1919
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:03,340
日记文章将断开此指数的连接以消失，它将
exponential to disappear and it will be there's a minus sign there so it will be

1920
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:08,399
那里有一个负号，所以它将是XI的总和
exponential to disappear and it will be there's a minus sign there so it will be

1921
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:12,160
那里有一个负号，所以它将是XI的总和
there's a minus sign there so it will be X I times the summation over the

1922
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:12,170
那里有一个负号，所以它将是XI的总和
X I times the summation over the neighborhoods of Na VI j xj all right

1923
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:15,820
Na VI j xj的街区好，再加上XI的Li这个人如此贪婪
X I times the summation over the neighborhoods of Na VI j xj all right

1924
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:20,410
Na VI j xj的街区好，再加上XI的Li这个人如此贪婪
neighborhoods of Na VI j xj all right plus Li of X I this person's so ravenous

1925
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:20,420
Na VI j xj的街区好，再加上XI的Li这个人如此贪婪
plus Li of X I this person's so ravenous I am writing the joint of liquid but

1926
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:23,830
我正在写液体的连接点，但是因为我有兴趣，只计算一下
plus Li of X I this person's so ravenous I am writing the joint of liquid but

1927
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:25,919
我正在写液体的连接点，但是因为我有兴趣，只计算一下
I am writing the joint of liquid but because I'm interested only calculate

1928
01:15:25,919 --> 01:15:25,929
我正在写液体的连接点，但是因为我有兴趣，只计算一下
because I'm interested only calculate one factor at the time I am making the

1929
01:15:25,929 --> 01:15:31,270
当时我正在使包含XI的术语成为一个因素
because I'm interested only calculate one factor at the time I am making the

1930
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:34,919
当时我正在使包含XI的术语成为一个因素
one factor at the time I am making the terms that contain X I nothing else

1931
01:15:34,919 --> 01:15:34,929
当时我正在使包含XI的术语成为一个因素
terms that contain X I nothing else so there's many other terms like there

1932
01:15:34,929 --> 01:15:37,959
所以还有很多其他术语，例如这里x的所有邻居都是实际的
terms that contain X I nothing else so there's many other terms like there

1933
01:15:37,959 --> 01:15:39,970
所以还有很多其他术语，例如这里x的所有邻居都是实际的
so there's many other terms like there is actual on here x all the neighbor

1934
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:39,980
所以还有很多其他术语，例如这里x的所有邻居都是实际的
is actual on here x all the neighbor selector I only want to see X I because

1935
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:43,859
选择器我只想看到XI，因为这实际上是我感兴趣的
is actual on here x all the neighbor selector I only want to see X I because

1936
01:15:43,859 --> 01:15:45,820
选择器我只想看到XI，因为这实际上是我感兴趣的
selector I only want to see X I because effectively this is what I'm interested

1937
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:45,830
选择器我只想看到XI，因为这实际上是我感兴趣的
effectively this is what I'm interested to to compute in in some iterative

1938
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:50,050
以某种迭代的方式进行计算，这样陪审团将很高兴
effectively this is what I'm interested to to compute in in some iterative

1939
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:52,660
以某种迭代的方式进行计算，这样陪审团将很高兴
to to compute in in some iterative manner so the jury will be happy who is

1940
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:52,670
以某种迭代的方式进行计算，这样陪审团将很高兴
manner so the jury will be happy who is this okay so all right nice distribution

1941
01:15:52,670 --> 01:16:01,300
这样就可以了，好的分配是您知道最优的对数
manner so the jury will be happy who is this okay so all right nice distribution

1942
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:05,229
这样就可以了，好的分配是您知道最优的对数
this okay so all right nice distribution is you know that the log of the optimal

1943
01:16:05,229 --> 01:16:05,239
这样就可以了，好的分配是您知道最优的对数
is you know that the log of the optimal right is remember it is the expectation

1944
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:11,950
正确是记住，这是对治愈的期望，这还不正确
is you know that the log of the optimal right is remember it is the expectation

1945
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:16,810
正确是记住，这是对治愈的期望，这还不正确
right is remember it is the expectation with the cures and here is not all right

1946
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:16,820
正确是记住，这是对治愈的期望，这还不正确
with the cures and here is not all right so the Qi is the expectation okay of X I

1947
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:22,600
所以齐是XI的期望值
with the cures and here is not all right so the Qi is the expectation okay of X I

1948
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:31,389
所以齐是XI的期望值
so the Qi is the expectation okay of X I times this where I substance that

1949
01:16:31,389 --> 01:16:32,070
因为齐期望这种伪装的指数
so the Qi is the expectation okay of X I times this where I substance that

1950
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:32,080
因为齐期望这种伪装的指数


1951
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:39,459
因为齐期望这种伪装的指数
because Qi is expectation of this disguise the exponential of the

1952
01:16:39,459 --> 01:16:39,469
因为齐期望这种伪装的指数
disguise the exponential of the expectation of this and what is the

1953
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:42,339
对此的期望以及XJ的期望是什么，因为二进制
disguise the exponential of the expectation of this and what is the

1954
01:16:42,339 --> 01:16:44,290
对此的期望以及XJ的期望是什么，因为二进制
expectation of this and what is the expectation of X J because the binary

1955
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:44,300
对此的期望以及XJ的期望是什么，因为二进制
expectation of X J because the binary variable

1956
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,189
在这个琐碎的事情中，男人是如此积极
expectation of X J because the binary variable

1957
01:16:46,189 --> 01:16:49,219
在这个琐碎的事情中，男人是如此积极
variable it's men so actively in this trivial

1958
01:16:49,219 --> 01:16:49,229
在这个琐碎的事情中，男人是如此积极
it's men so actively in this trivial model - you can try to access to that

1959
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:55,729
模型-您可以尝试很好地获取该平均值
it's men so actively in this trivial model - you can try to access to that

model - you can try to access to that average value very nice

1961
01:16:59,209 --> 01:16:59,219
模型-您可以尝试很好地获取该平均值
average value very nice all right you know extremely is the

1962
01:16:59,219 --> 01:17:02,509
好吧，您知道的完全是完成，因此您实际上不必
average value very nice all right you know extremely is the

1963
01:17:02,509 --> 01:17:05,149
好吧，您知道的完全是完成，因此您实际上不必
all right you know extremely is the completion so you don't really have to

1964
01:17:05,149 --> 01:17:05,159
好吧，您知道的完全是完成，因此您实际上不必
completion so you don't really have to calculate any sufficient statistics and

1965
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:07,489
计算您只需修复XA的任何足够的统计数据和复杂的期望
completion so you don't really have to calculate any sufficient statistics and

1966
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:12,529
计算您只需修复XA的任何足够的统计数据和复杂的期望
calculate any sufficient statistics and complicated expectations you just fix XA

1967
01:17:12,529 --> 01:17:12,539
计算您只需修复XA的任何足够的统计数据和复杂的期望
complicated expectations you just fix XA with the mean right because you need to

1968
01:17:12,539 --> 01:17:14,449
意思是正确的，因为您需要打破期望好吗
complicated expectations you just fix XA with the mean right because you need to

1969
01:17:14,449 --> 01:17:16,399
意思是正确的，因为您需要打破期望好吗
with the mean right because you need to break expectations okay

1970
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:16,409
意思是正确的，因为您需要打破期望好吗
break expectations okay and I want you to interests right but we

1971
