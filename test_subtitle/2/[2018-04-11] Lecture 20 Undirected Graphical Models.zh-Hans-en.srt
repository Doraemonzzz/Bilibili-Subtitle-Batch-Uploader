1
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,870
好的，我希望您能幸免于最近的两次演讲，并且我假设的主题是
all right I hope you survive the last two lectures and I'm assuming the topics

2
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:35,880
好的，我希望您能幸免于最近的两次演讲，并且我假设的主题是
two lectures and I'm assuming the topics that needed to be covered were covered

3
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,800
那些需要被掩盖的东西被掩盖了，所以我不是你知道我还没有收到
two lectures and I'm assuming the topics that needed to be covered were covered

4
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,170
那些需要被掩盖的东西被掩盖了，所以我不是你知道我还没有收到
that needed to be covered were covered so I'm not you know I have not received

5
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,180
那些需要被掩盖的东西被掩盖了，所以我不是你知道我还没有收到
so I'm not you know I have not received any note contrary to God so we have

6
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,090
任何与上帝背道而驰的音符，所以我们进行了准确的双重演讲，其中有些是
so I'm not you know I have not received any note contrary to God so we have

7
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,630
任何与上帝背道而驰的音符，所以我们进行了准确的双重演讲，其中有些是
any note contrary to God so we have accuracy dual lectures some of them are

8
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
任何与上帝背道而驰的音符，所以我们进行了准确的双重演讲，其中有些是
accuracy dual lectures some of them are they may sound a little review but

9
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,809
他们可能听起来有点评论，但希望我们会在
accuracy dual lectures some of them are they may sound a little review but

10
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:55,850
他们可能听起来有点评论，但希望我们会在
they may sound a little review but hopefully we will do some new things in

11
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:55,860
他们可能听起来有点评论，但希望我们会在
hopefully we will do some new things in between and today I want to just go back

12
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,820
从今天开始，我只想回到直接的图形模型，因为
hopefully we will do some new things in between and today I want to just go back

13
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,460
从今天开始，我只想回到直接的图形模型，因为
between and today I want to just go back to a directly graphical models because

14
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:01,470
从今天开始，我只想回到直接的图形模型，因为
to a directly graphical models because basically they are the graphical models

15
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,610
基本上，它们是对科学更重要的图形模型
to a directly graphical models because basically they are the graphical models

16
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,809
基本上，它们是对科学更重要的图形模型
basically they are the graphical models of more importance for scientific

17
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:08,819
基本上，它们是对科学更重要的图形模型
of more importance for scientific applications okay so we need to to cover

18
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,740
应用程序还可以，所以我们需要详细介绍一些内容，提醒您不要
of more importance for scientific applications okay so we need to to cover

19
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,960
应用程序还可以，所以我们需要详细介绍一些内容，提醒您不要
applications okay so we need to to cover a few things in details reminder not

20
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:17,970
应用程序还可以，所以我们需要详细介绍一些内容，提醒您不要
a few things in details reminder not next week next next week all the

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,009
下个礼拜下个礼拜
a few things in details reminder not next week next next week all the

22
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:23,870
下个礼拜下个礼拜
next week next next week all the presentations in the class are going to

23
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:23,880
下个礼拜下个礼拜
presentations in the class are going to start and I'm gonna be randomly picking

24
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,320
开始，我要随机选择名字，我们是说你和你
presentations in the class are going to start and I'm gonna be randomly picking

25
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,289
开始，我要随机选择名字，我们是说你和你
start and I'm gonna be randomly picking names and we're saying you you and you

26
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:30,299
开始，我要随机选择名字，我们是说你和你
names and we're saying you you and you today you you tomorrow

27
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:32,360
今天，你明天就可以了，所以不要发送给我，
names and we're saying you you and you today you you tomorrow

28
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,270
今天，你明天就可以了，所以不要发送给我，
today you you tomorrow okay so don't send me in the quest and

29
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
今天，你明天就可以了，所以不要发送给我，
okay so don't send me in the quest and say please can I speak the last can I do

30
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,610
请说，我可以说最后一句话，我可以这样做吗，我可以做到吗，你知道，我认为
okay so don't send me in the quest and say please can I speak the last can I do

31
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:42,140
请说，我可以说最后一句话，我可以这样做吗，我可以做到吗，你知道，我认为
say please can I speak the last can I do this can I do that you know and I think

32
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,150
请说，我可以说最后一句话，我可以这样做吗，我可以做到吗，你知道，我认为
this can I do that you know and I think your presentations it will be useful if

33
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,319
您的演示文稿将非常有用，如果您在实际讲话前一天
this can I do that you know and I think your presentations it will be useful if

34
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:50,660
您的演示文稿将非常有用，如果您在实际讲话前一天
your presentations it will be useful if you a day before you actually speak the

35
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:50,670
您的演示文稿将非常有用，如果您在实际讲话前一天
you a day before you actually speak the the papers we can make them to be view

36
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,690
我们可以使它们基本上在学期末就可以发表的论文，所以
you a day before you actually speak the the papers we can make them to be view

37
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,310
我们可以使它们基本上在学期末就可以发表的论文，所以
the papers we can make them to be view basically at the end of the semester so

38
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:55,320
我们可以使它们基本上在学期末就可以发表的论文，所以
basically at the end of the semester so that's where you have a few more weeks

39
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,680
那是您还有几周的时间可以写出实际的六页，但是
basically at the end of the semester so that's where you have a few more weeks

40
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,710
那是您还有几周的时间可以写出实际的六页，但是
that's where you have a few more weeks to write the actual six pages okay but

41
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
那是您还有几周的时间可以写出实际的六页，但是
to write the actual six pages okay but there's no point of giving a

42
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,539
没有演讲的必要，然后说，请参阅修改
to write the actual six pages okay but there's no point of giving a

43
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:04,520
没有演讲的必要，然后说，请参阅修改
there's no point of giving a presentation then say please see revise

44
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:04,530
没有演讲的必要，然后说，请参阅修改
presentation then say please see revise presentation of course if the

45
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,400
如果演示文稿和论文不同意，当然可以进行演示
presentation then say please see revise presentation of course if the

46
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,370
如果演示文稿和论文不同意，当然可以进行演示
presentation of course if the presentation and the paper don't agree

47
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:10,380
如果演示文稿和论文不同意，当然可以进行演示
presentation and the paper don't agree in content we're in trouble

48
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,370
在内容上我们有麻烦了，所以基本上不要打扰
presentation and the paper don't agree in content we're in trouble

49
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,020
在内容上我们有麻烦了，所以基本上不要打扰
in content we're in trouble okay so don't bother basically

50
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,030
在内容上我们有麻烦了，所以基本上不要打扰
okay so don't bother basically submitting them if they are not on the

51
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,420
如果它们不在同一频率上提交，则提交它们
okay so don't bother basically submitting them if they are not on the

52
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,620
如果它们不在同一频率上提交，则提交它们
submitting them if they are not on the same on the same frequency

53
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:21,680
现在下周是科学会议，我不会在这里我有一个主意
submitting them if they are not on the same on the same frequency

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:21,690
现在下周是科学会议，我不会在这里我有一个主意


55
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,780
现在下周是科学会议，我不会在这里我有一个主意
now next week is the scientific meeting I am NOT going to be here I have an idea

56
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:27,790
现在下周是科学会议，我不会在这里我有一个主意
I am NOT going to be here I have an idea it's avec is going to be here so we may

57
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,290
avec将会在这里，所以如果我参加的话，我们可能会在星期五上课
I am NOT going to be here I have an idea it's avec is going to be here so we may

58
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,230
avec将会在这里，所以如果我参加的话，我们可能会在星期五上课
it's avec is going to be here so we may have a lecture on Friday if I make it on

59
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
avec将会在这里，所以如果我参加的话，我们可能会在星期五上课
have a lecture on Friday if I make it on time but for sure I'm not here Tuesday

60
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,930
时间，但是可以肯定的是，我星期二和星期四不在这里
have a lecture on Friday if I make it on time but for sure I'm not here Tuesday

61
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,380
时间，但是可以肯定的是，我星期二和星期四不在这里
time but for sure I'm not here Tuesday and Thursday okay

62
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:50,120
所以实际上，这可能是不止一次的演讲，我不会
time but for sure I'm not here Tuesday and Thursday okay

63
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,130
所以实际上，这可能是不止一次的演讲，我不会


64
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,070
所以实际上，这可能是不止一次的演讲，我不会
so actually for this would be most probably more than one lecture I don't

65
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,080
所以实际上，这可能是不止一次的演讲，我不会
probably more than one lecture I don't know how much we're going to cover today

66
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,550
知道今天我们要支付三场讲座的价格，但是
probably more than one lecture I don't know how much we're going to cover today

67
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,930
知道今天我们要支付三场讲座的价格，但是
know how much we're going to cover today the price for three lectures but the

68
00:04:59,930 --> 00:04:59,940
知道今天我们要支付三场讲座的价格，但是
the price for three lectures but the thing I don't have that luxury strong a

69
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,610
我所没有的那种奢侈使这座宫殿最多举办了两次讲座
the price for three lectures but the thing I don't have that luxury strong a

70
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,230
我所没有的那种奢侈使这座宫殿最多举办了两次讲座
thing I don't have that luxury strong a maximum of two lectures this palace

71
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
我所没有的那种奢侈使这座宫殿最多举办了两次讲座
maximum of two lectures this palace it's after nineteen from reqtest book

72
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,210
是从reqtest书中读到的19点之后，还从中传授了7个拼写
maximum of two lectures this palace it's after nineteen from reqtest book

73
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,020
是从reqtest书中读到的19点之后，还从中传授了7个拼写
it's after nineteen from reqtest book and also taught the spelling seven from

74
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,030
是从reqtest书中读到的19点之后，还从中传授了7个拼写
and also taught the spelling seven from colors and Friedman PGM book okay so

75
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:16,480
颜色和Friedman PGM都可以，所以它们都非常出色
and also taught the spelling seven from colors and Friedman PGM book okay so

76
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,490
颜色和Friedman PGM都可以，所以它们都非常出色
colors and Friedman PGM book okay so they're both excellent reached all right

77
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:19,500
颜色和Friedman PGM都可以，所以它们都非常出色
they're both excellent reached all right and as I said for those in who work in

78
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,100
正如我对那些从事科学和工程工作的人说的那样，
they're both excellent reached all right and as I said for those in who work in

79
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,170
正如我对那些从事科学和工程工作的人说的那样，
and as I said for those in who work in science and engineering this is a very

80
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:24,180
正如我对那些从事科学和工程工作的人说的那样，
science and engineering this is a very relevant topic so we may give you

81
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,080
相关主题，以便我们可以为您提供基本的指导，我们将尽力
science and engineering this is a very relevant topic so we may give you

82
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,930
相关主题，以便我们可以为您提供基本的指导，我们将尽力
relevant topic so we may give you basically minders and we'll try to to

83
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:32,940
相关主题，以便我们可以为您提供基本的指导，我们将尽力
basically minders and we'll try to to revisit a few concepts so what you see

84
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,690
重新审视一些概念，因此您在顶部看到的是定向的示例
basically minders and we'll try to to revisit a few concepts so what you see

85
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,120
重新审视一些概念，因此您在顶部看到的是定向的示例
revisit a few concepts so what you see on the top is an example of a directed

86
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,130
重新审视一些概念，因此您在顶部看到的是定向的示例
on the top is an example of a directed graph right and on the bottom we see an

87
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,120
右图，在底部，我们看到了该图的无向版本
on the top is an example of a directed graph right and on the bottom we see an

88
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,060
右图，在底部，我们看到了该图的无向版本
graph right and on the bottom we see an undirected version of this where you

89
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,070
右图，在底部，我们看到了该图的无向版本
undirected version of this where you notice we have done what with the

90
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,220
注意我们用流行语做了什么
undirected version of this where you notice we have done what with the

91
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,850
注意我们用流行语做了什么
notice we have done what with the buzzword what it is

92
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:51,860
注意我们用流行语做了什么
buzzword what it is modernization so we have moralized the

93
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,680
现代化，所以我们已经道德化了措辞，例如，七有三
buzzword what it is modernization so we have moralized the

94
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,310
现代化，所以我们已经道德化了措辞，例如，七有三
modernization so we have moralized the parlance so for example seven has three

95
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,320
现代化，所以我们已经道德化了措辞，例如，七有三
parlance so for example seven has three parents right and you notice four five

96
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,440
父母权利，你会注意到四个五和六个
parlance so for example seven has three parents right and you notice four five

97
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,040
父母权利，你会注意到四个五和六个
parents right and you notice four five and six

98
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,050
父母权利，你会注意到四个五和六个
and six basically we linked them similarly five

99
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,950
基本上我们将它们链接起来类似，五个有两个父母两个和三个，我们
and six basically we linked them similarly five

100
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,150
基本上我们将它们链接起来类似，五个有两个父母两个和三个，我们
basically we linked them similarly five has two parents two and three and we

101
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
基本上我们将它们链接起来类似，五个有两个父母两个和三个，我们
has two parents two and three and we made them now we will say that when you

102
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,240
现在使他们成为现实，我们会说，当您动员时，这绝不意味着
has two parents two and three and we made them now we will say that when you

103
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,120
现在使他们成为现实，我们会说，当您动员时，这绝不意味着
made them now we will say that when you mobilize it doesn't by any way imply

104
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,130
现在使他们成为现实，我们会说，当您动员时，这绝不意味着
mobilize it doesn't by any way imply that whatever conditioning dependence

105
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,810
无论顶部条件图的条件依赖关系如何
mobilize it doesn't by any way imply that whatever conditioning dependence

106
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,520
无论顶部条件图的条件依赖关系如何
that whatever conditioning dependence relationship for the graph on the top

107
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:19,530
无论顶部条件图的条件依赖关系如何
relationship for the graph on the top you are going to have the same relations

108
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,050
您将在底部的图形上具有相同的关系，这可以
relationship for the graph on the top you are going to have the same relations

109
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,960
您将在底部的图形上具有相同的关系，这可以
you are going to have the same relations on the graph on the bottom and this can

110
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:23,970
您将在底部的图形上具有相同的关系，这可以
on the graph on the bottom and this can be an issue I mean it's easier to work

111
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,450
是一个问题，我的意思是正确使用此模型更容易，今天，我们
on the graph on the bottom and this can be an issue I mean it's easier to work

112
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,640
是一个问题，我的意思是正确使用此模型更容易，今天，我们
be an issue I mean it's easier to work with this model right and today we're

113
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:28,650
是一个问题，我的意思是正确使用此模型更容易，今天，我们
with this model right and today we're actually going to be talking about

114
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,920
实际上将要谈论无向图，所以有一个
with this model right and today we're actually going to be talking about

115
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,500
实际上将要谈论无向图，所以有一个
actually going to be talking about undirected graphs okay so there is a

116
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:33,510
实际上将要谈论无向图，所以有一个
undirected graphs okay so there is a merit to do this but you need to be

117
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,660
这样做是值得的，但是您需要知道，但是这里的条件关系
undirected graphs okay so there is a merit to do this but you need to be

118
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,150
这样做是值得的，但是您需要知道，但是这里的条件关系
merit to do this but you need to be aware but the conditional relations here

119
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
这样做是值得的，但是您需要知道，但是这里的条件关系
aware but the conditional relations here they are not the same as the ops on the

120
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,620
它们与底部的操作并不总是一样，所以为什么我们不这样做
aware but the conditional relations here they are not the same as the ops on the

121
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,580
它们与底部的操作并不总是一样，所以为什么我们不这样做
they are not the same as the ops on the bottom not always all right so why do we

122
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:43,590
它们与底部的操作并不总是一样，所以为什么我们不这样做
bottom not always all right so why do we need to understand undirected graphical

123
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,580
需要了解无向的图形模型，这里只是一个例子
bottom not always all right so why do we need to understand undirected graphical

124
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,110
需要了解无向的图形模型，这里只是一个例子
need to understand undirected graphical models there is just example

125
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,120
需要了解无向的图形模型，这里只是一个例子
models there is just example think

126
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,490
考虑知识的时间越长
models there is just example think

127
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,180
考虑知识的时间越长
think about the the knowledge the longer

128
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,190
考虑知识的时间越长
about the the knowledge the longer variables in your graph let's say the

129
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,090
图表中的变量假设图像中没有形成的像素体
about the the knowledge the longer variables in your graph let's say the

130
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,930
图表中的变量假设图像中没有形成的像素体
variables in your graph let's say the pixel bodies in an image it doesn't make

131
00:06:59,930 --> 00:06:59,940
图表中的变量假设图像中没有形成的像素体
pixel bodies in an image it doesn't make a sense to actually put directions with

132
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,990
实际为我们指示方向的选举是一种形象的权利
pixel bodies in an image it doesn't make a sense to actually put directions with

133
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,970
实际为我们指示方向的选举是一种形象的权利
a sense to actually put directions with us the elections being an image right

134
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:04,980
实际为我们指示方向的选举是一种形象的权利
us the elections being an image right the this pixel effects is the parent of

135
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,210
该像素效果是该像素的父元素，这就是我们的大小
us the elections being an image right the this pixel effects is the parent of

136
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,700
该像素效果是该像素的父元素，这就是我们的大小
the this pixel effects is the parent of that pixel and that is the size of our

137
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:10,710
该像素效果是该像素的父元素，这就是我们的大小
that pixel and that is the size of our picture what does that mean it doesn't

138
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,530
想像一下这意味着什么并不意味着什么，所以我们只是没有
that pixel and that is the size of our picture what does that mean it doesn't

139
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,880
想像一下这意味着什么并不意味着什么，所以我们只是没有
picture what does that mean it doesn't mean anything so we only there's no

140
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:15,890
想像一下这意味着什么并不意味着什么，所以我们只是没有
mean anything so we only there's no meaning to actually use a direct

141
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,960
实际使用直接图形模型的含义是
mean anything so we only there's no meaning to actually use a direct

142
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,300
实际使用直接图形模型的含义是
meaning to actually use a direct graphical model it's a in the context of

143
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,310
实际使用直接图形模型的含义是
graphical model it's a in the context of famous analysis and more importantly

144
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,670
著名的分析，更重要的是，在如此庞大的分析中使用它无关紧要
graphical model it's a in the context of famous analysis and more importantly

145
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,330
著名的分析，更重要的是，在如此庞大的分析中使用它无关紧要
famous analysis and more importantly it's not relevant to use it in this huge

146
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:26,340
著名的分析，更重要的是，在如此庞大的分析中使用它无关紧要
it's not relevant to use it in this huge field of special statistics okay you

147
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,540
特殊统计领域好吧，您必须尝试在以下方面对相关性进行建模
it's not relevant to use it in this huge field of special statistics okay you

148
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,600
特殊统计领域好吧，您必须尝试在以下方面对相关性进行建模
field of special statistics okay you have to be try to model correlations in

149
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:32,610
特殊统计领域好吧，您必须尝试在以下方面对相关性进行建模
have to be try to model correlations in a special domain so I'll give you an

150
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,510
一个特殊的领域，所以我给你举一个例子，并基本上说明

152
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:38,970
一个特殊的领域，所以我给你举一个例子，并基本上说明
example and to indicate basically how different things can be between

153
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,720
有向图模型和无向图模型之间可以有不同的事物
example and to indicate basically how different things can be between

154
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,700
有向图模型和无向图模型之间可以有不同的事物
different things can be between directed graphical models and undirected

155
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:43,710
有向图模型和无向图模型之间可以有不同的事物
directed graphical models and undirected graphical model so let's go sit right on

156
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,140
图形化模型，让我们马上就坐吧，这是您可以想到的
directed graphical models and undirected graphical model so let's go sit right on

157
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,220
图形化模型，让我们马上就坐吧，这是您可以想到的
graphical model so let's go sit right on no date okay so this is you can think of

158
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,230
图形化模型，让我们马上就坐吧，这是您可以想到的
no date okay so this is you can think of this as an image and this have the pixel

159
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,770
这作为图像，并且具有正确的像素值，我们认为它们是
no date okay so this is you can think of this as an image and this have the pixel

160
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,570
这作为图像，并且具有正确的像素值，我们认为它们是
this as an image and this have the pixel values right which we take them to be

161
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:56,580
这作为图像，并且具有正确的像素值，我们认为它们是
values right which we take them to be rondo and let's say we put some arrows

162
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,610
回旋曲，让我们说出一些箭头，以确保您获得所有年级的分数
values right which we take them to be rondo and let's say we put some arrows

163
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,320
回旋曲，让我们说出一些箭头，以确保您获得所有年级的分数
rondo and let's say we put some arrows the way that you secure all this grade

164
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,330
回旋曲，让我们说出一些箭头，以确保您获得所有年级的分数
the way that you secure all this grade okay so we look on node X a can you tell

165
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,180
好吧，所以我们看一下节点X a，你能告诉我看一下所有的移植物吗？
the way that you secure all this grade okay so we look on node X a can you tell

166
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,600
好吧，所以我们看一下节点X a，你能告诉我看一下所有的移植物吗？
okay so we look on node X a can you tell me just looking at this graft all of

167
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:08,610
好吧，所以我们看一下节点X a，你能告诉我看一下所有的移植物吗？
me just looking at this graft all of this other knowledge that you see there

168
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,360
您在那边看到的其他知识他们做什么是可以的
me just looking at this graft all of this other knowledge that you see there

169
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,490
您在那边看到的其他知识他们做什么是可以的
this other knowledge that you see there all together what are they what do can

170
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:13,500
您在那边看到的其他知识他们做什么是可以的
all together what are they what do can we assign them a name in the context of

171
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,980
我们在节点X a和Y的上下文中为它们分配一个名称，因此
all together what are they what do can we assign them a name in the context of

172
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,840
我们在节点X a和Y的上下文中为它们分配一个名称，因此
we assign them a name in the context of the node X a and Y so it's very

173
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:20,850
我们在节点X a和Y的上下文中为它们分配一个名称，因此
the node X a and Y so it's very carefully all of this knows by the sound

174
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,590
仔细地通过兴奋的声音知道所有这些，当然Mira可以看到
the node X a and Y so it's very carefully all of this knows by the sound

175
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,080
仔细地通过兴奋的声音知道所有这些，当然Mira可以看到
carefully all of this knows by the sound excited except of course Mira can see

176
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,090
仔细地通过兴奋的声音知道所有这些，当然Mira可以看到
excited except of course Mira can see here x2 right it isn't an all together

177
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,920
在这里，x2对x8的上下文不是一个整体
excited except of course Mira can see here x2 right it isn't an all together

178
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,330
在这里，x2对x8的上下文不是一个整体
here x2 right it isn't an all together what are they in the context of x8

179
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:35,490
使毯子好吧，所以市场包括父母包括
here x2 right it isn't an all together what are they in the context of x8

180
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:35,500
使毯子好吧，所以市场包括父母包括


181
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:43,920
使毯子好吧，所以市场包括父母包括
the make a blanket okay so the market includes the parents includes the

182
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:43,930
使毯子好吧，所以市场包括父母包括
includes the parents includes the children and what our x12 and explore

183
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,790
孩子们，我们的x12和探索公司行不行
includes the parents includes the children and what our x12 and explore

184
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,690
孩子们，我们的x12和探索公司行不行
children and what our x12 and explore the corporates okay

185
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:50,700
孩子们，我们的x12和探索公司行不行
the corporates okay obviously is not included right so the

186
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,310
显然不包括在内，所以马尔可夫毯子的想法显然是
the corporates okay obviously is not included right so the

187
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,410
显然不包括在内，所以马尔可夫毯子的想法显然是
obviously is not included right so the idea obviously of the Markov blanket is

188
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:55,420
显然不包括在内，所以马尔可夫毯子的想法显然是
idea obviously of the Markov blanket is that we know the values of the Markov

189
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,940
我们知道这个Novak的Markov毯的值是然后提取的
idea obviously of the Markov blanket is that we know the values of the Markov

190
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,740
我们知道这个Novak的Markov毯的值是然后提取的
that we know the values of the Markov blanket of this Novak's a then extract

191
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:04,750
我们知道这个Novak的Markov毯的值是然后提取的
blanket of this Novak's a then extract is conditionally independent of anything

192
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,510
有条件地独立于地面上的其他任何东西，所以很明显，我们
blanket of this Novak's a then extract is conditionally independent of anything

193
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:11,010
有条件地独立于地面上的其他任何东西，所以很明显，我们
is conditionally independent of anything else in the ground okay so obviously we

194
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,020
有条件地独立于地面上的其他任何东西，所以很明显，我们
else in the ground okay so obviously we have to look very carefully on all this

195
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,820
必须非常仔细地查看所有网格，然后说是的，这就是马尔可夫
else in the ground okay so obviously we have to look very carefully on all this

196
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,610
必须非常仔细地查看所有网格，然后说是的，这就是马尔可夫
have to look very carefully on all this grid here to say yes this is the Markov

197
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:17,620
必须非常仔细地查看所有网格，然后说是的，这就是马尔可夫
grid here to say yes this is the Markov blanket but x2 is not included the x14

198
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,490
毯子，但不包括x2，不包括x14好的，现在让我们看一下
grid here to say yes this is the Markov blanket but x2 is not included the x14

199
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,380
毯子，但不包括x2，不包括x14好的，现在让我们看一下
blanket but x2 is not included the x14 is not included okay so let's look now

200
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:25,390
毯子，但不包括x2，不包括x14好的，现在让我们看一下
is not included okay so let's look now the undirected graph the Markov blanket

201
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:30,510
无向图的马尔可夫毯只是邻居的四个节点
is not included okay so let's look now the undirected graph the Markov blanket

202
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,410
无向图的马尔可夫毯只是邻居的四个节点
the undirected graph the Markov blanket is only those four nodes the neighbors

203
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:34,420
无向图的马尔可夫毯只是邻居的四个节点
is only those four nodes the neighbors because you remember conditional

204
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,500
因为您记得条件独立性基本上是在无方向的情况下
is only those four nodes the neighbors because you remember conditional

205
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,940
因为您记得条件独立性基本上是在无方向的情况下
because you remember conditional independence basically in an undirected

206
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:38,950
因为您记得条件独立性基本上是在无方向的情况下
independence basically in an undirected graph is defined by the neighbor so if

207
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,150
图是由邻居定义的，因此，如果您描述这些值
independence basically in an undirected graph is defined by the neighbor so if

208
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,410
图是由邻居定义的，因此，如果您描述这些值
graph is defined by the neighbor so if you describe the values of these

209
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:43,420
图是由邻居定义的，因此，如果您描述这些值
you describe the values of these neighbors right x8 is independent

210
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,870
邻居对x8是独立的，因为如果你看这个
you describe the values of these neighbors right x8 is independent

211
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,120
邻居对x8是独立的，因为如果你看这个
neighbors right x8 is independent anything else because if you look this

212
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,130
邻居对x8是独立的，因为如果你看这个
anything else because if you look this if you think of this operation the graph

213
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,060
如果您想到此操作，则图表将从激发到您拥有的任何其他节点
anything else because if you look this if you think of this operation the graph

214
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,310
如果您想到此操作，则图表将从激发到您拥有的任何其他节点
if you think of this operation the graph from excited to any other node you have

215
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:53,320
如果您想到此操作，则图表将从激发到您拥有的任何其他节点
from excited to any other node you have to go through this neighbors this Markov

216
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
穿过这个马尔可夫毯子的邻居，如果观察到
from excited to any other node you have to go through this neighbors this Markov

217
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,500
穿过这个马尔可夫毯子的邻居，如果观察到
to go through this neighbors this Markov blanket and and and if this are observed

218
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:58,510
穿过这个马尔可夫毯子的邻居，如果观察到
blanket and and and if this are observed got blocked okay so point is this

219
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:05,360
被阻止好了，所以这是在这种情况下的独立性关系
blanket and and and if this are observed got blocked okay so point is this

220
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,620
被阻止好了，所以这是在这种情况下的独立性关系
got blocked okay so point is this condition independence relations in the

221
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:07,630
被阻止好了，所以这是在这种情况下的独立性关系
condition independence relations in the context of undirected graphs are very

222
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,980
无向图的上下文比您看到的要简单得多
condition independence relations in the context of undirected graphs are very

223
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,130
无向图的上下文比您看到的要简单得多
context of undirected graphs are very simpler than what you see with a

224
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:14,140
无向图的上下文比您看到的要简单得多
simpler than what you see with a directed graph so obviously there is a

225
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,960
有向图，所以很明显有一个可以与无向图一起工作的优点
simpler than what you see with a directed graph so obviously there is a

226
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,140
有向图，所以很明显有一个可以与无向图一起工作的优点
directed graph so obviously there is a merit to actually work with undirected

227
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,150
有向图，所以很明显有一个可以与无向图一起工作的优点
merit to actually work with undirected graphs so if you want SQ advantages and

228
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:25,530
图，所以如果您想要SQ的优点和缺点，那么无向图
merit to actually work with undirected graphs so if you want SQ advantages and

229
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:30,390
图，所以如果您想要SQ的优点和缺点，那么无向图
graphs so if you want SQ advantages and disadvantages so the undirected graphs

230
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:30,400
图，所以如果您想要SQ的优点和缺点，那么无向图
disadvantages so the undirected graphs have symmetric you noticed when you look

231
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,120
具有对称性，您在寻找邻居时注意到了
disadvantages so the undirected graphs have symmetric you noticed when you look

232
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,280
具有对称性，您在寻找邻居时注意到了
have symmetric you noticed when you look for example for the neighbors is not

233
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,290
具有对称性，您在寻找邻居时注意到了
for example for the neighbors is not like this is the father

234
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,750
像这样的父亲是没有诺里亚主义的，这是孩子
for example for the neighbors is not like this is the father

235
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,700
像这样的父亲是没有诺里亚主义的，这是孩子
like this is the father there is norian tation this is the kids

236
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:38,710
像这样的父亲是没有诺里亚主义的，这是孩子
there is norian tation this is the kids we start the comparison you don't have

237
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,860
我们开始比较，您没有像这样的东西
there is norian tation this is the kids we start the comparison you don't have

238
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,520
我们开始比较，您没有像这样的东西
we start the comparison you don't have anything like that

239
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:41,530
我们开始比较，您没有像这样的东西
anything like that everything allowed to know the symmetric

240
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,000
一切都允许知道对称的好吧，所以在特殊情况下
anything like that everything allowed to know the symmetric

241
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,310
一切都允许知道对称的好吧，所以在特殊情况下

284
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
归一化，直接图形模型不是这种情况，因此
direct graphical models so the normalization requires actually to work

285
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,860
规范化实际上需要使用所有地方的所有点击，并且

287
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:11,970
规范化实际上需要使用所有地方的所有点击，并且
with all the clicks everywhere and that is a very computationally difficult

288
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,660
是一个非常困难的计算问题，实际上大多数

293
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,050
算法的困难仅在于正确地计算
because of computing properly the normalization factor

294
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,100
归一化因子
because of computing properly the normalization factor

295
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,330
所以在无向图中，我们基本上唯一的条件关系
because of computing properly the normalization factor

296
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:27,340
所以在无向图中，我们基本上唯一的条件关系


297
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:38,380
所以在无向图中，我们基本上唯一的条件关系
so in an undirected graphs the only conditional relation that we basically

298
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:38,390
所以在无向图中，我们基本上唯一的条件关系
conditional relation that we basically have played with is what you see here

299
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,960
您在这里看到的是用分隔定义的，所以X a是
conditional relation that we basically have played with is what you see here

300
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,170
您在这里看到的是用分隔定义的，所以X a是
have played with is what you see here defined with the separation so X a is

301
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:44,180
您在这里看到的是用分隔定义的，所以X a是
defined with the separation so X a is independent of X B given X C right when

302
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,420
当从xa到xb的任何电源必须使用时，独立于XB的XC权利
defined with the separation so X a is independent of X B given X C right when

303
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,210
当从xa到xb的任何电源必须使用时，独立于XB的XC权利
independent of X B given X C right when any power from x-a to x-b has to go

304
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:52,220
当从xa到xb的任何电源必须使用时，独立于XB的XC权利
any power from x-a to x-b has to go through XC okay and this is what we call

305
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,820
通过XC好吧，这就是我们所说的正常市场产权，因此
any power from x-a to x-b has to go through XC okay and this is what we call

306
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,080
通过XC好吧，这就是我们所说的正常市场产权，因此
through XC okay and this is what we call a normal market property right so for

307
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,090
通过XC好吧，这就是我们所说的正常市场产权，因此
a normal market property right so for example if you look at nodes 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 6 &amp;

308
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,440
例如，如果您查看节点1＆2＆6＆7
a normal market property right so for example if you look at nodes 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 6 &amp;

309
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:02,920
例如，如果您查看节点1＆2＆6＆7
example if you look at nodes 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 7

310
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:02,930
例如，如果您查看节点1＆2＆6＆7
7 they're conditionally independent from I

311
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,790
它们有条件地独立于我的意思是1 2＆6 7或加法无关
7 they're conditionally independent from I

312
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,040
它们有条件地独立于我的意思是1 2＆6 7或加法无关
they're conditionally independent from I mean 1 2 &amp; 6 7 or addition independent

313
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,050
它们有条件地独立于我的意思是1 2＆6 7或加法无关
mean 1 2 &amp; 6 7 or addition independent given 3 4 &amp; 5

314
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,970
给定3 4＆5，因为从一或二变为六或
mean 1 2 &amp; 6 7 or addition independent given 3 4 &amp; 5

315
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,180
给定3 4＆5，因为从一或二变为六或
given 3 4 &amp; 5 because to go from one or two to six or

316
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,190
给定3 4＆5，因为从一或二变为六或
because to go from one or two to six or seven you every part has to grow through

317
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,760
七个，您的每个部分都必须通过3 5＆4成长，这就是全球马尔可夫
because to go from one or two to six or seven you every part has to grow through

318
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,850
七个，您的每个部分都必须通过3 5＆4成长，这就是全球马尔可夫
seven you every part has to grow through 3 5 &amp; 4 so that's the global Markov

319
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:18,860
七个，您的每个部分都必须通过3 5＆4成长，这就是全球马尔可夫
3 5 &amp; 4 so that's the global Markov property the these geometrical property

320
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:25,360
这些几何特性基本上是根据
3 5 &amp; 4 so that's the global Markov property the these geometrical property

321
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,740
这些几何特性基本上是根据
property the these geometrical property is basically defined in terms of the

322
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:29,750
这些几何特性基本上是根据
is basically defined in terms of the immediate neighbors of a node so if you

323
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,530
节点的直接邻居，因此，如果修复它们的直接邻居，
is basically defined in terms of the immediate neighbors of a node so if you

324
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,360
节点的直接邻居，因此，如果修复它们的直接邻居，
immediate neighbors of a node so if you fix their immediate neighbors that's the

325
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,370
节点的直接邻居，因此，如果修复它们的直接邻居，
fix their immediate neighbors that's the Markov blanket basically this node

326
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,060
马尔可夫毯子基本上使该节点与另一个节点分离
fix their immediate neighbors that's the Markov blanket basically this node

327
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,220
马尔可夫毯子基本上使该节点与另一个节点分离
Markov blanket basically this node becomes separated from where the other

328
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,230
马尔可夫毯子基本上使该节点与另一个节点分离
becomes separated from where the other nodes okay so this is the local property

329
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,680
节点好，所以这是本地属性，因此您只需查看
becomes separated from where the other nodes okay so this is the local property

330
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,310
节点好，所以这是本地属性，因此您只需查看
nodes okay so this is the local property so you just look at the nodes of of the

331
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:45,320
节点好，所以这是本地属性，因此您只需查看
so you just look at the nodes of of the neighbors of the node and then there is

332
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,530
节点的邻居，然后就可以了，所以这是一个例子
so you just look at the nodes of of the neighbors of the node and then there is

333
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:56,650
节点的邻居，然后就可以了，所以这是一个例子
neighbors of the node and then there is ok so here's one example one is so

334
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:56,660
节点的邻居，然后就可以了，所以这是一个例子
ok so here's one example one is so different or three one is independent of

335
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,020
不同或三个独立于另一节点好
ok so here's one example one is so different or three one is independent of

336
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,520
不同或三个独立于另一节点好
different or three one is independent of the other node all right

337
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:00,530
不同或三个独立于另一节点好
the other node all right because again 23 are the neighbors of

338
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,940
因为23再一次是有趣的邻居，一旦您阻止了他们，就没有路可走
the other node all right because again 23 are the neighbors of

339
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,100
因为23再一次是有趣的邻居，一旦您阻止了他们，就没有路可走
because again 23 are the neighbors of fun once you block them there is no path

340
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,110
因为23再一次是有趣的邻居，一旦您阻止了他们，就没有路可走
fun once you block them there is no path to go from 1 to any corrupt and and then

341
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,690
从1变到任何腐败，然后您有这个瘫痪的Markov属性
fun once you block them there is no path to go from 1 to any corrupt and and then

342
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,940
从1变到任何腐败，然后您有这个瘫痪的Markov属性
to go from 1 to any corrupt and and then you have this paralyzed Markov property

343
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:12,950
从1变到任何腐败，然后您有这个瘫痪的Markov属性
you have this paralyzed Markov property all right

344
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,140
好吧，如果是的话，如果是的话，你的邻居也这样
you have this paralyzed Markov property all right

345
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:22,890
好吧，如果是的话，如果是的话，你的邻居也这样
all right so if so if yes again your neighbors so

346
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:22,900
好吧，如果是的话，如果是的话，你的邻居也这样
so if so if yes again your neighbors so financial condition independent given

347
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,150
财务状况独立于其他因素（如果没有直接优势）
so if so if yes again your neighbors so financial condition independent given

348
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,070
财务状况独立于其他因素（如果没有直接优势）
financial condition independent given the rest if there is not direct edge

349
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,080
财务状况独立于其他因素（如果没有直接优势）
the rest if there is not direct edge between them okay

350
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,230
他们之间好记是有条件依赖的
the rest if there is not direct edge between them okay

351
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,299
他们之间好记是有条件依赖的

352
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:32,309
他们之间好记是有条件依赖的
notes are conditionally dependent given the rest right if there's no s between

353
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:36,980
其余的，如果它们之间不存在，您能坐下来吗？
notes are conditionally dependent given the rest right if there's no s between

354
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,189
其余的，如果它们之间不存在，您能坐下来吗？
the rest right if there's no s between them can you sit up I mean if the amount

355
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:40,199
其余的，如果它们之间不存在，您能坐下来吗？
them can you sit up I mean if the amount of dissipation is so let's say I'm

356
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,759
耗散是这么说的，我正在看注6 8和X 9以及所有
them can you sit up I mean if the amount of dissipation is so let's say I'm

357
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,030
耗散是这么说的，我正在看注6 8和X 9以及所有
of dissipation is so let's say I'm looking at the note 6 8 and X 9 and all

358
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
耗散是这么说的，我正在看注6 8和X 9以及所有
looking at the note 6 8 and X 9 and all the other notes of things all right

359
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,009
一切正常的其他注释显然，从X 8 X 9可以找到一条路径
looking at the note 6 8 and X 9 and all the other notes of things all right

360
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:53,960
一切正常的其他注释显然，从X 8 X 9可以找到一条路径
the other notes of things all right obviously there is a path from X 8 X 9

361
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:53,970
一切正常的其他注释显然，从X 8 X 9可以找到一条路径
obviously there is a path from X 8 X 9 on this plot all right so the only way

362
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,689
在这个情节上好吧，所以如果有的话，您可以使它独立的唯一方法
obviously there is a path from X 8 X 9 on this plot all right so the only way

363
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,189
在这个情节上好吧，所以如果有的话，您可以使它独立的唯一方法
on this plot all right so the only way you can make this independent if there

364
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:58,199
在这个情节上好吧，所以如果有的话，您可以使它独立的唯一方法
you can make this independent if there is no link and that's why this is called

365
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,079
是没有链接，这就是为什么这被称为成对的markov属性，所以对于
you can make this independent if there is no link and that's why this is called

366
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,139
是没有链接，这就是为什么这被称为成对的markov属性，所以对于
is no link and that's why this is called a pairwise markov property so for

367
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:03,149
是没有链接，这就是为什么这被称为成对的markov属性，所以对于
a pairwise markov property so for example is X 7 X 13th independent given

368
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:07,939
例子是X 7 X 13独立，给定其他所有条件是X 7和X 13

these pairwise and the local property they're all equivalent so if you start

379
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,320
它们都是等效的，所以如果您从头开始，可以看到其他两个不是

remember this for example the explaining away and the undirected version that

404
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:37,410
离开，看起来像这样的无向版本，所以例如
away and the undirected version that looks like that okay so so for example

405
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:37,420
离开，看起来像这样的无向版本，所以例如
looks like that okay so so for example on this graph right with this separation

406
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,530
在这张图上，这种分离描述了从A没有路径
looks like that okay so so for example on this graph right with this separation

七个精氨酸26的裤子，让我们在这种情况下使它们处于这种状态
the pants of seven arginine 26 there's let's make them in this condition in the

487
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:22,030
惩罚四个和六个，然后这个有条件的独立关系
the pants of seven arginine 26 there's let's make them in this condition in the

488
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,040
惩罚四个和六个，然后这个有条件的独立关系


489
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,590
惩罚四个和六个，然后这个有条件的独立关系
penalizing four and six and then this conditional independence relationship

490
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
惩罚四个和六个，然后这个有条件的独立关系
conditional independence relationship that we have on the Left will also be a

491
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,510
我们在左侧也将是一个街区，所以这是您需要做的
conditional independence relationship that we have on the Left will also be a

492
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,230
我们在左侧也将是一个街区，所以这是您需要做的
that we have on the Left will also be a block so here's what you need to do if

493
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,240
我们在左侧也将是一个街区，所以这是您需要做的
block so here's what you need to do if you want to prove a conditional

494
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,030
你想证明条件独立性，如果你说现在支付和B
block so here's what you need to do if you want to prove a conditional

495
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,820
你想证明条件独立性，如果你说现在支付和B
you want to prove a conditional independence if you say now pay and B

496
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:37,830
你想证明条件独立性，如果你说现在支付和B
independence if you say now pay and B given C you only kid so you started off

497
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:45,290
给定C，你是唯一的孩子，所以你从小马开始就表示一个B和C，
independence if you say now pay and B given C you only kid so you started off

498
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,540
给定C，你是唯一的孩子，所以你从小马开始就表示一个B和C，
given C you only kid so you started off the pony has denotes a B and C that we

499
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:47,550
给定C，你是唯一的孩子，所以你从小马开始就表示一个B和C，
the pony has denotes a B and C that we have okay all right and then you can

500
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:54,890
没事吧，然后您可以搜索您知道的特殊情况
the pony has denotes a B and C that we have okay all right and then you can

501
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,760
没事吧，然后您可以搜索您知道的特殊情况
have okay all right and then you can search on you know particular case

502
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,500
当然，六点和七点不存在，所以实际上不需要知道
have okay all right and then you can search on you know particular case

503
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:02,510
当然，六点和七点不存在，所以实际上不需要知道


504
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:10,400
当然，六点和七点不存在，所以实际上不需要知道
certainly six and seven is not there so there's no need to actually you know to

505
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,410
当然，六点和七点不存在，所以实际上不需要知道
there's no need to actually you know to put six and seven in the picture at all

506
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,500
好吧，在图片中放置六个和七个，所以我们没有六个和七个
there's no need to actually you know to put six and seven in the picture at all

507
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,480
好吧，在图片中放置六个和七个，所以我们没有六个和七个
put six and seven in the picture at all alright so we don't have any six and

508
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:14,490
好吧，在图片中放置六个和七个，所以我们没有六个和七个
alright so we don't have any six and seven so so if you can see that if you

509
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,990
七个，所以如果您可以看到，如果您对此进行分析，那么这种关系就是
alright so we don't have any six and seven so so if you can see that if you

510
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,080
七个，所以如果您可以看到，如果您对此进行分析，那么这种关系就是
seven so so if you can see that if you analyze this all right this relation is

511
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,090
七个，所以如果您可以看到，如果您对此进行分析，那么这种关系就是
analyze this all right this relation is actually true it's not the case given to

512
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,970
确实是这样，不是可以对笔进行反抗，所以
analyze this all right this relation is actually true it's not the case given to

513
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:31,370
确实是这样，不是可以对笔进行反抗，所以
actually true it's not the case given to be exploring the pen defied all right so

514
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:31,380
确实是这样，不是可以对笔进行反抗，所以
be exploring the pen defied all right so so again if you restrain yourself on the

515
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,050
再说一次，如果您在这种情况下约束祖先图
be exploring the pen defied all right so so again if you restrain yourself on the

516
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,050
再说一次，如果您在这种情况下约束祖先图
so again if you restrain yourself on the ancestral graph alright in this case

517
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,060
再说一次，如果您在这种情况下约束祖先图
ancestral graph alright in this case this beginning of a B and C you can

518
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,140
B和C的开始，您可以保持条件依赖
ancestral graph alright in this case this beginning of a B and C you can

519
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,850
B和C的开始，您可以保持条件依赖
this beginning of a B and C you can maintain the conditional dependence

520
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:43,860
B和C的开始，您可以保持条件依赖

00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,099
分布所隐含的选举，我们还定义了一个完美的地图，因此
graph for subsets of the independent elections implied by the distribution

531
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:11,269
分布所隐含的选举，我们还定义了一个完美的地图，因此
elections implied by the distribution and we also define a perfect map so

532
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:11,279
分布所隐含的选举，我们还定义了一个完美的地图，因此
and we also define a perfect map so Jason Patric monopoly distribution if I

533
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:13,399
如果我的J等于P的I，那么Jason Patric的垄断分布
and we also define a perfect map so Jason Patric monopoly distribution if I

如果我的J等于P的I，那么Jason Patric的垄断分布
Jason Patric monopoly distribution if I have J equal to I of P the message here

535
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:16,739
如果我的J等于P的I，那么Jason Patric的垄断分布
have J equal to I of P the message here is that the directed and undirected

536
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:18,469
是有向图和无向图是完美的Maps基本上是四个
have J equal to I of P the message here is that the directed and undirected

537
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:22,129
是有向图和无向图是完美的Maps基本上是四个
is that the directed and undirected graphs are perfect Maps basically four

538
00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:22,139
是有向图和无向图是完美的Maps基本上是四个
graphs are perfect Maps basically four different sets of distributions okay so

539
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:27,579
可以使用不同的分布集，所以从这个意义上说，它们功能强大，但
graphs are perfect Maps basically four different sets of distributions okay so

540
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,799
可以使用不同的分布集，所以从这个意义上说，它们功能强大，但
different sets of distributions okay so in this sense they are powerful but

541
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:30,809
可以使用不同的分布集，所以从这个意义上说，它们功能强大，但
in this sense they are powerful but basically they're pretty mental of each

542
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,589
基本上，他们彼此之间或者我彼此大陆性很强
in this sense they are powerful but basically they're pretty mental of each

543
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:35,690
基本上，他们彼此之间或者我彼此大陆性很强
basically they're pretty mental of each other or I continentally of each other

544
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:35,700
基本上，他们彼此之间或者我彼此大陆性很强
other or I continentally of each other so let me give you an example I think it

545
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:41,450
所以让我举一个例子，我认为这是在大选初期，但是我们
other or I continentally of each other so let me give you an example I think it

546
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,779
所以让我举一个例子，我认为这是在大选初期，但是我们
so let me give you an example I think it was this was in an early election but we

547
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:43,789
所以让我举一个例子，我认为这是在大选初期，但是我们
was this was in an early election but we make an effort to avoid discussion of

548
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:46,729
尽力避免讨论细节，所以让我们考虑一下
was this was in an early election but we make an effort to avoid discussion of

549
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:48,919
尽力避免讨论细节，所以让我们考虑一下
make an effort to avoid discussion of the details so let's consider this

550
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:48,929
尽力避免讨论细节，所以让我们考虑一下
the details so let's consider this undirected graph all right and can you

551
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:52,879
无向图可以，您能给我一些独立的陈述吗？
the details so let's consider this undirected graph all right and can you

552
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:54,589
无向图可以，您能给我一些独立的陈述吗？
undirected graph all right and can you give me some independent statements on

553
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:54,599
无向图可以，您能给我一些独立的陈述吗？
give me some independent statements on this graph simply by looking at this

554
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:58,820
只需查看此操作即可查看该图
give me some independent statements on this graph simply by looking at this

555
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,249
只需查看此操作即可查看该图
this graph simply by looking at this operation

556
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:03,370
所以这是独立的，独立条件说给定它们将是什么
this graph simply by looking at this operation

557
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:03,380
所以这是独立的，独立条件说给定它们将是什么


558
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:09,039
所以这是独立的，独立条件说给定它们将是什么
so what it is independent the condition independent said given what they'll be

559
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:09,049
所以这是独立的，独立条件说给定它们将是什么
independent said given what they'll be because every math is blocked by DMV and

560
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:11,919
因为每个数学都被DMV阻止，并且类似地，我们的条件
independent said given what they'll be because every math is blocked by DMV and

561
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,560
因为每个数学都被DMV阻止，并且类似地，我们的条件
because every math is blocked by DMV and similarly there'd be our condition

562
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:14,570
因为每个数学都被DMV阻止，并且类似地，我们的条件
similarly there'd be our condition dependent given agency so the position

563
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,110
依赖给定的代理机构，所以有人可能会问到的职位是很多基本的
similarly there'd be our condition dependent given agency so the position

564
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:21,010
依赖给定的代理机构，所以有人可能会问到的职位是很多基本的
dependent given agency so the position that someone may ask is this many basic

565
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,020
依赖给定的代理机构，所以有人可能会问到的职位是很多基本的
that someone may ask is this many basic to go that in quotes exactly the same

566
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,740
用引用完全相同的独立关系表示这一努力
that someone may ask is this many basic to go that in quotes exactly the same

567
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,880
用引用完全相同的独立关系表示这一努力
to go that in quotes exactly the same independence relation says this endeavor

568
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:29,890
用引用完全相同的独立关系表示这一努力
independence relation says this endeavor the answer is you can't all right the

569
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,799
答案是你不能很好，答案是“否”，当我在这里演示时
independence relation says this endeavor the answer is you can't all right the

is two examples you can try as many as you want

574
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
有两个示例，您可以尝试任意多
you want design this directed graph so this we

575
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,169
设计这个有向图，所以我们可以说a和C是独立的
you want design this directed graph so this we

576
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:50,140
设计这个有向图，所以我们可以说a和C是独立的
design this directed graph so this we can say that a and C are independent

577
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,150
设计这个有向图，所以我们可以说a和C是独立的
can say that a and C are independent given baby that's nice

578
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,549
给婴儿一个很好的你不应该好吧，所以精力
can say that a and C are independent given baby that's nice

579
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:57,029
给婴儿一个很好的你不应该好吧，所以精力
given baby that's nice you should not okay so the energy

580
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,039
给婴儿一个很好的你不应该好吧，所以精力
you should not okay so the energy independent given B and D which is the

581
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,860
给定的B和D与思想相同，但让我们看一下
you should not okay so the energy independent given B and D which is the

582
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,440
给定的B和D与思想相同，但让我们看一下
independent given B and D which is the same as thought but let's look at the

583
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:02,450
给定的B和D与思想相同，但让我们看一下
same as thought but let's look at the northern relation of actually is implied

584
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,330
假设B和D为
same as thought but let's look at the northern relation of actually is implied

585
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,230
假设B和D为
northern relation of actually is implied by this graph given a B and D are

586
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,240
假设B和D为
by this graph given a B and D are conditionally independent you see that

587
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,710
有条件地独立，您会看到，因此空气是独立的
by this graph given a B and D are conditionally independent you see that

588
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:17,710
有条件地独立，您会看到，因此空气是独立的
conditionally independent you see that so it is being independent given air is

589
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:17,720
有条件地独立，您会看到，因此空气是独立的
so it is being independent given air is being the independent knowing right

590
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,710
是独立的知情权，因为从B到C
so it is being independent given air is being the independent knowing right

because there is about to be from B to C okay

593
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,120
好吧，工作的事情让我们看看这个
because there is about to be from B to C okay

594
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,490
好吧，工作的事情让我们看看这个
okay so business of work let's look at this

595
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:27,500
好吧，工作的事情让我们看看这个
so business of work let's look at this graph we satisfy given baby and you see

596
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:33,399
图表，我们满足了给定的婴儿，您会看到一个独立的状态，所以这是
so business of work let's look at this graph we satisfy given baby and you see

00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:38,230
图表，我们满足了给定的婴儿，您会看到一个独立的状态，所以这是

598
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,240
图表，我们满足了给定的婴儿，您会看到一个独立的状态，所以这是
an independent alright so this is the same relation as there so let's

599
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,789
与那里的关系相同，所以让我们专注于这种独立的关系
an independent alright so this is the same relation as there so let's

601
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:43,460
与那里的关系相同，所以让我们专注于这种独立的关系
concentrate on this independent relation that say but do you think this

602
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,570
这样说，但您是否认为这与B无关，那是为什么
concentrate on this independent relation that say but do you think this

603
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:52,990
这样说，但您是否认为这与B无关，那是为什么
that say but do you think this independent of B why is that

604
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,370
很明显不是吗
that say but do you think this independent of B why is that

605
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:57,380
很明显不是吗


606
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,730
很明显不是吗
that's obvious isn't it

okay so this is the potential defined over over its belief now this comes with

750
00:29:59,790 --> 00:29:59,800
好的，所以这是在其信念范围内定义的潜力，现在有了
over over its belief now this comes with different names right as we receive in

751
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:05,790
当我们在一些书中收到不同的名字时，他们说最大
over over its belief now this comes with different names right as we receive in

752
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,060
当我们在一些书中收到不同的名字时，他们说最大
different names right as we receive in some books they say mister maximum

753
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,070
当我们在一些书中收到不同的名字时，他们说最大
some books they say mister maximum entropy Tydfil for distribution in

熵Tydfil在机器学习中的分布，他们称之为能量
machine learning they call this energy models at the end of the den of the day

757
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,940
在一天的书房尽头的模型，您甚至可以将其视为一头猪
machine learning they call this energy models at the end of the den of the day

758
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,390
在一天的书房尽头的模型，您甚至可以将其视为一头猪
models at the end of the den of the day you can even think of this as a pig

759
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:21,400
在一天的书房尽头的模型，您甚至可以将其视为一头猪
you can even think of this as a pig right well there is no energy or

760
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,390
好吧，没有能量之类的东西，但是你有这些
you can even think of this as a pig right well there is no energy or

761
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,100
好吧，没有能量之类的东西，但是你有这些
right well there is no energy or something like that but you have these

762
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,110
好吧，没有能量之类的东西，但是你有这些
something like that but you have these potentials e to the minus exponential

763
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,530
电位e到负指数，因为这样您可以看到自己
something like that but you have these potentials e to the minus exponential

764
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,570
电位e到负指数，因为这样您可以看到自己
potentials e to the minus exponential because that way you can see that you

765
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:30,580
电位e到负指数，因为这样您可以看到自己
because that way you can see that you will get a positive product that is

766
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,500
将获得相对于具有因子活塞的正积
because that way you can see that you will get a positive product that is

767
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,180
将获得相对于具有因子活塞的正积
will get a positive product that is relative to have the factor piston

768
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,190
将获得相对于具有因子活塞的正积
relative to have the factor piston distribution right so I think it

769
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,940
分配权，所以我认为如果减去能量，它可能会起作用
relative to have the factor piston distribution right so I think it

770
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,420
分配权，所以我认为如果减去能量，它可能会起作用
distribution right so I think it probably does if the minus energy it

771
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:42,430
分配权，所以我认为如果减去能量，它可能会起作用
probably does if the minus energy it doesn't have to be motivated by twisting

772
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,750
不必通过扭曲来激发动力，所以这是一个参数化
probably does if the minus energy it doesn't have to be motivated by twisting

773
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:49,920
不必通过扭曲来激发动力，所以这是一个参数化
doesn't have to be motivated by twisting all right so this is a parametrization

774
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:49,930
不必通过扭曲来激发动力，所以这是一个参数化
all right so this is a parametrization that only accounts for pairwise

775
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:53,790
只占成对的
all right so this is a parametrization that only accounts for pairwise

776
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:53,960
当我们说的时候势能很好，但这不是最大的集团，所以我
all right so this is a parametrization that only accounts for pairwise

777
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:53,970
当我们说的时候势能很好，但这不是最大的集团，所以我


778
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:59,940
当我们说的时候势能很好，但这不是最大的集团，所以我
potentials all right when we say but this is not maximal cliques right so I

779
00:30:59,940 --> 00:30:59,950
当我们说的时候势能很好，但这不是最大的集团，所以我
this is not maximal cliques right so I can see here potential want to 1 3 2 3

780
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:03,540
可以在这里看到潜在的希望1 3 2 3
this is not maximal cliques right so I can see here potential want to 1 3 2 3

781
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:08,130
可以在这里看到潜在的希望1 3 2 3
can see here potential want to 1 3 2 3 so as I said you can actually do

782
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:08,140
可以在这里看到潜在的希望1 3 2 3
so as I said you can actually do anything you want here because this

783
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,740
您在这里想要的任何东西，因为这种分解不是唯一的
so as I said you can actually do anything you want here because this

784
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,010
您在这里想要的任何东西，因为这种分解不是唯一的
anything you want here because this factorization is not unique

785
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:13,020
您在这里想要的任何东西，因为这种分解不是唯一的
factorization is not unique so she reviews pairwise potentials okay

786
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:23,539
所以她可以评估成对的电位，所以她的垃圾箱是一种分析的方式
factorization is not unique so she reviews pairwise potentials okay

787
00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:28,930
所以她可以评估成对的电位，所以她的垃圾箱是一种分析的方式
so she reviews pairwise potentials okay so she the bins are a way of analyzing

788
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:28,940
所以她可以评估成对的电位，所以她的垃圾箱是一种分析的方式
so she the bins are a way of analyzing this potentials from their cliques and

789
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,490
他们的势力带来的潜力，这就是所谓的线性模型
so she the bins are a way of analyzing this potentials from their cliques and

790
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,269
他们的势力带来的潜力，这就是所谓的线性模型
this potentials from their cliques and this is what is called a linear model so

正常人的归一化因子Z可以再次看到，如果
again you see that this animal kills if theta is going to be coming in all the

842
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,780
theta将会一直存在，如果他们
again you see that this animal kills if theta is going to be coming in all the

843
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,910
theta将会一直存在，如果他们
theta is going to be coming in all the time and it's going to be a should they

844
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:35,920
theta将会一直存在，如果他们
time and it's going to be a should they because it's not like okay this is

845
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,210
因为这不好，它与Y成正比，所以我们不需要
time and it's going to be a should they because it's not like okay this is

846
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,160
因为这不好，它与Y成正比，所以我们不需要

00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,170
因为这不好，它与Y成正比，所以我们不需要
proportional to Y we don't need to this so unfortunately if you're going to

848
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,770
所以不幸的是，如果您要估计这些参数的响应
proportional to Y we don't need to this so unfortunately if you're going to

849
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,860
所以不幸的是，如果您要估计这些参数的响应
so unfortunately if you're going to estimate these parameters respond that

850
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:46,870
所以不幸的是，如果您要估计这些参数的响应
estimate these parameters respond that those are powerful through this

851
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,010
通过这个归一化术语，这些功能很强大，例如
estimate these parameters respond that those are powerful through this

852
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,710
通过这个归一化术语，这些功能很强大，例如
those are powerful through this normalization term okay so for example

853
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:52,720
通过这个归一化术语，这些功能很强大，例如
normalization term okay so for example when we try to delete a maximum

854
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,500
当我们尝试删除最大似然估计或地图估计时

00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:58,410
当我们尝试删除最大似然估计或地图估计时
likelihood estimation or map estimation where you can envision if you like this

857
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,240
您可以在此处设想是否可以尝试最大化此权利，以及
likelihood estimation or map estimation where you can envision if you like this

858
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,890
您可以在此处设想是否可以尝试最大化此权利，以及
where you can envision if you like this can try to maximize this right and if

859
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:04,900
您可以在此处设想是否可以尝试最大化此权利，以及
can try to maximize this right and if you do MLA this term is going to be

860
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,340
你做MLA这个术语将很难计算，因为你会
can try to maximize this right and if you do MLA this term is going to be

861
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,649
你做MLA这个术语将很难计算，因为你会
you do MLA this term is going to be difficult to compute because you will

862
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:10,659
你做MLA这个术语将很难计算，因为你会
difficult to compute because you will require integration basically on YC or

863
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:14,460
要求基本上在YC或潜力的乘积上进行集成，以便
difficult to compute because you will require integration basically on YC or

864
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,440
要求基本上在YC或潜力的乘积上进行集成，以便
require integration basically on YC or the product of the potential so that

865
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:16,450
要求基本上在YC或潜力的乘积上进行集成，以便
the product of the potential so that would be very difficult time to operate

866
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:19,940
很好的时间将非常困难，因此这是一个例子
the product of the potential so that would be very difficult time to operate

867
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,180
很好的时间将非常困难，因此这是一个例子
would be very difficult time to operate all right so it was an example if this

868
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,190
很好的时间将非常困难，因此这是一个例子
all right so it was an example if this future functions are if so we paralyze

869
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:30,110
如果未来的功能是这样的话，我们会让我忘了提及的领域瘫痪市场
all right so it was an example if this future functions are if so we paralyze

870
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,270
如果未来的功能是这样的话，我们会让我忘了提及的领域瘫痪市场
future functions are if so we paralyze market on the field I forgot to mention

871
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:33,280
如果未来的功能是这样的话，我们会让我忘了提及的领域瘫痪市场
market on the field I forgot to mention that the field is basically the

872
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,990
基本上，这个领域是替代世界
market on the field I forgot to mention that the field is basically the

873
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,370
基本上，这个领域是替代世界
that the field is basically the alternative world that goes for this

874
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:38,380
基本上，这个领域是替代世界
alternative world that goes for this undirected graphical models so we only

875
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,940
无方向性的图形模型，所以我们只认为它们使潜力瘫痪了，我们
alternative world that goes for this undirected graphical models so we only

876
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,540
无方向性的图形模型，所以我们只认为它们使潜力瘫痪了，我们
undirected graphical models so we only think they paralyze potentials and we

877
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:45,550
无方向性的图形模型，所以我们只认为它们使潜力瘫痪了，我们
think they paralyze potentials and we assume that each of the body which can

878
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,830
假设每个可以取K值的身体，那么这个未来
think they paralyze potentials and we assume that each of the body which can

879
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:51,210
假设每个可以取K值的身体，那么这个未来
assume that each of the body which can take K values and so this future

880
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:51,220
假设每个可以取K值的身体，那么这个未来
take K values and so this future functions are basically indicator

881
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,159
功能基本上是指示器功能，因此在这种情况下，
take K values and so this future functions are basically indicator

882
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,010
功能基本上是指示器功能，因此在这种情况下，
functions are basically indicator function so in this case this particular

883
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,020
功能基本上是指示器功能，因此在这种情况下，
function so in this case this particular indicator function takes the value 1

884
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,260
当变量Y else是day并且变量
function so in this case this particular indicator function takes the value 1

885
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,440
当变量Y else是day并且变量
indicator function takes the value 1 when the variable Y else is day and the

886
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:01,450
当变量Y else是day并且变量
when the variable Y else is day and the value of YT is equal to K ok so and so

887
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:06,030
YT的值等于K ok，所以您可以有效地想到这一点
when the variable Y else is day and the value of YT is equal to K ok so and so

888
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,700
YT的值等于K ok，所以您可以有效地想到这一点
value of YT is equal to K ok so and so effectively you can think of this you

889
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:08,710
YT的值等于K ok，所以您可以有效地想到这一点
effectively you can think of this you know F is a vector of length K squared

890
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,490
知道F是一个长度为K平方的向量，因为您有K乘以K个变量
effectively you can think of this you know F is a vector of length K squared

891
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,880
知道F是一个长度为K平方的向量，因为您有K乘以K个变量
know F is a vector of length K squared because you have K times K variables

892
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:14,890
知道F是一个长度为K平方的向量，因为您有K乘以K个变量
because you have K times K variables okay so the petition basically can be

893
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:19,650
好吧，请愿书基本上可以写成一张桌子，因为如果您尝试
because you have K times K variables okay so the petition basically can be

894
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,019
好吧，请愿书基本上可以写成一张桌子，因为如果您尝试
okay so the petition basically can be written as a table because if you try to

895
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:22,029
好吧，请愿书基本上可以写成一张桌子，因为如果您尝试
written as a table because if you try to calculate the potential for values of y

896
00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:24,089
计算y es和YT等于a和Kelly的值的可能性
written as a table because if you try to calculate the potential for values of y

897
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:26,490
计算y es和YT等于a和Kelly的值的可能性
calculate the potential for values of y es and YT equals a and Kelly so

898
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:26,500
计算y es和YT等于a和Kelly的值的可能性
es and YT equals a and Kelly so effectively what you need to do is you

899
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,589
实际上，您需要做的是，您可以看到这是
es and YT equals a and Kelly so effectively what you need to do is you

900
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:30,630
实际上，您需要做的是，您可以看到这是
effectively what you need to do is you can see that this is the exponential of

901
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:30,640
实际上，您需要做的是，您可以看到这是
can see that this is the exponential of the JK parameter theta s T okay so in

902
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:38,190
JK参数theta可以，因此从某种意义上说
can see that this is the exponential of the JK parameter theta s T okay so in

903
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,380
JK参数theta可以，因此从某种意义上说
the JK parameter theta s T okay so in some sense there is a similarity between

904
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:40,390
JK参数theta可以，因此从某种意义上说
some sense there is a similarity between for this discrete model using tables and

905
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:45,650
对于使用表并使用此功能的离散模型，例如

913
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:30,809
这些通常会在对应的文本中索引
typically of the corresponding parameters all right so this function is

914
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:34,559
参数好，所以这个函数是一个二进制函数，可以取值0

a binary function can take the value 0 over 1 so this way you can identify

917
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:40,069
超过1，这样您就可以识别某些单词，例如
a binary function can take the value 0 over 1 so this way you can identify

918
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:42,920
超过1，这样您就可以识别某些单词，例如
over 1 so this way you can identify certain words so if you have for example

919
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:42,930
超过1，这样您就可以识别某些单词，例如
certain words so if you have for example this is for triplet so if you have a

920
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,170
这是三胞胎，所以如果你有一个我和G的世界，或者你知道什么
certain words so if you have for example this is for triplet so if you have a

921
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:50,249
这是三胞胎，所以如果你有一个我和G的世界，或者你知道什么
this is for triplet so if you have a world I and G or you know or something

922
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:50,259
这是三胞胎，所以如果你有一个我和G的世界，或者你知道什么

similar where the problem is if you try to do this for a real text right and you

925
00:36:56,609 --> 00:36:56,619
类似的问题出在哪里，如果您尝试这样做是为了获得真实的文本，而您
to do this for a real text right and you take you know 26 letters in the alphabet

926
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:00,950
让您知道字母表中有26个字母，因此基本上会得到26:58

so this will result basically to 26:58 parameters theta so will be

929
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:08,009
参数θ，因此在计算上将是一件非常困难的事情
so this will result basically to 26:58 parameters theta so will be

930
00:37:08,009 --> 00:37:10,499
参数θ，因此在计算上将是一件非常困难的事情

931
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:10,509
参数θ，因此在计算上将是一件非常困难的事情
computationally a very difficult thing to do alright so it's not like you're

932
00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:13,289
做得很好，所以这就像您要填充数以百万计的表一样
computationally a very difficult thing to do alright so it's not like you're

933
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:14,970
做得很好，所以这就像您要填充数以百万计的表一样
to do alright so it's not like you're going to populate tables with millions

934
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:14,980
做得很好，所以这就像您要填充数以百万计的表一样
going to populate tables with millions of parameters and you're going to do

935
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,799
参数，您将对计算机执行某种MLE，因此这不会

936
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:21,660
参数，您将对计算机执行某种MLE，因此这不会
of parameters and you're going to do sort of MLE to computer so this will not

937
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:21,670
参数，您将对计算机执行某种MLE，因此这不会
sort of MLE to computer so this will not work very well

938
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,079
工作很好很好，所以现在我回到了
sort of MLE to computer so this will not work very well

939
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,819
工作很好很好，所以现在我回到了
work very well okay so now I went to the back to and

940
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:28,829
工作很好很好，所以现在我回到了
okay so now I went to the back to and slowly to the Ising model and revisited

behaving this way how to behave that way and then in some sense you have a phase

965
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:24,839
然后从某种意义上讲您有一个相变好吧，您可能会认为这是一个
behaving this way how to behave that way and then in some sense you have a phase

original - lab menu I still have the same thing because this Y value must

1098
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:31,229
原始-实验室菜单我仍然有相同的事情，因为此Y值必须
same thing because this Y value must replace minus 1 okay all right so

1099
00:43:31,229 --> 00:43:34,729
替换为负1好吧，所以基本上这就像卖一个
same thing because this Y value must replace minus 1 okay all right so

1100
00:43:34,729 --> 00:43:36,859
替换为负1好吧，所以基本上这就像卖一个
replace minus 1 okay all right so basically this is like selling one of

1101
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:36,869
替换为负1好吧，所以基本上这就像卖一个
basically this is like selling one of the energies on this time somewhere over

1102
00:43:36,869 --> 00:43:39,229
这一次的能量在双绞线上方的某个地方，如果你想写这个
basically this is like selling one of the energies on this time somewhere over

1103
00:43:39,229 --> 00:43:41,269
这一次的能量在双绞线上方的某个地方，如果你想写这个
the energies on this time somewhere over the pair's and if you want to write this

1104
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:41,279
这一次的能量在双绞线上方的某个地方，如果你想写这个
the pair's and if you want to write this in a matrix form

1105
00:43:41,279 --> 00:43:42,319
以矩阵形式好吧，你会穿上一半，所以当
the pair's and if you want to write this in a matrix form

1106
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,189
以矩阵形式好吧，你会穿上一半，所以当
in a matrix form alright you will put on a half so when

1107
00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:46,199
以矩阵形式好吧，你会穿上一半，所以当
alright you will put on a half so when because this is another directed graph

1108
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:48,259
因为这是另一个有向图，您不会考虑
alright you will put on a half so when because this is another directed graph

1109
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:50,900
因为这是另一个有向图，您不会考虑
because this is another directed graph you don't account the interactions that

1110
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:50,910
因为这是另一个有向图，您不会考虑
you don't account the interactions that say from outside and say twice okay so

1111
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:53,829
从外面说两次，好吧，所以也许你可以看到这看起来
you don't account the interactions that say from outside and say twice okay so

1112
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:56,479
从外面说两次，好吧，所以也许你可以看到这看起来
say from outside and say twice okay so so maybe you can see that this looks

1113
00:43:56,479 --> 00:43:56,489
从外面说两次，好吧，所以也许你可以看到这看起来
so maybe you can see that this looks like a Gaussian Marco I mean those in

1114
00:43:56,489 --> 00:43:59,029
像高斯马可（Gaussian Marco），我的意思是图形模型中的人

00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,630
这不是一个容易的问题，也许有些颜色，因为它支持更多的灯光
not an easy problem maybe some colors because this supports more the lights

1342
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:12,640
这不是一个容易的问题，也许有些颜色，因为它支持更多的灯光
because this supports more the lights were there they density of the color

1343
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,550
在那里，它们的颜色密度保持了您所处的状态，所以您不会
because this supports more the lights were there they density of the color

1344
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,170
在那里，它们的颜色密度保持了您所处的状态，所以您不会
were there they density of the color stays what state you are so you don't

1345
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:16,180
在那里，它们的颜色密度保持了您所处的状态，所以您不会
stays what state you are so you don't just black and white but different

1346
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:19,500
只是黑白，但颜色不同我想如果您点击一下
stays what state you are so you don't just black and white but different

1347
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,770
只是黑白，但颜色不同我想如果您点击一下
just black and white but different colors I think if you click this little

1348
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:22,780
只是黑白，但颜色不同我想如果您点击一下
colors I think if you click this little library from Kevin left this to looks

you will see what's the corresponding K for this discussing some sort of

1352
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:44,150
为此，我们讨论了该模型的某种复杂性，因此这里

what I have in here all right this particles okay and they

1358
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:02,460
好的，这个粒子还可以，它们是围绕网格定义的，因此
what I have in here all right this particles okay and they

00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:06,030
好的，这个粒子还可以，它们是围绕网格定义的，因此
are defined about a grid so a mid way to more than just Y variables is an

1361
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:09,600
不仅仅是Y变量是一个不活跃的模块，但是我应该

00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,950
不仅仅是Y变量是一个不活跃的模块，但是我应该
more than just Y variables is an underactive module okay but I should

1363
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:13,960
不仅仅是Y变量是一个不活跃的模块，但是我应该
underactive module okay but I should observe variations of this nodes and a

1364
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,070
观察此节点的变化，并以一种很好的方式描述
underactive module okay but I should observe variations of this nodes and a

00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:18,480
观察此节点的变化，并以一种很好的方式描述
observe variations of this nodes and a very good way to describe the

1366
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:18,490
观察此节点的变化，并以一种很好的方式描述
very good way to describe the subservience is to redirect it model so

1367
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:22,170
subservience是重定向它的模型，所以实际上您拥有的是
very good way to describe the subservience is to redirect it model so

really what you have is you have a mixture and on the Left model to

1370
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:27,090
混合和在Left模型上基本上描述了a上的相关性

Y变量的网格，然后描述观察结果，
describe the observations you have a direct okay

1376
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,980
直接好吧，如果您打算隐藏巨人
describe the observations you have a direct okay

1377
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,560
直接好吧，如果您打算隐藏巨人
direct okay so if you plan to hide the giant

1378
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:38,570
直接好吧，如果您打算隐藏巨人
so if you plan to hide the giant revisionist admission basically and

1379
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:41,560
基本上是修正主义者入场，并且已经看到了这一点，您将要
so if you plan to hide the giant revisionist admission basically and

1380
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,990
基本上是修正主义者入场，并且已经看到了这一点，您将要
revisionist admission basically and already have seen this you're going to

1381
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:44,000
基本上是修正主义者入场，并且已经看到了这一点，您将要
already have seen this you're going to capture these dependencies between the

1382
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,650
通过分解该活塞来捕获变量之间的这些依赖关系
already have seen this you're going to capture these dependencies between the

通过分解该活塞来捕获变量之间的这些依赖关系
variables by factorizing this piston vesicle distribution of Y as a market

1385
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,349
作为市场的Y的囊泡分布，我将对其进行研究

1386
00:54:56,349 --> 00:54:57,280
作为市场的Y的囊泡分布，我将对其进行研究
vesicle distribution of Y as a market I'll go through it

1387
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:57,290
作为市场的Y的囊泡分布，我将对其进行研究
I'll go through it okay this had potential trouble exits

1388
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:00,700
好的，这可能会导致潜在的麻烦，然后我们当然会听到
I'll go through it okay this had potential trouble exits

1389
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,589
好的，这可能会导致潜在的麻烦，然后我们当然会听到
okay this had potential trouble exits and then of course we are going to hear

1390
00:55:02,589 --> 00:55:02,599
好的，这可能会导致潜在的麻烦，然后我们当然会听到
and then of course we are going to hear these observations but I've defined

1391
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,570
这些观察结果，但是我已经通过指令定义了
and then of course we are going to hear these observations but I've defined

1392
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:19,200
这些观察结果，但是我已经通过指令定义了
these observations but I've defined through a directive okay so very much to

1393
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:19,210
这些观察结果，但是我已经通过指令定义了
through a directive okay so very much to emphasize that this is sort of an

1394
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:21,700
强调这是一种有趣的新型图形，因为
through a directive okay so very much to emphasize that this is sort of an

1395
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,500
强调这是一种有趣的新型图形，因为
emphasize that this is sort of an interesting new type of a graph because

1396
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:23,510
强调这是一种有趣的新型图形，因为
interesting new type of a graph because obviously you're not going to capture

1397
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:25,540
显然，您将不会使用有向图来捕获Y中的相关性
interesting new type of a graph because obviously you're not going to capture

1398
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,210
显然，您将不会使用有向图来捕获Y中的相关性
obviously you're not going to capture the correlations in Y with a directed

1399
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:28,220
显然，您将不会使用有向图来捕获Y中的相关性
the correlations in Y with a directed graph because it makes no sense in the

1400
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,740
图，因为它在正确的极限范围内没有意义，因此您将要捕获
the correlations in Y with a directed graph because it makes no sense in the

1401
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,570
图，因为它在正确的极限范围内没有意义，因此您将要捕获
graph because it makes no sense in the limits right so you're going to capture

1402
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:31,580
图，因为它在正确的极限范围内没有意义，因此您将要捕获
limits right so you're going to capture them with an undirected graph but this

1403
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:34,630
他们有一个无向图，但这真的你知道这是有向模型
limits right so you're going to capture them with an undirected graph but this

1404
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:40,510
他们有一个无向图，但这真的你知道这是有向模型
them with an undirected graph but this really you know it is directed model as

1405
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:40,520
他们有一个无向图，但这真的你知道这是有向模型
really you know it is directed model as you see here Y is the parent of white is

1406
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,359
您在这里看到Y是白色的父级，是X的父级，所以这是
really you know it is directed model as you see here Y is the parent of white is

1407
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,240
您在这里看到Y是白色的父级，是X的父级，所以这是
you see here Y is the parent of white is the parent of X so this is the

1408
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:46,250
您在这里看到Y是白色的父级，是X的父级，所以这是
the parent of X so this is the probability of observing XP assuming

1409
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,820
假设图片为真实状态而观察XP的概率
the parent of X so this is the probability of observing XP assuming

1410
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,859
假设图片为真实状态而观察XP的概率
probability of observing XP assuming that the true state of the picture

1411
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:50,869
假设图片为真实状态而观察XP的概率
that the true state of the picture escaped if you actually want to avoid

1412
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:56,710
如果您实际上想避免复杂的事情，请逃脱，您知道您可以做的是
that the true state of the picture escaped if you actually want to avoid

1413
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,510
如果您实际上想避免复杂的事情，请逃脱，您知道您可以做的是
escaped if you actually want to avoid complex this you know what you can do is

1414
00:55:58,510 --> 00:55:58,520
如果您实际上想避免复杂的事情，请逃脱，您知道您可以做的是
complex this you know what you can do is you can take this down here and lamp it

1415
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,020
您可以将其放在此处并点灯，尝试连接电位，然后
complex this you know what you can do is you can take this down here and lamp it

1416
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:06,400
您可以将其放在此处并点灯，尝试连接电位，然后
you can take this down here and lamp it is try this connect potentials and then

1417
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:06,410
您可以将其放在此处并点灯，尝试连接电位，然后
is try this connect potentials and then actually work with an undirected graph

1418
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,870
实际使用无向图，从不打扰并记住我们
is try this connect potentials and then actually work with an undirected graph

1419
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:10,660
实际使用无向图，从不打扰并记住我们
actually work with an undirected graph and never bother with and remember we

1420
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:10,670
实际使用无向图，从不打扰并记住我们
and never bother with and remember we were doing this when we have this

1421
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:11,829
当我们有足够的证据潜力时，我们会把它们混在一起
and never bother with and remember we were doing this when we have this

1422
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:14,260
当我们有足够的证据潜力时，我们会把它们混在一起
were doing this when we have this evidence potentials we will lumping them

1423
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:14,270
当我们有足够的证据潜力时，我们会把它们混在一起
evidence potentials we will lumping them on these terms all right so we can

1424
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:17,650
就这些条款而言，这样我们就可以观看此问题以进行思考，这样您就可以避免
evidence potentials we will lumping them on these terms all right so we can

1425
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:19,900
就这些条款而言，这样我们就可以观看此问题以进行思考，这样您就可以避免
on these terms all right so we can watching this to think and so you avoid

1426
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:19,910
就这些条款而言，这样我们就可以观看此问题以进行思考，这样您就可以避免
watching this to think and so you avoid having to say that you have an

1427
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:22,540
不得不说你有一个无向图，然后你知道
watching this to think and so you avoid having to say that you have an

1428
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:25,990
不得不说你有一个无向图，然后你知道
having to say that you have an undirected graph and then you know a

1429
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:26,000
不得不说你有一个无向图，然后你知道
undirected graph and then you know a direct proportion of

1430
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,770
直接比例
undirected graph and then you know a direct proportion of

1431
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:31,770
好的，所以当您留下混合物时，此图实际上在文献中
undirected graph and then you know a direct proportion of

1432
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:31,780
好的，所以当您留下混合物时，此图实际上在文献中


1433
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:38,370
好的，所以当您留下混合物时，此图实际上在文献中
all right so this graph actually in the literature when you have left a mixture

1434
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:38,380
好的，所以当您留下混合物时，此图实际上在文献中
literature when you have left a mixture of on the left and the left is called

1435
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,840

在较早的一次演讲中提到了这一点
the Chandra I think somewhere I may have mentioned this in passing in in an

1439
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,400
在较早的一次演讲中提到了这一点
mentioned this in passing in in an earlier lecture

1440
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:49,410
在较早的一次演讲中提到了这一点
earlier lecture demand is really the hidden Markov model

1441
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:54,390

1443
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:57,340
需求真的是隐藏的马尔可夫模型还可以，这是您遇到的问题
okay and it's such a problem as you observed markup on the field okay

1444
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,820
在现场观察到的标记好吧，您观察得更快，因为您
okay and it's such a problem as you observed markup on the field okay

1445
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,350
在现场观察到的标记好吧，您观察得更快，因为您
observed markup on the field okay it's faster you observe because you

1446
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:01,360
在现场观察到的标记好吧，您观察得更快，因为您
it's faster you observe because you don't know the rise but you know the

1447
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,640
不知道上升，但您知道附加功能，所以影响是
it's faster you observe because you don't know the rise but you know the

1448
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:09,240
不知道上升，但您知道附加功能，所以影响是
don't know the rise but you know the extras all right so an influence is is a

1449
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:09,250
不知道上升，但您知道附加功能，所以影响是
extras all right so an influence is is a difficult problem so we need to discuss

1450
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,610
困难的问题，所以我们需要讨论如何做到这一点
extras all right so an influence is is a difficult problem so we need to discuss

00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:14,130
困难的问题，所以我们需要讨论如何做到这一点
difficult problem so we need to discuss on how to do this okay

1452
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:14,140
困难的问题，所以我们需要讨论如何做到这一点
on how to do this okay this mention this right and maybe

1453
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:20,880
这个提到这个权利，也许幻灯片中有两个例子
on how to do this okay this mention this right and maybe

1454
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,610
这个提到这个权利，也许幻灯片中有两个例子
this mention this right and maybe there's an example of two in the slides

1455
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:23,620
这个提到这个权利，也许幻灯片中有两个例子
there's an example of two in the slides we take this model and your objective is

1456
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:28,500
我们采用这种模型，您的目标是使用积分常数，因此
there's an example of two in the slides we take this model and your objective is

1457
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,600
我们采用这种模型，您的目标是使用积分常数，因此
we take this model and your objective is the use of the integration constant so

1458
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:30,610
我们采用这种模型，您的目标是使用积分常数，因此
the use of the integration constant so you know you give an X and you try to

1459
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:31,980
您知道您给了X，然后尝试计算Y，所以它位于第一层
the use of the integration constant so you know you give an X and you try to

1460

您知道您给了X，然后尝试计算Y，所以它位于第一层
you know you give an X and you try to compute Y so this first layer it's in

1461
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:36,100
您知道您给了X，然后尝试计算Y，所以它位于第一层
compute Y so this first layer it's in that soil is basically this all right

1462
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:40,010
基本上是土壤这是一个标记随机字段
compute Y so this first layer it's in that soil is basically this all right

1476
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:10,240
从黑色到70左右的某个位置，所以在一个无人监督的问题中，此文件
so in an unsupervised problem this file will not work

1477
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,370
不能正常工作，所以可以在这里使用它，或者
so in an unsupervised problem this file will not work

我们去找你应该给你一个家庭作业的角落


1525
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:09,620
我们去找你应该给你一个家庭作业的角落
we went to some kind of you should to give you a homework corner on the

1526
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:09,630
我们去找你应该给你一个家庭作业的角落
give you a homework corner on the Gaussian random field it seems I know

1527
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:14,390
高斯随机场似乎我肯定是正确的，但是正在发生的是
give you a homework corner on the Gaussian random field it seems I know

1528
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:20,440
高斯随机场似乎我肯定是正确的，但是正在发生的是
Gaussian random field it seems I know for sure right but what's happening is

1529
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:20,450
高斯随机场似乎我肯定是正确的，但是正在发生的是
for sure right but what's happening is metrics not the precision metrics and

1530
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,270
指标而不是精度指标，尤其是跨指标不一样
for sure right but what's happening is metrics not the precision metrics and

1531
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:25,940
指标而不是精度指标，尤其是跨指标不一样
metrics not the precision metrics and especially trans metrics is not the same

1532
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:25,950
指标而不是精度指标，尤其是跨指标不一样
especially trans metrics is not the same as the space precision metrics okay

1533
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:29,710
因为空间精度指标还可以，所以这个测量值
especially trans metrics is not the same as the space precision metrics okay

1534
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:34,190
因为空间精度指标还可以，所以这个测量值
as the space precision metrics okay right so this this measurement around

1535
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:34,200
因为空间精度指标还可以，所以这个测量值
right so this this measurement around the fields need to Espace precision

1536
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,830
这些字段需要Espace精度指标，好吧，我们每个工作的数字
right so this this measurement around the fields need to Espace precision

1537
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:40,220
这些字段需要Espace精度指标，好吧，我们每个工作的数字
the fields need to Espace precision metrics okay the numbers we worked every

1538
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:40,230
这些字段需要Espace精度指标，好吧，我们每个工作的数字
metrics okay the numbers we worked every into the course they were leading to

1539
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:42,050
在课程中，它们又导致了稀疏协方差矩阵
metrics okay the numbers we worked every into the course they were leading to

1540
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:48,920
在课程中，它们又导致了稀疏协方差矩阵
into the course they were leading to sparse covariance matrix again you may

1541
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:48,930
在课程中，它们又导致了稀疏协方差矩阵
sparse covariance matrix again you may want to look on on on the notes so

1542
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:53,390
想看笔记，所以很明显你根本不知道
sparse covariance matrix again you may want to look on on on the notes so

1543
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:57,170
想看笔记，所以很明显你根本不知道
want to look on on on the notes so obviously you don't even know the

1544
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:57,180
想看笔记，所以很明显你根本不知道
obviously you don't even know the specialty of this lambda so here we use

1545
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,950
这个lambda的特色，所以在这里我们使用成对铅笔
obviously you don't even know the specialty of this lambda so here we use

1546
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:01,910
这个lambda的特色，所以在这里我们使用成对铅笔
specialty of this lambda so here we use pairwise for pencils

1547
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:01,920
这个lambda的特色，所以在这里我们使用成对铅笔
pairwise for pencils so in essence in essence here if this

1548
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:07,970
所以从本质上讲，如果此术语是数据，则在这里实现，如果
pairwise for pencils so in essence in essence here if this

1549
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:10,550
所以从本质上讲，如果此术语是数据，则在这里实现，如果
so in essence in essence here if this term is data or not it implements if

1550
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:10,560
所以从本质上讲，如果此术语是数据，则在这里实现，如果
term is data or not it implements if there is link between two notes or not

1551
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,410
在两个音符之间是否存在联系，因此本质上是学习
term is data or not it implements if there is link between two notes or not

1552
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,990
在两个音符之间是否存在联系，因此本质上是学习
there is link between two notes or not so in essence learning the values of

1553
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:15,000
在两个音符之间是否存在联系，因此本质上是学习
so in essence learning the values of lambda is the same problem as learning a

1554
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,180
lambda与学习图形模型的结构是相同的问题，所以
so in essence learning the values of lambda is the same problem as learning a

1555
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:21,380
lambda与学习图形模型的结构是相同的问题，所以
lambda is the same problem as learning a structure of the graphical model okay so

1556
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:21,390
lambda与学习图形模型的结构是相同的问题，所以
structure of the graphical model okay so you can pass this as an optimization

1557
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:23,660
您可以将其作为优化问题通过，因为您可以学习
structure of the graphical model okay so you can pass this as an optimization

1558
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,880
您可以将其作为优化问题通过，因为您可以学习
you can pass this as an optimization problem for you learn the structure of

1559
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:25,890
您可以将其作为优化问题通过，因为您可以学习
problem for you learn the structure of the problem on the clock right

1560
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:29,690
时钟正确的问题
problem for you learn the structure of the problem on the clock right

1561
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:34,370
所以我要给你一个扩展，我们对此进行了讨论，你知道你知道
problem for you learn the structure of the problem on the clock right

1562
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:34,380
所以我要给你一个扩展，我们对此进行了讨论，你知道你知道


1563
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:43,190
所以我要给你一个扩展，我们对此进行了讨论，你知道你知道
so I'm going to give you an extension we discussed on this you know you know

1564
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:43,200
所以我要给你一个扩展，我们对此进行了讨论，你知道你知道
discussed on this you know you know Pat's model where the microphone that

1565
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,410
帕特（Pat）的模型
discussed on this you know you know Pat's model where the microphone that

1566
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:50,660
帕特（Pat）的模型
Pat's model where the microphone that feels for y all right and and and then

1567
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:50,670
帕特（Pat）的模型
feels for y all right and and and then we had an observation longer but can do

1568
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:53,120
我们有更长的观察时间，但基本上可以做任何事情，可以是高斯或
feels for y all right and and and then we had an observation longer but can do

1569
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,060
我们有更长的观察时间，但基本上可以做任何事情，可以是高斯或
we had an observation longer but can do anything basically can be a Gaussian or

1570
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:55,070
我们有更长的观察时间，但基本上可以做任何事情，可以是高斯或
anything basically can be a Gaussian or something like that so I mean I'm going

1571
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:57,440
这样的事情，所以我的意思是我要给你一张照片，我要你
anything basically can be a Gaussian or something like that so I mean I'm going

01:01:59,300 --> 01:01:59,310
这样的事情，所以我的意思是我要给你一张照片，我要你
to give you a picture and I want you to look at this picture and they'll be so

1574
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:03,020
看看这张照片，他们会的，这样就没事了
to give you a picture and I want you to look at this picture and they'll be so

01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:16,320
当涉及到此链接的上下文时，您会看到什么
the context of the links on this on the same as the change in time

1583
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:24,050
与时间的变化相同，所以让我们在给定的时间说
the context of the links on this on the same as the change in time

1584
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:28,480
与时间的变化相同，所以让我们在给定的时间说
same as the change in time okay so look let's say at a given time

1585
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:28,490
与时间的变化相同，所以让我们在给定的时间说
okay so look let's say at a given time is the past

1586
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:35,270
是过去
okay so look let's say at a given time is the past

1587
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:40,930
所以我们在这里看，这取决于谁-视图也取决于2-3对
okay so look let's say at a given time is the past

1588
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:40,940

1589
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:52,450
所以我们在这里看，这取决于谁-视图也取决于2-3对
so we are looking here it depends on who - view but also depends on 2-3 right

1590
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:55,960
看起来像这样，特别是给定的YT减去1 YT，YT的磁导率

想一想，一旦您知道怎么做艾米莉（Emily），基本上就不会对地图进行估算
basically a map estimation is nothing but to put the power out there and do

1666
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,849
但要把功率放在那里并进行同样的计算，好吧，所以n
basically a map estimation is nothing but to put the power out there and do

1667
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:23,059
但要把功率放在那里并进行同样的计算，好吧，所以n

the same sort of calculation okay so n data points so this not my observations

1669
01:06:23,069 --> 01:06:25,999
数据点，所以这不是我的观察结果，我将这个功能强大
the same sort of calculation okay so n data points so this not my observations

weii okay and i'm i put this powerful man over in there because it's going to

1672
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:35,479
在那里的人，因为它将简化我想做的计算
weii okay and i'm i put this powerful man over in there because it's going to

1704
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:37,060
您必须计算的无限问题，我们必须基本上链接所有内容
have to link basically everything together okay so this is not good

1705
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:39,599
一起好吧，所以这不好，所以我们需要找到一些方法
have to link basically everything together okay so this is not good

1706
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,109
一起好吧，所以这不好，所以我们需要找到一些方法
together okay so this is not good all right so we need to find some way to

1707
01:07:43,109 --> 01:07:43,119
一起好吧，所以这不好，所以我们需要找到一些方法
all right so we need to find some way to handle this problem okay so let's see

1708
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,359
好好处理这个问题，让我们看看会导致什么
all right so we need to find some way to handle this problem okay so let's see

1709
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:49,740
好好处理这个问题，让我们看看会导致什么
handle this problem okay so let's see what is going to lead into this

1710
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:49,750
好好处理这个问题，让我们看看会导致什么
what is going to lead into this distribution form it looks like an

1711
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:52,320
分布形式，它看起来像是指数函数类型
what is going to lead into this distribution form it looks like an

1712
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,640
分布形式，它看起来像是指数函数类型
distribution form it looks like an exponential function type of

1713
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:53,650
分布形式，它看起来像是指数函数类型
exponential function type of distribution so if we haven't proved it

1714
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:57,060
分配，所以如果我们在本学期没有证明这一点，则在
exponential function type of distribution so if we haven't proved it

1715
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:01,530
分配，所以如果我们在本学期没有证明这一点，则在
distribution so if we haven't proved it on this semester it's in the notes from

1716
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:01,540
分配，所以如果我们在本学期没有证明这一点，则在
on this semester it's in the notes from the Christmas semester so you can look

1717
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,660
圣诞节学期，所以你基本上可以看一下
on this semester it's in the notes from the Christmas semester so you can look

1718
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:05,790
圣诞节学期，所以你基本上可以看一下
the Christmas semester so you can look at it basically the likelihood is a

1719
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:05,800
圣诞节学期，所以你基本上可以看一下
at it basically the likelihood is a convex function of the parameters so it

1720
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,010
参数的凸函数，因此它具有唯一的最大值，所以这是个好消息
at it basically the likelihood is a convex function of the parameters so it

1721
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:11,490
参数的凸函数，因此它具有唯一的最大值，所以这是个好消息
convex function of the parameters so it has a unique maximum so that's good news

1722
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:11,500
参数的凸函数，因此它具有唯一的最大值，所以这是个好消息
has a unique maximum so that's good news so this is a solution if we want to do

1723
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:14,010
所以这是一个解决方案，如果我们要进行MLA，我的意思是这值得关注
has a unique maximum so that's good news so this is a solution if we want to do

1724
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:17,280
所以这是一个解决方案，如果我们要进行MLA，我的意思是这值得关注
so this is a solution if we want to do an MLA I mean this is of concern

1725
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:17,290
所以这是一个解决方案，如果我们要进行MLA，我的意思是这值得关注
an MLA I mean this is of concern obviously because if you have some

1726
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:19,440
显然是因为如果您有一些分区功能，会发生什么
an MLA I mean this is of concern obviously because if you have some

1727
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,930
显然是因为如果您有一些分区功能，会发生什么
obviously because if you have some partition functions yes what happens

1728
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:21,940
显然是因为如果您有一些分区功能，会发生什么
partition functions yes what happens right there's no I don't think that it

1729
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,970
对，没有，我不认为它会给你一个凸函数，但是
partition functions yes what happens right there's no I don't think that it

1730
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:26,809
对，没有，我不认为它会给你一个凸函数，但是
right there's no I don't think that it will give you a convex function but

1731
01:08:26,809 --> 01:08:26,819
对，没有，我不认为它会给你一个凸函数，但是
will give you a convex function but because of this exponential poly

1732
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:29,039
由于这种指数多边形分布，您得到了一个凸函数
will give you a convex function but because of this exponential poly
