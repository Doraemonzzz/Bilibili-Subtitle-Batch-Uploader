420
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,050
因为我们的第一个点的权重然后到达我们的实例的味道
and then come to our instance tastes simple which is part so we can only like

421
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,670
很简单，这是一部分，因此我们只能喜欢此栏右框中的值，
and then come to our instance tastes simple which is part so we can only like

422
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,230
很简单，这是一部分，因此我们只能喜欢此栏右框中的值，

423
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:35,240
很简单，这是一部分，因此我们只能喜欢此栏右框中的值，
our values from this bar right box and and there is no constraint on heart

424
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,860
对心脏没有任何约束，这意味着我们可以发送

which means that we can send off whatever we want

427
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,620
我们想要的就是让我们假设简单的艺术是
which means that we can send off whatever we want

428
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,130
我们想要的就是让我们假设简单的艺术是
whatever we want let's assume that with simple art is

429
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,140
我们想要的就是让我们假设简单的艺术是
let's assume that with simple art is true are true and then we move to

430
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,320
true是true，然后我们以表格为例，说我们的眼睛
let's assume that with simple art is true are true and then we move to

431
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,840
true是true，然后我们以表格为例，说我们的眼睛
true are true and then we move to example the table and says the our eyes

432
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:53,850
true是true，然后我们以表格为例，说我们的眼睛
example the table and says the our eyes way is for that to be true

433
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,300
方式是使我们真实，我们的样本是真实的，然后回来
example the table and says the our eyes way is for that to be true

434
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,470
方式是使我们真实，我们的样本是真实的，然后回来
way is for that to be true our is sample to be true and come back

435
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
方式是使我们真实，我们的样本是真实的，然后回来
our is sample to be true and come back to the evidence we record W to be true

436
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,550
证明我们将W记录为真，因此表只能是W
our is sample to be true and come back to the evidence we record W to be true

437
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,660
证明我们将W记录为真，因此表只能是W
to the evidence we record W to be true so because the table can be only only it

438
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:08,670
证明我们将W记录为真，因此表只能是W
so because the table can be only only it can be only in 9.99

439
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,120
只能在9.99，而我们最终发现了另一种方式
so because the table can be only only it can be only in 9.99

440
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,880
只能在9.99，而我们最终发现了另一种方式
can be only in 9.99 and we caught another way finally our

441
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:13,890
只能在9.99，而我们最终发现了另一种方式
and we caught another way finally our total weight is 0.1 multiplied 199 which

442
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,750
总重量是0.1乘以199，即今晚的0.09，我们只是

is 0.09 tonight and we just just multiplied and just multiply our sample

445
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,820
乘以我们的样本，然后乘以这就是我们的样本乘以该权重
is 0.09 tonight and we just just multiplied and just multiply our sample

you want to know what this is you first have to label yet you have a big picture

1045
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:26,250
必须贴上标签，但您有一幅大图，然后我们必须说出对象在哪里
you want to know what this is you first have to label yet you have a big picture

00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:30,420
必须贴上标签，但您有一幅大图，然后我们必须说出对象在哪里
then we have to say where is the object this is a primary step

1048
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,590
这是我们在可以渲染的Google上进行搜索时的第一步
then we have to say where is the object this is a primary step
