this Gaussian plus some all right so this is what's called the

305
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,749
好的，这就是所谓的拍手问题，所以如果你能想到的话
this Gaussian plus some all right so this is what's called the

306
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:43,029
好的，这就是所谓的拍手问题，所以如果你能想到的话
all right so this is what's called the clattering problem so if you can think

307
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:43,039
好的，这就是所谓的拍手问题，所以如果你能想到的话
clattering problem so if you can think of you having this Gaussian you really

308
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:45,279
你们中有这个高斯的人，您真的想升级这场雨，但是

309
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,199
你们中有这个高斯的人，您真的想升级这场雨，但是
of you having this Gaussian you really want to escalate this rain but the

310
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:47,209
你们中有这个高斯的人，您真的想升级这场雨，但是

我们将要去噪音的是他去估计参数theta
what we're going to just noise he went to the estimation of the parameter theta

316
00:12:58,109 --> 00:12:58,119
我们将要去噪音的是他去估计参数theta
to the estimation of the parameter theta so in this problem ranges to compute the

317
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:01,119

318
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:03,339
所以在这个问题范围内计算一阶基本上是
so in this problem ranges to compute the first order is basically the

319
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:03,349
所以在这个问题范围内计算一阶基本上是
first order is basically the unnormalized posterior as the prior

320
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,499
未归一化的后验作为活动的可能性和H的先前时间
first order is basically the unnormalized posterior as the prior

未归一化的后验作为活动的可能性和H的先前时间
unnormalized posterior as the prior times the likelihood and H of an active

322
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
未归一化的后验作为活动的可能性和H的先前时间
times the likelihood and H of an active in terms is a Gaussian mixture so if you

323
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,199
用高斯混合表示，所以如果您有n个数据点，并且将其扩展
times the likelihood and H of an active in terms is a Gaussian mixture so if you

324
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:14,139
用高斯混合表示，所以如果您有n个数据点，并且将其扩展
in terms is a Gaussian mixture so if you have n data points and you expand this

325
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:14,149
用高斯混合表示，所以如果您有n个数据点，并且将其扩展
have n data points and you expand this product there you're going to get 2 to

326
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:16,239
那里的乘积将得到2的N，所以状态可以非常
have n data points and you expand this product there you're going to get 2 to

327
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:20,829
那里的乘积将得到2的N，所以状态可以非常

图片来了，但让我们考虑一个确切的分布，第一个是
exact distribution the first one is a mixture of two thousands

740
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,990
两千个混合的，就是f 1，我们说
exact distribution the first one is a mixture of two thousands

741
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,260
两千个混合的，就是f 1，我们说
mixture of two thousands okay that's f 1 and let's say we're

742
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:12,270
两千个混合的，就是f 1，我们说
okay that's f 1 and let's say we're going to approximate this factor with

743
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,970
将与这个失踪的人近似这个因素，因为
okay that's f 1 and let's say we're going to approximate this factor with

744
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,610
将与这个失踪的人近似这个因素，因为
going to approximate this factor with this missing person because just to be

745
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:16,620
将与这个失踪的人近似这个因素，因为
this missing person because just to be in the exponential family now she'll so

746
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,200
现在在指数家庭中，她将使两个的第二个因子看起来像
this missing person because just to be in the exponential family now she'll so

747
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,330
现在在指数家庭中，她将使两个的第二个因子看起来像
in the exponential family now she'll so the second factor of two looks like a

748
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:23,340
现在在指数家庭中，她将使两个的第二个因子看起来像
the second factor of two looks like a Gaussian so we get an extra

749
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,770
高斯，所以我们得到一个额外的近似值，所以如果你采取
the second factor of two looks like a Gaussian so we get an extra

750
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,110
高斯，所以我们得到一个额外的近似值，所以如果你采取
Gaussian so we get an extra approximation all right so if you take

751
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,120
高斯，所以我们得到一个额外的近似值，所以如果你采取
approximation all right so if you take so this is the just product of F 1 and F

752
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,570
所以这是F 1和F 2的乘积，这正是我们想要的
approximation all right so if you take so this is the just product of F 1 and F

753
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,700
所以这是F 1和F 2的乘积，这正是我们想要的
so this is the just product of F 1 and F 2 this is really what we want

754
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:31,710
所以这是F 1和F 2的乘积，这正是我们想要的
2 this is really what we want approximate well and now this is the

755
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,039
近似好，现在这是两个近似值的乘积
2 this is really what we want approximate well and now this is the

756
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:35,990
近似好，现在这是两个近似值的乘积
approximate well and now this is the product of the two approximation and

757
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,000
近似好，现在这是两个近似值的乘积
product of the two approximation and your faith is not a very good

758
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,710
您的信心不是一个很好的计算方法，因为主要是我们将其固定
product of the two approximation and your faith is not a very good

759
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:41,480
您的信心不是一个很好的计算方法，因为主要是我们将其固定
your faith is not a very good calculation because mainly we screw it

760
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:41,490
您的信心不是一个很好的计算方法，因为主要是我们将其固定
calculation because mainly we screw it up there okay all right we don't know

761
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:49,159
在那里，好吧，我们不知道你怎么会告诉我你得到了这个
calculation because mainly we screw it up there okay all right we don't know

762
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:51,230
在那里，好吧，我们不知道你怎么会告诉我你得到了这个
up there okay all right we don't know how you're gonna tell me you get this

763
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:51,240
在那里，好吧，我们不知道你怎么会告诉我你得到了这个
how you're gonna tell me you get this model approximation of needs to be very

764
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,909
需求的模型近似值非常好，所以当您
how you're gonna tell me you get this model approximation of needs to be very

765
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:56,299
需求的模型近似值非常好，所以当您
model approximation of needs to be very good so the addition is when you

766
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:56,309
需求的模型近似值非常好，所以当您
good so the addition is when you approximate that one right

767
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:59,000
近似他所放的一项权利，也很有可能
good so the addition is when you approximate that one right

768
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,549
近似他所放的一项权利，也很有可能
approximate that one right he put and also a lot of probability

769
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:01,559
近似他所放的一项权利，也很有可能
he put and also a lot of probability mass in the approximation to match that

770
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,799
近似匹配的质量，但您确实忘记了
he put and also a lot of probability mass in the approximation to match that

771
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:07,100
近似匹配的质量，但您确实忘记了
mass in the approximation to match that one but you really have forgot that the

772
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,110
近似匹配的质量，但您确实忘记了
one but you really have forgot that the probability mass effective here is zero

773
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,750
此处质量有效的概率为零，因此就像您要投入很多钱一样
one but you really have forgot that the probability mass effective here is zero

774
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,460
此处质量有效的概率为零，因此就像您要投入很多钱一样
probability mass effective here is zero so like you're investing a lot of money

775
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:13,470
此处质量有效的概率为零，因此就像您要投入很多钱一样
so like you're investing a lot of money to approximate well at one in a region

776
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,580
在一个不存在的区域中近似于一个
so like you're investing a lot of money to approximate well at one in a region

777
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,010
在一个不存在的区域中近似于一个
to approximate well at one in a region that doesn't

778
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,960
您必须要做的是，我们不采取任何措施使这些因素
to approximate well at one in a region that doesn't

779
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:21,970
您必须要做的是，我们不采取任何措施使这些因素


780
00:28:21,970 --> 00:29:10,870
您必须要做的是，我们不采取任何措施使这些因素
you have to do in the we don't approach to make these factors in the penny of

781
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:10,880
您必须要做的是，我们不采取任何措施使这些因素
to make these factors in the penny of each other but so we try to to do

782
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,100
彼此，但是我们尝试做得比那更好，所以我只是
to make these factors in the penny of each other but so we try to to do

783
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:20,169
彼此，但是我们尝试做得比那更好，所以我只是
each other but so we try to to do something better than that so I just

784
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:20,179
彼此，但是我们尝试做得比那更好，所以我只是
something better than that so I just have an idea verse for this algorithm

785
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:22,750
对于这种算法有一个想法的诗句，它也不是很复杂，但是
something better than that so I just have an idea verse for this algorithm

786
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,930
对于这种算法有一个想法的诗句，它也不是很复杂，但是
have an idea verse for this algorithm and again it is not very complicated but

787
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:25,940
对于这种算法有一个想法的诗句，它也不是很复杂，但是
and again it is not very complicated but you need to pay attention the algebra

788
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,540
您需要注意您知道的代数可能会有些混乱
and again it is not very complicated but you need to pay attention the algebra

789
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,770
您需要注意您知道的代数可能会有些混乱
you need to pay attention the algebra you know may be a little bit confusing

790
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:32,780
您需要注意您知道的代数可能会有些混乱
you know may be a little bit confusing it is really not okay so I'm going to

791
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,220
真的不行，所以我只做Z，我提醒你
you know may be a little bit confusing it is really not okay so I'm going to

792
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,610
真的不行，所以我只做Z，我提醒你
it is really not okay so I'm going to make only the Z and I remind you this

793
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:39,620
真的不行，所以我只做Z，我提醒你
make only the Z and I remind you this kind of thing because the approximation

794
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,970
之类的东西，因为如果您选择近似值，则近似值分布
make only the Z and I remind you this kind of thing because the approximation

795
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,740
之类的东西，因为如果您选择近似值，则近似值分布
kind of thing because the approximation the approximate distribution if you pick

796
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:44,750
之类的东西，因为如果您选择近似值，则近似值分布
the approximate distribution if you pick up so this is part of J so we because we

797
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:49,330
向上，所以这是J的一部分，所以我们因为我们现在不会像在
the approximate distribution if you pick up so this is part of J so we because we

798
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:54,510
向上，所以这是J的一部分，所以我们因为我们现在不会像在
up so this is part of J so we because we won't approximate now right like in the

799
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:54,520
向上，所以这是J的一部分，所以我们因为我们现在不会像在
won't approximate now right like in the approximation so okay to be close to

800
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:10,270
近似值，可以接近这个FJ，我们将尝试使
won't approximate now right like in the approximation so okay to be close to

801
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,850
近似值，可以接近这个FJ，我们将尝试使
approximation so okay to be close to this F J we're going to try to make

802
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:13,860
近似值，可以接近这个FJ，我们将尝试使
this F J we're going to try to make distribution as close as possible to the

803
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,720
该漫画作品集验证了与pj x尽可能接近的分布
this F J we're going to try to make distribution as close as possible to the

00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:23,210
该漫画作品集验证了与pj x尽可能接近的分布
distribution as close as possible to the pj x this manga folio verifies for the

805
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:23,220
该漫画作品集验证了与pj x尽可能接近的分布
pj x this manga folio verifies for the surprise of the approximate apart so

806
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:31,970
当我们计算出126到
pj x this manga folio verifies for the surprise of the approximate apart so

807
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:37,640
当我们计算出126到
surprise of the approximate apart so again when we compute that 126 to coming

808
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:37,650
当我们计算出126到
again when we compute that 126 to coming it's coming here so we're going to be

809
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,660
它来了，所以我们要近似一些
again when we compute that 126 to coming it's coming here so we're going to be

810
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,620
它来了，所以我们要近似一些
it's coming here so we're going to be approximating alright

811
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:42,630
它来了，所以我们要近似一些
approximating alright this whole distribution to be as close

812
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,750
整个分布要尽可能的好
approximating alright this whole distribution to be as close

813
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,330
整个分布要尽可能的好
this whole distribution to be as close as possible to that all right well this

814
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:47,340
整个分布要尽可能的好
as possible to that all right well this is the exact factor all right but this

815
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,330
是完全正确的因子，但这是我们使用的近似值
as possible to that all right well this is the exact factor all right but this

816
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,210
是完全正确的因子，但这是我们使用的近似值
is the exact factor all right but this is we use the approximation of for the

817
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:53,220
是完全正确的因子，但这是我们使用的近似值
is we use the approximation of for the other factors that we have gained up to

818
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,799
到现在为止，我们已经获得了其他因素，我们将继续这样做
is we use the approximation of for the other factors that we have gained up to

到现在为止，我们已经获得了其他因素，我们将继续这样做
other factors that we have gained up to now again we're gonna do this

820
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:56,940
到现在为止，我们已经获得了其他因素，我们将继续这样做
now again we're gonna do this iteratively right so whatever particles

821
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,870
迭代是正确的，所以无论我们对内部其他粒子有什么粒子
now again we're gonna do this iteratively right so whatever particles

moments of cure Flippa have to march through the moments to go okay all right

918
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:53,260
经过一会儿好吧好吧，所以我们首先说它是高斯
moments of cure Flippa have to march through the moments to go okay all right

919
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,339
经过一会儿好吧好吧，所以我们首先说它是高斯
through the moments to go okay all right so let's say it first is Gaussian is

920
00:34:57,339 --> 00:34:57,349
经过一会儿好吧好吧，所以我们首先说它是高斯
so let's say it first is Gaussian is like I'm going to live with the mean

921
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:59,890
就像我要习惯于实践中使用的平均语言一样
so let's say it first is Gaussian is like I'm going to live with the mean

922
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,500
就像我要习惯于实践中使用的平均语言一样
like I'm going to live with the mean ology used in practice right like taking

923
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:02,510
就像我要习惯于实践中使用的平均语言一样
ology used in practice right like taking the distribution on the left hand side

926
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,030
在左侧的分布并将其投影到高斯说一些
and projecting it to Gaussian say some  to be the ocean and we're studying

927
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:14,859
变成海洋，我们正在向附属的高斯研究那些时刻

those moments to an affiliated Gaussian okay an operation this can you achieve

931
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:22,510
好吧，这可以实现文献中写的操作吗？
okay an operation this can you achieve written in the literature there's a

932
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:22,520
好吧，这可以实现文献中写的操作吗？
written in the literature there's a projection operator so think of this you

933
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,940
投影运算符，因此，请考虑一下您所拥有的分布
written in the literature there's a projection operator so think of this you

projection operator so think of this you know whatever distribution you have

935
00:35:26,589 --> 00:35:26,599
投影运算符，因此，请考虑一下您所拥有的分布
know whatever distribution you have you're going to approach range with a

936
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:28,630
您将通过这一步与高斯人接近范围
know whatever distribution you have you're going to approach range with a

937
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,370
您将通过这一步与高斯人接近范围
you're going to approach range with a Gaussian through this one with marching

938
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:30,380
您将通过这一步与高斯人接近范围
Gaussian through this one with marching and so you've trapped the moment and

939
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,620
因此，您已经捕捉到了这一刻，然后将它们分配给高斯，因此
Gaussian through this one with marching and so you've trapped the moment and

940
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,539
因此，您已经捕捉到了这一刻，然后将它们分配给高斯，因此
and so you've trapped the moment and then you assign them to a Gaussian so

941
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:34,549
因此，您已经捕捉到了这一刻，然后将它们分配给高斯，因此
then you assign them to a Gaussian so that's the projections that we computed

942
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:40,450
那就是我们计算theta的新分布Q的投影，然后我们
then you assign them to a Gaussian so that's the projections that we computed

943
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:44,079
那就是我们计算theta的新分布Q的投影，然后我们
that's the projections that we computed new distribution Q of theta and then we

944
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:44,089
那就是我们计算theta的新分布Q的投影，然后我们
new distribution Q of theta and then we want to update the software at J and I

945
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:46,720
想要更新J处的软件，并提醒您，C的任务P是
new distribution Q of theta and then we want to update the software at J and I

946
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,849
想要更新J处的软件，并提醒您，C的任务P是
want to update the software at J and I remind you that this mission P of C is

947
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:48,859
想要更新J处的软件，并提醒您，C的任务P是
remind you that this mission P of C is written as left J times this

948
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:53,500
写成左J倍
remind you that this mission P of C is written as left J times this

949
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,120
近似因子，所以theta的XA基本上是
remind you that this mission P of C is written as left J times this

950
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,130
近似因子，所以theta的XA基本上是


951
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:58,809
近似因子，所以theta的XA基本上是
approximation factors so basically XA of theta would be some

952
00:35:58,809 --> 00:35:58,819
近似因子，所以theta的XA基本上是
so basically XA of theta would be some normalization factor that you need times

953
00:35:58,819 --> 00:36:01,240
您需要的归一化因子乘以您的归一化分布Q

想法是当行进的那一刻好吗，你们两个人被Q除
what you see on the bottom alright so the idea is when the moment marching

985
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:25,070
想法是当行进的那一刻好吗，你们两个人被Q除
the idea is when the moment marching okay computer home you two divided by Q

986
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:25,080
想法是当行进的那一刻好吗，你们两个人被Q除
okay computer home you two divided by Q minus a multiplied with the

987
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,470
减去乘以归一化因子的值必须是
okay computer home you two divided by Q minus a multiplied with the

988
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,240
减去乘以归一化因子的值必须是
minus a multiplied with the normalization factor must be a plate of

00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:29,250
减去乘以归一化因子的值必须是
normalization factor must be a plate of us today what's it

990
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,840
我们今天是什么
normalization factor must be a plate of us today what's it

991
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,220
好的，所以我将再次强调计算关键点的关键
normalization factor must be a plate of us today what's it

992
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,230
好的，所以我将再次强调计算关键点的关键


993
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:42,770
好的，所以我将再次强调计算关键点的关键
okay so I am going to emphasize again the key to key points right we compute

994
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:42,780
好的，所以我将再次强调计算关键点的关键
the key to key points right we compute its factor

995
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,180
它的因素还好，并不独立于其他因素
the key to key points right we compute its factor

996
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,420
它的因素还好，并不独立于其他因素
its factor all right not independent of the other

997
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:47,430
它的因素还好，并不独立于其他因素
all right not independent of the other factors but in a way that the the

998
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:52,370
因素，但以某种方式让您的女演员占
all right not independent of the other factors but in a way that the the

999
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,230
因素，但以某种方式让您的女演员占
factors but in a way that the the probability of your actresses accounted

1000
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:54,240
因素，但以某种方式让您的女演员占
probability of your actresses accounted in the approximation and we do this by

1001
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,510
在近似中，我们通过不将此FJ学院的FJ与
probability of your actresses accounted in the approximation and we do this by

1002
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:00,740
在近似中，我们通过不将此FJ学院的FJ与
in the approximation and we do this by not matching FJ this FJ Academy with the

1003
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:00,750
在近似中，我们通过不将此FJ学院的FJ与
not matching FJ this FJ Academy with the exact FJ but my matching Q theta with

1004
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:04,700
确切的FJ，但我的匹配Q theta可以，所以我们没有做
not matching FJ this FJ Academy with the exact FJ but my matching Q theta with

1005
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,380
确切的FJ，但我的匹配Q theta可以，所以我们没有做
exact FJ but my matching Q theta with this okay and so we don't have made the

1006
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:09,390
确切的FJ，但我的匹配Q theta可以，所以我们没有做
this okay and so we don't have made the factor of J to start with will be the

1007
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,840
开始的J因子将是theta的整个分布P
this okay and so we don't have made the factor of J to start with will be the

1008
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,210
开始的J因子将是theta的整个分布P
factor of J to start with will be the whole distribution P of theta and from

1009
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:14,220
开始的J因子将是theta的整个分布P
whole distribution P of theta and from that we can update the factor of J once

1010
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,430
一旦完成，我们就可以更新J的因子，以及近似值
whole distribution P of theta and from that we can update the factor of J once

1011
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:19,250
一旦完成，我们就可以更新J的因子，以及近似值
that we can update the factor of J once we're done and and the approximation

1012
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:19,260
一旦完成，我们就可以更新J的因子，以及近似值
we're done and and the approximation again is given on the bottom so I had

1013
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:26,750
再次在底部给出，所以我有服务，所以想一下就如你所知
we're done and and the approximation again is given on the bottom so I had

1014
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:31,790
再次在底部给出，所以我有服务，所以想一下就如你所知
again is given on the bottom so I had services so think of this as you know

1015
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:31,800
再次在底部给出，所以我有服务，所以想一下就如你所知
services so think of this as you know let's say that this is the exact J

1016
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,000
假设这是确切的J，这就是您所知道的
services so think of this as you know let's say that this is the exact J

1017
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:43,060
假设这是确切的J，这就是您所知道的
let's say that this is the exact J alright and this is what the you know

1018
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,070
假设这是确切的J，这就是您所知道的
alright and this is what the you know doing so can you imagine a liberal and

1019
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,920
这样做，您可以想象一个自由主义者，然后您尝试去掌握它，这有点像
alright and this is what the you know doing so can you imagine a liberal and

1020
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,320
这样做，您可以想象一个自由主义者，然后您尝试去掌握它，这有点像
doing so can you imagine a liberal and you try to master so this is sort of an

1021
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:49,330
这样做，您可以想象一个自由主义者，然后您尝试去掌握它，这有点像
you try to master so this is sort of an right Victoria here if you try to

1022
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,040
在维多利亚这里，如果您尝试进行优化以将其标记为蓝色
you try to master so this is sort of an right Victoria here if you try to

1023
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,810
在维多利亚这里，如果您尝试进行优化以将其标记为蓝色
right Victoria here if you try to optimize a terribly to mark this blue

1024
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:57,820
在维多利亚这里，如果您尝试进行优化以将其标记为蓝色
optimize a terribly to mark this blue distribution giving it something that

1025
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,120
分布使它看起来像一个重磅炸弹，但
optimize a terribly to mark this blue distribution giving it something that

1026
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,710
分布使它看起来像一个重磅炸弹，但
distribution giving it something that looks like a bombshell but the

1027
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:03,720
分布使它看起来像一个重磅炸弹，但
looks like a bombshell but the distribution is this far away from her

1028
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,510
分布离她的论文还很远，所以现在要做的是
looks like a bombshell but the distribution is this far away from her

1029
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:11,700
分布离她的论文还很远，所以现在要做的是
distribution is this far away from her essay okay so now what that does is

1030
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:11,710
分布离她的论文还很远，所以现在要做的是
essay okay so now what that does is impose the approximation of the factor

1031
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,980
施加今天因素的近似值，以便在
essay okay so now what that does is impose the approximation of the factor

1032
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,620
施加今天因素的近似值，以便在
impose the approximation of the factor today to be closer sampling between

1033
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:16,630
施加今天因素的近似值，以便在
today to be closer sampling between alright and the approximation for the

1034
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,770
好吧，食物分配的近似值基本上就是
today to be closer sampling between alright and the approximation for the

1035
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:23,570
好吧，食物分配的近似值基本上就是
alright and the approximation for the food distribution basically terms it is

1036
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:23,580
好吧，食物分配的近似值基本上就是
food distribution basically terms it is you know the probability you know the

1037
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,530
你知道这个Q的非零概率域的概率
food distribution basically terms it is you know the probability you know the

你知道这个Q的非零概率域的概率
you know the probability you know the nonzero probability domain of this Q

1039
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:31,480
你知道这个Q的非零概率域的概率
nonzero probability domain of this Q minus a distribution so by the way you

1040
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,850
减去分布，这样您就可以在这里看到我告诉的符号
nonzero probability domain of this Q minus a distribution so by the way you

1041
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,800
减去分布，这样您就可以在这里看到我告诉的符号

1042
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:37,810
减去分布，这样您就可以在这里看到我告诉的符号
can see here the notation that I told you it is very common that abhorrest

1043
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:41,370
你很常见，在描述什么是可恶的百万
can see here the notation that I told you it is very common that abhorrest

你很常见，在描述什么是可恶的百万
you it is very common that abhorrest million you know in describing what is

1045
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:44,080
你很常见，在描述什么是可恶的百万
million you know in describing what is going on so when you you know remember

1046
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,210
因此，当您知道我们匹配时，我们会计算一个新的
million you know in describing what is going on so when you you know remember

you may want to actually take this former so didn't have time this morning

1121
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,660
前者，所以今天早上没有时间再次验证他们十五。谢谢
you may want to actually take this former so didn't have time this morning

1123
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:16,290
前者，所以今天早上没有时间再次验证他们十五。谢谢
to verify them again fifteen thank relationship the two gaussians okay you

1124
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:18,800
关系两个高斯人好吧，你可以基本上得到一个气体和高斯
to verify them again fifteen thank relationship the two gaussians okay you

1125

关系两个高斯人好吧，你可以基本上得到一个气体和高斯
relationship the two gaussians okay you can you basically get a gas and Gaussian

1126
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:22,920
关系两个高斯人好吧，你可以基本上得到一个气体和高斯
can you basically get a gas and Gaussian right but you notice the variance is 1

1127
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,430
是的，但是您注意到方差是V上的1减去V上的1等于
can you basically get a gas and Gaussian right but you notice the variance is 1

1128
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,010
是的，但是您注意到方差是V上的1减去V上的1等于
right but you notice the variance is 1 over V 1 minus 1 over V to the want of

1129
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:28,020
是的，但是您注意到方差是V上的1减去V上的1等于
over V 1 minus 1 over V to the want of the vision of the balances of numerator

1130
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,950

1131
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:33,710
分子和分母的平衡的愿景，显然这可以

1132
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:33,720
分子和分母的平衡的愿景，显然这可以
and denominator and obviously this can be negative obviously can be negative

1133
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,970
消极显然可以是消极好的，所以这又不是问题，而是如何
and denominator and obviously this can be negative obviously can be negative

1134
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:42,950
消极显然可以是消极好的，所以这又不是问题，而是如何
be negative obviously can be negative okay so again it is not an issue but how

1135
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:42,960
消极显然可以是消极好的，所以这又不是问题，而是如何
okay so again it is not an issue but how you program this is something you need

1136
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,599
您对此进行编程，需要非常谨慎，所以
okay so again it is not an issue but how you program this is something you need

1137
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:47,450
您对此进行编程，需要非常谨慎，所以
you program this is something you need to be sort of very careful alright so

1138
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:47,460
您对此进行编程，需要非常谨慎，所以
to be sort of very careful alright so these are not your everyday couch

对了，这个近似值非常大，这是非常非常的，你知道吗，所以
right the approximation is very large this is a very this is you know okay so

1173
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:01,260
对了，这个近似值非常大，这是非常非常的，你知道吗，所以
this is a very this is you know okay so here the approximation is good and the

00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:12,390
非零，您可以看到蓝色的逼近度有多好，什么是
approximation looks the blue and what is it the the red they basically coincide

1180
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:16,370
红色，它们基本上在这里重合，现在您有一个杯子了
approximation looks the blue and what is it the the red they basically coincide

1181
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:18,980
红色，它们基本上在这里重合，现在您有一个杯子了
it the the red they basically coincide here now you have a mug out the context

1182
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:18,990
红色，它们基本上在这里重合，现在您有一个杯子了
here now you have a mug out the context that is much wider so you notice the

1183
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:22,010
那要宽得多，所以您注意到它不再是的近似值是
here now you have a mug out the context that is much wider so you notice the

1184
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,990
那要宽得多，所以您注意到它不再是的近似值是
that is much wider so you notice the approximation that it's not anymore is

1185
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:24,000
那要宽得多，所以您注意到它不再是的近似值是
approximation that it's not anymore is good right because this is very wide

1186
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,080
好的权利，因为这是很广泛的，这是可以预期的
approximation that it's not anymore is good right because this is very wide

1187
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,040
好的权利，因为这是很广泛的，这是可以预期的
good right because this is very wide this is to be expected

1188
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:28,050
好的权利，因为这是很广泛的，这是可以预期的
this is to be expected all right and similarly here yeah the

1189
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,920
好吧，在这里类似，是的，近似值开始基本偏离
this is to be expected all right and similarly here yeah the

1190
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,750
好吧，在这里类似，是的，近似值开始基本偏离
all right and similarly here yeah the approximation starts deviating basically

1191
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:32,760
好吧，在这里类似，是的，近似值开始基本偏离
approximation starts deviating basically it's not very good over the support so

1192
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,030
在支持方面不是很好，所以如果您的支持范围很窄
approximation starts deviating basically it's not very good over the support so

1193
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,530
在支持方面不是很好，所以如果您的支持范围很窄
it's not very good over the support so if you have a narrow support right

1194
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:36,540
在支持方面不是很好，所以如果您的支持范围很窄
if you have a narrow support right assuming you do inference right if your

1195
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,170
如果您的问题遍及整个领域，并且假设您推理正确，
if you have a narrow support right assuming you do inference right if your

1196
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,420
如果您的问题遍及整个领域，并且假设您推理正确，
assuming you do inference right if your problems all over the space and you have

1197
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:41,430
如果您的问题遍及整个领域，并且假设您推理正确，
problems all over the space and you have no data the issue that you get in

1198
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:45,740
没有数据，您在事后估算中遇到的问题
problems all over the space and you have no data the issue that you get in

1199
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,880
没有数据，您在事后估算中遇到的问题
no data the issue that you get in posterior estimation

1200
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:48,890
没有数据，您在事后估算中遇到的问题
posterior estimation all right for the last time all the

1201
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:52,539
最后一次没事吧
posterior estimation all right for the last time all the

1202
00:45:52,539 --> 00:45:53,019
最后一次没事吧
all right for the last time all the other

1203
00:45:53,019 --> 00:45:53,029
最后一次没事吧
other we're going to be moving away from this

1204
00:45:53,029 --> 00:45:55,059
我们将摆脱这种困扰，所以这就是它的样子
other we're going to be moving away from this

1205
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:58,829
我们将摆脱这种困扰，所以这就是它的样子
we're going to be moving away from this okay so this is what it looks

1206
00:45:58,829 --> 00:45:58,839
我们将摆脱这种困扰，所以这就是它的样子
okay so this is what it looks if you initialize all the factors right

1207
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,229
如果您初始化了所有因素，那么通常必须先从某些方面入手
okay so this is what it looks if you initialize all the factors right

1208
00:46:02,229 --> 00:46:04,539
如果您初始化了所有因素，那么通常必须先从某些方面入手
if you initialize all the factors right you have to start with something usually

1209
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:04,549
如果您初始化了所有因素，那么通常必须先从某些方面入手
you have to start with something usually if you can just put them all the big

1210
00:46:04,549 --> 00:46:06,190
如果你能把所有的大外星人都带进去，那么暴力就是这样
you have to start with something usually if you can just put them all the big

1211
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:10,960
如果你能把所有的大外星人都带进去，那么暴力就是这样
if you can just put them all the big aliens with some in and violence's so

1212
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:10,970
如果你能把所有的大外星人都带进去，那么暴力就是这样
aliens with some in and violence's so this is your approximation for the whole

1213
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:13,979
这是整个后验分布的近似值，然后开始
aliens with some in and violence's so this is your approximation for the whole

1214
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:17,019
这是整个后验分布的近似值，然后开始
this is your approximation for the whole posterior distribution then you start

1215
00:46:17,019 --> 00:46:17,029
这是整个后验分布的近似值，然后开始
posterior distribution then you start updating one faster at the time you

1216
00:46:17,029 --> 00:46:19,509
在您记得的时候更新一个快到十二个腔
posterior distribution then you start updating one faster at the time you

1217
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:22,900
在您记得的时候更新一个快到十二个腔
updating one faster at the time you remember to twelve this cavity

1218
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:22,910
在您记得的时候更新一个快到十二个腔
remember to twelve this cavity distribution Q minus J okay by dividing

1219
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:26,410
分配Q减去J可以，将Q自由度除以您做的Jake因子
remember to twelve this cavity distribution Q minus J okay by dividing

1220
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,989
分配Q减去J可以，将Q自由度除以您做的Jake因子
distribution Q minus J okay by dividing Q freedom with a factor of Jake you do

1221
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:28,999
分配Q减去J可以，将Q自由度除以您做的Jake因子
Q freedom with a factor of Jake you do one with matching two completely new you

1222
00:46:28,999 --> 00:46:31,299
一个与两个完全匹配的匹配，您可以为该计算归一化部分
Q freedom with a factor of Jake you do one with matching two completely new you

1223
00:46:31,299 --> 00:46:33,220
一个与两个完全匹配的匹配，您可以为该计算归一化部分
one with matching two completely new you compute this normalization part for the

1224
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:33,230
一个与两个完全匹配的匹配，您可以为该计算归一化部分
compute this normalization part for the update part of them is given by what you

1225
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:35,920
更新部分是由您所看到的给出，而不是您选择了所有
compute this normalization part for the update part of them is given by what you

see instead be you picked all the factors okay obviously you know if

1228
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:43,390
好的因素很明显，您知道您是否要继续迭代多个
see instead be you picked all the factors okay obviously you know if

1230
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:46,190
好的因素很明显，您知道您是否要继续迭代多个
you're gonna keep iterating multiple runs to be sure that let's efficient

1231

1417
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:13,430
然后，我们一定会爱上几分钟，所以我可以告诉您
a few minutes so I can tell you on extending this to to publish the

1418
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:16,370
扩展到发布图形模型，这样我们就可以
a few minutes so I can tell you on extending this to to publish the

1419

扩展到发布图形模型，这样我们就可以
extending this to to publish the graphical models so we can make

1420
00:54:18,769 --> 00:54:18,779
扩展到发布图形模型，这样我们就可以
graphical models so we can make connections with other algorithms so I

1421
00:54:18,779 --> 00:54:20,930
与其他算法的连接，所以我知道问题在于我们只想

1422
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:25,160
与其他算法的连接，所以我知道问题在于我们只想
connections with other algorithms so I know that the problem is we only want to

1423
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:25,170
与其他算法的连接，所以我知道问题在于我们只想
know that the problem is we only want to compute the the mean of this Gaussian so

1424
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:31,039
计算这个高斯的平均值，所以我们收集数据，但是数据基本上
know that the problem is we only want to compute the the mean of this Gaussian so

1425
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:33,349
计算这个高斯的平均值，所以我们收集数据，但是数据基本上
compute the the mean of this Gaussian so we collect data but the data basically

1426
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:33,359
计算这个高斯的平均值，所以我们收集数据，但是数据基本上
we collect data but the data basically are noisy because some of the data may

1427
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,170
之所以嘈杂，是因为某些数据可能来自这三位元
we collect data but the data basically are noisy because some of the data may

1428
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,269
之所以嘈杂，是因为某些数据可能来自这三位元
are noisy because some of the data may be coming from this three bit dollars in

1429
00:54:38,269 --> 00:54:38,279
之所以嘈杂，是因为某些数据可能来自这三位元
be coming from this three bit dollars in the submission but some of them can be

1430
00:54:38,279 --> 00:54:39,859
提交，但其中一些可能来自擅自占地者分布，所以
be coming from this three bit dollars in the submission but some of them can be

1431
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,349
提交，但其中一些可能来自擅自占地者分布，所以
the submission but some of them can be coming from the squatter distribution so

1432
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:42,359
提交，但其中一些可能来自擅自占地者分布，所以
coming from the squatter distribution so it can be completely relevant to the

1433
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:44,660
它可能与您想要估计的平均值完全相关，所以
coming from the squatter distribution so it can be completely relevant to the

1434
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,269
它可能与您想要估计的平均值完全相关，所以
it can be completely relevant to the mean that you want to estimate okay so

1435
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:47,279
它可能与您想要估计的平均值完全相关，所以
mean that you want to estimate okay so that's why this is called the clattering

1436
00:54:47,279 --> 00:54:48,710
这就是为什么我们将其称为“拍手问题”的原因
mean that you want to estimate okay so that's why this is called the clattering

1437
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:52,160
这就是为什么我们将其称为“拍手问题”的原因
that's why this is called the clattering problem we're going to put some prior on

1438
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:52,170
这就是为什么我们将其称为“拍手问题”的原因

obviously the UH normalized posterior looks like this it's like if we turbine

1442
00:54:57,539 --> 00:55:01,400
看起来像这样，如果我们的涡轮是高斯混合气，那么您有2个
obviously the UH normalized posterior looks like this it's like if we turbine

1443
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,079
看起来像这样，如果我们的涡轮是高斯混合气，那么您有2个
looks like this it's like if we turbine is a Gaussian mixture so you have 2 to

1444
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:03,089
看起来像这样，如果我们的涡轮是高斯混合气，那么您有2个
is a Gaussian mixture so you have 2 to the N terms so this is not something if

1445
00:55:03,089 --> 00:55:05,839
N个词，所以这不是什么可以与您一起使用的，因此您可以在此处查看是否

00:55:58,670 --> 00:55:58,680
所以我们要做的就是总结我们要取得的结果
gonna summarize the results we are going to take an approximation of pure theta

1475
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,620
将纯θ近似为多元高斯模型
gonna summarize the results we are going to take an approximation of pure theta

1476
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,670
将纯θ近似为多元高斯模型
to take an approximation of pure theta to be a multivariate Gaussian okay

1477
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:03,680
将纯θ近似为多元高斯模型
to be a multivariate Gaussian okay obviously this means the factors will be

1478
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,549
显然，这意味着因素也会
to be a multivariate Gaussian okay obviously this means the factors will be

1479
00:56:07,549 --> 00:56:08,580
显然，这意味着因素也会
obviously this means the factors will be also

1480
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:08,590
显然，这意味着因素也会
also thousands but in the spirit of what we

1481
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:11,790
数以千计，但本着我们讨论过的关于道奇的负面思想
also thousands but in the spirit of what we

1482
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:13,880
数以千计，但本着我们讨论过的关于道奇的负面思想
thousands but in the spirit of what we discussed about Dodgers with negative

1483
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:13,890
数以千计，但本着我们讨论过的关于道奇的负面思想
discussed about Dodgers with negative audience we are aggressive response of

1484
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:16,740
观众，我们正在积极地进行耐力冥想护理，并且
discussed about Dodgers with negative audience we are aggressive response of

1485
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:20,400
观众，我们正在积极地进行耐力冥想护理，并且
audience we are aggressive response of stamina meditation care and and the

1486
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:20,410
观众，我们正在积极地进行耐力冥想护理，并且
stamina meditation care and and the square exponential here for effectively

1487
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,320
此处平方平方有效地表示方差二元可以为负，因此
stamina meditation care and and the square exponential here for effectively

1488
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:26,010
此处平方平方有效地表示方差二元可以为负，因此
square exponential here for effectively that variance bien can be negative so

1489
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:26,020
此处平方平方有效地表示方差二元可以为负，因此
that variance bien can be negative so this notion I have been looking at them

1490
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,480
我一直在研究发行版的这个想法将是颠倒的
that variance bien can be negative so this notion I have been looking at them

1491
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,270
我一直在研究发行版的这个想法将是颠倒的
this notion I have been looking at them on distribution would be upside down

1492
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:30,280
我一直在研究发行版的这个想法将是颠倒的
on distribution would be upside down okay so you need to start this away from

1493
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:35,940
好的，所以您需要从一些初始化开始，例如
on distribution would be upside down okay so you need to start this away from

1494
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:40,230
好的，所以您需要从一些初始化开始，例如
okay so you need to start this away from with some initialization and for example

1495
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:40,240
好的，所以您需要从一些初始化开始，例如
with some initialization and for example you can say of this factors to be equal

1496
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,250
你可以说这个因素等于一个
with some initialization and for example you can say of this factors to be equal

1497
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:44,880
你可以说这个因素等于一个
you can say of this factors to be equal to one

1498
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:44,890
你可以说这个因素等于一个
to one that's what is discussed here okay this

1499
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:47,670
这就是这里讨论的内容，好吧，假设金属做的也一样
to one that's what is discussed here okay this

1500
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,320
这就是这里讨论的内容，好吧，假设金属做的也一样
that's what is discussed here okay this assume immensely metal does the same

1501
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:49,330
这就是这里讨论的内容，好吧，假设金属做的也一样
assume immensely metal does the same thing in approximating the fastest when

1502
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:51,570
停下来时最快的事情就是什么，所以你需要一些东西
assume immensely metal does the same thing in approximating the fastest when

1503
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:53,190
停下来时最快的事情就是什么，所以你需要一些东西
thing in approximating the fastest when you stop so you need to have something

1504
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:53,200
停下来时最快的事情就是什么，所以你需要一些东西
you stop so you need to have something to start with okay you follow the Eiger

1505
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,700
首先，如果您要更新，请遵循Eiger会说一个
you stop so you need to have something to start with okay you follow the Eiger

1506
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,440
首先，如果您要更新，请遵循Eiger会说一个
to start with okay you follow the Eiger if you're going to update would say one

1507
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:58,450
首先，如果您要更新，请遵循Eiger会说一个
if you're going to update would say one factor you form this cavity this

1508
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:00,690
因素，你形成这个腔这种情况，你的计算机组织你
if you're going to update would say one factor you form this cavity this

1509
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:03,540
因素，你形成这个腔这种情况，你的计算机组织你
factor you form this cavity this condition you computer organization you

1510
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:03,550

condition you computer organization you do moment marching you point in you and

1511
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:06,060
马上进去，指向你，然后你就有一个因素，所以
condition you computer organization you do moment marching you point in you and

1512
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,950
马上进去，指向你，然后你就有一个因素，所以

1513
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:07,960
马上进去，指向你，然后你就有一个因素，所以
then you have there is a factor so the question is if you have beta factor what

1514
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,310
问题是，如果您有β因子，则a的均值和方差是多少
then you have there is a factor so the question is if you have beta factor what

are trying to monitor this with a pen you are trying to actually concentrate

1597
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,340
您正在尝试真正地集中在该支持所在的地区
are trying to monitor this with a pen you are trying to actually concentrate

1598
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:28,170
您正在尝试真正地集中在该支持所在的地区
you are trying to actually concentrate in the region where the support of this

1599
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:28,180
您正在尝试真正地集中在该支持所在的地区
in the region where the support of this cavity distribution is which is here and

1600
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:30,210
空腔分布在这里，这就是近似值
in the region where the support of this cavity distribution is which is here and

1601
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,220
空腔分布在这里，这就是近似值
cavity distribution is which is here and that's what the approximation it's good

1602
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:32,230
空腔分布在这里，这就是近似值
that's what the approximation it's good the rest there's nothing you can do

1603
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:33,900
剩下的就没事做，从某种意义上说你不做
that's what the approximation it's good the rest there's nothing you can do

1604
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,900
剩下的就没事做，从某种意义上说你不做
the rest there's nothing you can do about okay and in some sense you don't

1605
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:36,910
剩下的就没事做，从某种意义上说你不做
about okay and in some sense you don't really care and similarly in this case

1606
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:41,130
真的很在乎，在这种情况下，罪犯在这里，你可以看到
about okay and in some sense you don't really care and similarly in this case

1607
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:44,940
真的很在乎，在这种情况下，罪犯在这里，你可以看到
really care and similarly in this case the convict is here that you can see the

1608
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:44,950
真的很在乎，在这种情况下，罪犯在这里，你可以看到
the convict is here that you can see the two approximation is not very well

1609
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:47,090
两个近似不是很好，几乎在那个区域它们重合，所以
the convict is here that you can see the two approximation is not very well

1610
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:53,330
两个近似不是很好，几乎在那个区域它们重合，所以
two approximation is not very well almost they coincide in that region so

1611
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:53,340
两个近似不是很好，几乎在那个区域它们重合，所以
almost they coincide in that region so it's actually for the clutter problem

1612
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,770
实际上是为了解决混乱的问题，它们是Python代码的一部分，因此
almost they coincide in that region so it's actually for the clutter problem

1613
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:59,220
实际上是为了解决混乱的问题，它们是Python代码的一部分，因此
it's actually for the clutter problem they are in part of the Python code so

1614
01:00:59,220 --> 01:00:59,230
实际上是为了解决混乱的问题，它们是Python代码的一部分，因此
they are in part of the Python code so you can if you do variation of a is you

1615
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:02,130
如果可以做a的变体，则可以使用拉普拉斯逼近法
they are in part of the Python code so you can if you do variation of a is you

1616
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,710
如果可以做a的变体，则可以使用拉普拉斯逼近法
you can if you do variation of a is you use Laplace approximation you can push

1617
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:04,720
如果可以做a的变体，则可以使用拉普拉斯逼近法
use Laplace approximation you can push it to as many days as you want to

1618
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,240
它要花很多天，基本上可以有效传播
use Laplace approximation you can push it to as many days as you want to

1619
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,220
它要花很多天，基本上可以有效传播
it to as many days as you want to basically it's proficient propagation

1620
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:08,230
它要花很多天，基本上可以有效传播
basically it's proficient propagation through this problem performance the

1621
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:09,870
通过这个问题表现最好
basically it's proficient propagation through this problem performance the

1622
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,300
通过这个问题表现最好
through this problem performance the best okay

1623
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:11,310
通过这个问题表现最好
best okay institutional coming around this

1624
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:13,350
机构解决了这个棘手的问题，因为他非常
best okay institutional coming around this

institutional coming around this grappling problem because he was very

1626
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:16,360
机构解决了这个棘手的问题，因为他非常
grappling problem because he was very easily programming they need to be

1629
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:20,290
轻松编程，他们需要完成所有分析工作，
completing everything was analytical and it was also a problem quite if he comes

1630
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,560
如果他能做到最好的话，这也是一个问题，也许你可以
completing everything was analytical and it was also a problem quite if he comes

1632
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:25,270
如果他能做到最好的话，这也是一个问题，也许你可以
to some of the best okay maybe you can do a problem that it becomes this for

1633
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:27,600
做一个问题，这对你来说不是最好的
to some of the best okay maybe you can do a problem that it becomes this for

1634
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,300
做一个问题，这对你来说不是最好的
do a problem that it becomes this for you are not the best

1635
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:36,010
好的，因为我们基本上是在更新与

1636
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:36,020
好的，因为我们基本上是在更新与


1637
01:01:36,020 --> 01:02:58,130
好的，因为我们基本上是在更新与
okay we have because we basically be updating information related to

1638
01:02:58,130 --> 01:02:58,140
好的，因为我们基本上是在更新与
updating information related to variables X 1 and X 2 ok nothing else

1639
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:01,490
变量X 1和X 2没关系，因此可以以某种方式设想没有
updating information related to variables X 1 and X 2 ok nothing else

01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:06,850
变量X 1和X 2没关系，因此可以以某种方式设想没有
variables X 1 and X 2 ok nothing else so can somehow envision that there is no

1641
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:06,860
变量X 1和X 2没关系，因此可以以某种方式设想没有
so can somehow envision that there is no expectation propagation language that's

1642
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:09,440
期望传播语言，这就是今天演讲的标题的原因
so can somehow envision that there is no expectation propagation language that's

1643
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,690
期望传播语言，这就是今天演讲的标题的原因
expectation propagation language that's why the title of the presentation today

1644
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:11,700
期望传播语言，这就是今天演讲的标题的原因
why the title of the presentation today was local variation fluctuations where

1645
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,570
是局部变化的波动，整个事物以某种方式崩溃
why the title of the presentation today was local variation fluctuations where

1646
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:17,360
是局部变化的波动，整个事物以某种方式崩溃
was local variation fluctuations where somehow the whole thing collapses to

1647
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:17,370
是局部变化的波动，整个事物以某种方式崩溃
somehow the whole thing collapses to allow us to do an update here and update

1648
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:19,160
允许我们在这里进行更新并在那里更新并更新他们的等等，甚至
somehow the whole thing collapses to allow us to do an update here and update

允许我们在这里进行更新并在那里更新并更新他们的等等，甚至
allow us to do an update here and update there and update their etc and even

1650
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:22,020
允许我们在这里进行更新并在那里更新并更新他们的等等，甚至
there and update their etc and even further actually if you so let's say

1651
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:28,760
实际上，如果您这样说x1 x2的理论函数，也许您
there and update their etc and even further actually if you so let's say

1652
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:32,210
实际上，如果您这样说x1 x2的理论函数，也许您
further actually if you so let's say a theorist function of x1 x2 maybe you

1653
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:32,220
实际上，如果您这样说x1 x2的理论函数，也许您
a theorist function of x1 x2 maybe you can even fertilize this 2 factor of x 1

1654
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,790
甚至可以施肥2倍x 1，所以你可以有一个聚酯
a theorist function of x1 x2 maybe you can even fertilize this 2 factor of x 1

1655
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:36,380

1656
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:36,390
甚至可以施肥2倍x 1，所以你可以有一个聚酯
so you can have a polyester approximation as 1/4 - 20 X 1 and in all

1657
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:39,680
近似为1/4-20 X 1以及所有X 2的因数，类似地，在这里

1662
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:46,500
X 2的功能还有其他功能X 4的功能可以更新吗
the function of X 4 can you update each of them separately

1663
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,990
他们每个人都可以，您可以更新每个人吗
the function of X 4 can you update each of them separately

1665
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:50,520
他们每个人都可以，您可以更新每个人吗
ok can you update each of them separately - it's amazing you will say

1666
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,930
分开-令人惊讶的是，您会说我能猜出答案是，您是
