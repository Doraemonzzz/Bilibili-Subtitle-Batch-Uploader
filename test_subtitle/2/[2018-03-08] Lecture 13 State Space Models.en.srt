1
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:18,430
all right before we start some announcements on the next lecture

2
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,719
announcements on the next lecture actually we're going to camp the scary

3
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:24,520
actually we're going to camp the scary CICS seminar because the speaker

4
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,770
CICS seminar because the speaker couldn't come on Monday so if you show

5
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,200
couldn't come on Monday so if you show up on the first thing you see the lots

6
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,840
up on the first thing you see the lots of strangers just keep in mind they're

7
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,940
of strangers just keep in mind they're strangers to me as well because I would

8
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,280
strangers to me as well because I would have never seen them before

9
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,040
have never seen them before but because of the particular talk they

10
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,250
but because of the particular talk they will show up ok so that's not a reason

11
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,600
will show up ok so that's not a reason to hide because there's going to be a

12
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,469
to hide because there's going to be a big crowd

13
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:49,030
big crowd ok so the top is going to be learning

14
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,630
ok so the top is going to be learning member the exact title about uncertainty

15
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,460
member the exact title about uncertainty qualification in some applications

16
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,340
qualification in some applications related community knowledge but the

17
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,440
related community knowledge but the theme obviously would be very general so

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,010
theme obviously would be very general so be very much related at least to a

19
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:10,400
be very much related at least to a subject of this class all right

20
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,320
subject of this class all right we haven't really finished with a hidden

21
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,210
we haven't really finished with a hidden Markov model there's way too much stuff

22
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,550
Markov model there's way too much stuff to do but they decided to just take a

23
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,040
to do but they decided to just take a break and move a little bit forward to

24
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,100
break and move a little bit forward to cover database models to be sure that we

25
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,160
cover database models to be sure that we don't stay behind and if there is time

26
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,460
don't stay behind and if there is time we're going to come back to cover

27
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,780
we're going to come back to cover basically to remind you that all this

28
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,270
basically to remind you that all this mess is passing algorithms we did they

29
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,520
mess is passing algorithms we did they give you the same result or the

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,260
give you the same result or the alpha-beta messed resistors we cover

31
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,420
alpha-beta messed resistors we cover them in in the last two lectures and

32
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,930
them in in the last two lectures and also I wanted to give you

33
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,160
also I wanted to give you generalizations of hmm which are very

34
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,500
generalizations of hmm which are very practical lots of applications and I

35
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,240
practical lots of applications and I don't any of you is doing any project in

36
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,150
don't any of you is doing any project in that area but somehow you know somehow I

37
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,730
that area but somehow you know somehow I know there is to analyze to do very

38
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,520
know there is to analyze to do very complicated projects and they don't like

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,040
complicated projects and they don't like the simple thing because in the simple

40
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,380
the simple thing because in the simple things you can find the truth in the

41
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,790
things you can find the truth in the complicated things you are lost

42
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,730
complicated things you are lost all right I like simple things right I

43
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,790
all right I like simple things right I can see smile there so I like simple

44
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,910
can see smile there so I like simple project and every time even from the

45
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,550
project and every time even from the distances sorry my colonic I say I want

46
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,770
distances sorry my colonic I say I want something trivial for Donnelly's you

47
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,250
something trivial for Donnelly's you know people want to design bridges that

48
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,760
know people want to design bridges that by bit because it looks good right

49
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,540
by bit because it looks good right correct are you designing any bridge any

50
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,130
correct are you designing any bridge any fire rising building no all right okay

51
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,900
fire rising building no all right okay so we've discussed some of state-space

52
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,410
so we've discussed some of state-space models today as an introduction this is

53
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,810
models today as an introduction this is part sort of this general theme of using

54
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:50,300
part sort of this general theme of using probabilistic graphical models for data

55
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,220
probabilistic graphical models for data oriented problems and this concept is so

56
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,400
oriented problems and this concept is so fundamental basically you know maybe the

57
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,020
fundamental basically you know maybe the problem has nothing to do with

58
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,810
problem has nothing to do with state-space models but you can transform

59
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,940
state-space models but you can transform it in a way that you can utilize some of

60
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,770
it in a way that you can utilize some of these algorithms and I'm gonna show you

61
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,900
these algorithms and I'm gonna show you a little example of doing Bayesian

62
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,420
a little example of doing Bayesian inference to find the posterior of some

63
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,349
inference to find the posterior of some parameters with no dynamics and we can

64
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:17,580
parameters with no dynamics and we can these things we are going to learn today

65
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,509
these things we are going to learn today to do Bayesian inference you can even do

66
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,640
to do Bayesian inference you can even do near things you can do time integration

67
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,270
near things you can do time integration of all these using state space projects

68
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,670
of all these using state space projects and actually that's a very interesting

69
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,080
and actually that's a very interesting area even even accurate research alright

70
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,770
area even even accurate research alright show the slides I'm not done yet but

71
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,839
show the slides I'm not done yet but actually be hmm sliced but hopefully you

72
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,320
actually be hmm sliced but hopefully you got from by email am almost three slides

73
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,499
got from by email am almost three slides left to detect the three slides okay I

74
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:47,879
left to detect the three slides okay I don't want to post them because every

75
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,770
don't want to post them because every time I look there's another mistake I

76
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,600
time I look there's another mistake I have to correct okay so there are three

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,560
have to correct okay so there are three slides and I will post a stand and the

78
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,830
slides and I will post a stand and the missing lectures have very short so this

79
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,360
missing lectures have very short so this state space what those lectures are

80
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,110
state space what those lectures are almost done

81
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,159
almost done so if not posted I will send you an

82
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:09,260
so if not posted I will send you an email with them all right

83
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:09,270


84
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,760
hmm versus SSM basically the graphical model is identical would have an

85
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,730
model is identical would have an evolving state Z so that's how a

86
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,159
evolving state Z so that's how a dynamical system and then we have some

87
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:22,770
dynamical system and then we have some noisy observations that there why the

88
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,689
noisy observations that there why the only difference chromate some enemies in

89
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:28,430
only difference chromate some enemies in the hmm model like you know in the

90
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,210
the hmm model like you know in the simulator Gaussian mixture model

91
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,790
simulator Gaussian mixture model dismissive oliver's will discrete here

92
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,920
dismissive oliver's will discrete here the C variables are continuous that's

93
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,850
the C variables are continuous that's the only difference

94
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,189
the only difference okay so in addition to just make things

95
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:43,499
okay so in addition to just make things a little bit more interesting we have

96
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:46,140
a little bit more interesting we have sort of introduced in both the dynamical

97
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,420
sort of introduced in both the dynamical and the observation model some impede

98
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,210
and the observation model some impede variable you that you can think of it

99
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,820
variable you that you can think of it being sort of some crossing term that

100
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,390
being sort of some crossing term that you prescribe alright the hotel is not

101
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,999
you prescribe alright the hotel is not there there is nothing that it falls

102
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:02,390
there there is nothing that it falls back to the previous models we had so

103
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,450
back to the previous models we had so the general assistant model we have the

104
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,370
the general assistant model we have the dynamic described by this equation in a

105
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,320
dynamic described by this equation in a very general form we're going to

106
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,469
very general form we're going to simplify of course so that this is some

107
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:17,940
simplify of course so that this is some easy function to work

108
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,990
easy function to work so here is the input city - one of the

109
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,030
so here is the input city - one of the state that the - Rana and some noise and

110
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,780
state that the - Rana and some noise and the observations basically also has a

111
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,710
the observations basically also has a u-turn it depends only on Z at the same

112
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:37,290
u-turn it depends only on Z at the same time T it has its own noise as well so

113
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,200
time T it has its own noise as well so really very so this is identical to what

114
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,350
really very so this is identical to what we did with hmm actually hmm we said you

115
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,510
we did with hmm actually hmm we said you can put there's an observation anything

116
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,490
can put there's an observation anything you want to and we did the case for

117
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,470
you want to and we did the case for example with a Gaussian model but right

118
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,080
example with a Gaussian model but right now this can be a Gaussian and this can

119
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:03,240
now this can be a Gaussian and this can be a Gaucher all right okay sort of a

120
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,240
be a Gaucher all right okay sort of a number of problems that they are started

121
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,050
number of problems that they are started in the context of data simulation and

122
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,030
in the context of data simulation and best ones are identical for SSM okay so

123
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,040
best ones are identical for SSM okay so the what's the name we gave to

124
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,400
the what's the name we gave to estimating this how do we call this

125
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,210
estimating this how do we call this distribution

126
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:24,220


127
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:31,230
what's the name we gave to that and it's universal name I mean you need to know

128
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,330
universal name I mean you need to know this because it comes to everywhere so

129
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,890
this because it comes to everywhere so what they did we call how do we call

130
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,200
what they did we call how do we call this distribution

131
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,210
this distribution it's a posterior of the stage right but

132
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,970
it's a posterior of the stage right but we gave a name we call it something in

133
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,370
we gave a name we call it something in the little children you will see it with

134
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,250
the little children you will see it with the name what's the name it's not the

135
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,650
the name what's the name it's not the name of neutral you know it's a name

136
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,510
name of neutral you know it's a name that defines in words what this

137
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:57,350
that defines in words what this distribution is about so what was it

138
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360


139
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,510
uh-huh exactly

140
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:02,520


141
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,210
is the filtering distribution all right so this distribution is known as the

142
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,969
so this distribution is known as the filtering distribution okay

143
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:12,619
filtering distribution okay we discuss about the smoking

144
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:14,059
we discuss about the smoking distribution I think I'm going to come

145
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:16,969
distribution I think I'm going to come back to it so in the in this morning

146
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:19,700
back to it so in the in this morning distribution is basically the estimation

147
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,589
distribution is basically the estimation of ZT but instead of using data up to

148
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:23,659
of ZT but instead of using data up to time T you have all the data up to the

149
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:24,439
time T you have all the data up to the end

150
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:27,290
end capital T okay so this is the filtering

151
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,510
capital T okay so this is the filtering distribution and of course this is the

152
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,730
distribution and of course this is the prediction distribution where you don't

153
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,670
prediction distribution where you don't really care about Z by making a lots of

154
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,589
really care about Z by making a lots of promise but you want to know what's the

155
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,630
promise but you want to know what's the probability of your next measurement if

156
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,360
probability of your next measurement if you already have data up to time T right

157
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,000
you already have data up to time T right so there's all the points we did for hmm

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,240
so there's all the points we did for hmm are basically the same problems in any

159
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,389
are basically the same problems in any data stimulation case okay if it is hmm

160
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:52,790
data stimulation case okay if it is hmm masters time or anything else the same

161
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,199
masters time or anything else the same sort of problems with power printers

162
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:58,880
sort of problems with power printers okay the most standard problem all right

163
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,660
okay the most standard problem all right and maybe any students from Electrical

164
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,400
and maybe any students from Electrical Engineering maybe you guys have taking

165
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,660
Engineering maybe you guys have taking the cost on linear filtering or

166
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,250
the cost on linear filtering or something is there any quote from linear

167
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,190
something is there any quote from linear systems there is something common

168
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,889
systems there is something common filtering is anybody teaching us alright

169
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,610
filtering is anybody teaching us alright so so when you spend very little time to

170
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,760
so so when you spend very little time to discuss this of this today the good news

171
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,810
discuss this of this today the good news right is the previous equations that are

172
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,030
right is the previous equations that are implied by the color filtering for

173
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,160
implied by the color filtering for linear systems you can actually derive

174
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,910
linear systems you can actually derive them with belief propagation and in the

175
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,470
them with belief propagation and in the case of belief propagation you can

176
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,389
case of belief propagation you can derive all the equations for all the

177
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:40,699
derive all the equations for all the filtering both in distributions

178
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:43,130
filtering both in distributions everything you're interested even if the

179
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,780
everything you're interested even if the dynamics are nonlinear even if you

180
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,000
dynamics are nonlinear even if you observation model is non Gaussian so you

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,730
observation model is non Gaussian so you can do anything you want to okay but

182
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,949
can do anything you want to okay but today we're going to be very elementary

183
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:53,449
today we're going to be very elementary with a little bit of course a

184
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:55,790
with a little bit of course a probabilistic graphical taste to discuss

185
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,020
probabilistic graphical taste to discuss a linear Gaussian model now it's linear

186
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,760
a linear Gaussian model now it's linear you notice the evolution of the dynamics

187
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,650
you notice the evolution of the dynamics is the unit of this matrix a and B

188
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,420
is the unit of this matrix a and B they're functions of time that they

189
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,000
they're functions of time that they don't depend on the state C we will

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,580
don't depend on the state C we will actually discuss this after Spring Break

191
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,860
actually discuss this after Spring Break on how we're going to extend this 1

192
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,460
on how we're going to extend this 1 billion be a function of Z the

193
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,260
billion be a function of Z the observation model again it's linear and

194
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,980
observation model again it's linear and the noise is Gaussian you can ask you

195
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,660
the noise is Gaussian you can ask you meant right on if you can just looking

196
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,120
meant right on if you can just looking at this equation if the noise but lives

197
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,670
at this equation if the noise but lives this is Gaussian then we're all good

198
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,250
this is Gaussian then we're all good chances all distributions of interest

199
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,550
chances all distributions of interest will be Gaussian all right now if you

200
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,330
will be Gaussian all right now if you can assume that and actually forced a

201
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,410
can assume that and actually forced a methodology to give you the mean and the

202
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,970
methodology to give you the mean and the variance or the different distributions

203
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,710
variance or the different distributions and say oh that's the filtering

204
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,200
and say oh that's the filtering distribution that's the smoothing

205
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,310
distribution that's the smoothing distribution but it would be nicer if

206
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,310
distribution but it would be nicer if you actually you know do some algebra to

207
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,530
you actually you know do some algebra to show that the distributions of interest

208
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,580
show that the distributions of interest are gouging now in some formulas these

209
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,500
are gouging now in some formulas these matrices don't have a subscript T which

210
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,830
matrices don't have a subscript T which means the don't depend on the index P or

211
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,220
means the don't depend on the index P or tying the tray so in this case this V a

212
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,110
tying the tray so in this case this V a Gaussian model is especially our problem

213
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,050
Gaussian model is especially our problem right

214
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,060


215
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:15,740
sanitation maybe I need to have this expression in the slides when we hide

216
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,350
expression in the slides when we hide distributions and if we serve today in

217
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,460
distributions and if we serve today in the lecture everything is going to be

218
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,710
the lecture everything is going to be Gaussian

219
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,480
Gaussian when can I use to describe means and

220
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,270
when can I use to describe means and variances to subscribe

221
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,790
variances to subscribe the first one will refer to what time we

222
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,950
the first one will refer to what time we do the estimation of the state so in

223
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,900
do the estimation of the state so in this case you know this is time T and

224
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,470
this case you know this is time T and the central index will refer to the time

225
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,150
the central index will refer to the time scale where we have data so in this case

226
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,680
scale where we have data so in this case is from time 1 to T

227
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,230
is from time 1 to T all right so for example if this little

228
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,320
all right so for example if this little P was a capital T that will be the

229
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,310
P was a capital T that will be the smoking distribution you see it all

230
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,200
smoking distribution you see it all right so the notation the indices here

231
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,550
right so the notation the indices here are very important if the indices

232
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,940
are very important if the indices changed with values for this mu and

233
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,170
changed with values for this mu and Sigma are completely different

234
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,150
Sigma are completely different again the first T is the estimation time

235
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,769
again the first T is the estimation time we have to make here the fear of City

236
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:10,820
we have to make here the fear of City the second T is the time that after

237
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,590
the second T is the time that after which we have collection of data in this

238
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:18,019
which we have collection of data in this case want to community okay so obviously

239
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:20,389
case want to community okay so obviously for this linear system the the problem

240
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:22,100
for this linear system the the problem is known as the Kalman filtering problem

241
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,260
is known as the Kalman filtering problem but is that so secondary importance to

242
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,220
but is that so secondary importance to to our lecture today

243
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,560
to our lecture today so let's know some trivial examples I

244
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,180
so let's know some trivial examples I mean literally you can find books on the

245
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,840
mean literally you can find books on the subject you know and you

246
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:40,850


247
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:45,500
I don't know probabilistic robotics or something the whole subject area is

248
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,090
something the whole subject area is about this the same festival ok so this

249
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,990
about this the same festival ok so this is an example of object marking so let's

250
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,900
is an example of object marking so let's say you're tracking and a missile and

251
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,260
say you're tracking and a missile and you're interested on a state that is

252
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,660
you're interested on a state that is defined basically by the location of the

253
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,350
defined basically by the location of the missile

254
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,180
missile this is sort of a Miss I won't even a

255
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,570
this is sort of a Miss I won't even a plane another stupid problem in the

256
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,090
plane another stupid problem in the rotation here but Z 1 T and Z 2 T you

257
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,650
rotation here but Z 1 T and Z 2 T you can think being X my location and 0 1

258
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,079
can think being X my location and 0 1 and 0 to being the speeds in the x and y

259
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,170
and 0 to being the speeds in the x and y direction okay you are really

260
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,140
direction okay you are really interesting to compute all of this

261
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,100
interesting to compute all of this independently because you have to

262
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,750
independently because you have to calculate somehow let's say to the

263
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,610
calculate somehow let's say to the lastest and then you try to do

264
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,710
lastest and then you try to do integration on this you're not going to

265
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,199
integration on this you're not going to get very accurate results right because

266
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:34,300
get very accurate results right because then we are going to have to worry about

267
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,920
then we are going to have to worry about error of integration of differentiation

268
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,870
error of integration of differentiation depending what variables we take country

269
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,560
depending what variables we take country so kills these both the location and the

270
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,530
so kills these both the location and the speed of the object but what we need to

271
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,050
speed of the object but what we need to talk so the dynamical problem looks like

272
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,360
talk so the dynamical problem looks like this ok and I'm going to give you

273
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,949
this ok and I'm going to give you explicitly so you can convince

274
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:54,400
explicitly so you can convince yourselves that there's nothing really

275
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,329
yourselves that there's nothing really complicated so again 0 1 let's forget

276
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:02,180
complicated so again 0 1 let's forget that busy one is the explication the Y

277
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,000
that busy one is the explication the Y location so if you look at the the first

278
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,820
location so if you look at the the first equation this one

279
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,830
equation this one this Plus this knowledge it stays that

280
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,770
this Plus this knowledge it stays that the actual location is the X location of

281
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,660
the actual location is the X location of the previous time plus Delta which is

282
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,400
the previous time plus Delta which is the time step you can film of

283
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,530
the time step you can film of integration times the velocity of the

284
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,280
integration times the velocity of the previous time

285
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,660
previous time this is like an explicit time

286
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,460
this is like an explicit time integration scheme okay and then you

287
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,130
integration scheme okay and then you have some Gaussian noise and in the

288
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,480
have some Gaussian noise and in the context of the velocities you don't do

289
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,150
context of the velocities you don't do anything you say this velocity is the

290
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:35,340
anything you say this velocity is the previous velocity plus some notes okay

291
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,350


292
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:41,260
and the observations again it's a linear model like that so let's see exactly

293
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,690
model like that so let's see exactly what are the observations look like so

294
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,060
what are the observations look like so let's say you are observing the location

295
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,340
let's say you are observing the location of the missile so you basically want

296
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,920
of the missile so you basically want from this to Z vector to X plus Z 1 2

297
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,600
from this to Z vector to X plus Z 1 2 and Z 2 T so you basically have 1 1 and

298
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,730
and Z 2 T so you basically have 1 1 and the rest to 0 plus some noise okay a

299
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,590
the rest to 0 plus some noise okay a visit for that when I start that

300
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,270
visit for that when I start that everything is Gaussian right you have to

301
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,310
everything is Gaussian right you have to start with a distribution of the state

302
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,120
start with a distribution of the state also what is Gaussian because if I put

303
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,830
also what is Gaussian because if I put for the probability of G want to be

304
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,710
for the probability of G want to be somewhere distribution then good luck

305
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,600
somewhere distribution then good luck nothing is going to come to the Gaussian

306
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,730
nothing is going to come to the Gaussian ok so in this case P of Z 1 is Gaussian

307
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,010
ok so in this case P of Z 1 is Gaussian and again naught is the notation what

308
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,550
and again naught is the notation what this 1 0 means care in 1 0 winding is a

309
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,150
this 1 0 means care in 1 0 winding is a 0 there in this expression based on our

310
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:36,470
0 there in this expression based on our rotation

311
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480


312
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,659
so left the pie - what's the previous this is what we start with

313
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:46,929
this is what we start with what's the prior was there the Buddhist

314
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:50,150
what's the prior was there the Buddhist okay all right so there's a zero there

315
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,019
okay all right so there's a zero there okay and if your same basically but you

316
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,759
okay and if your same basically but you don't really have any information for

317
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,799
don't really have any information for the location of the missile to start

318
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,809
the location of the missile to start with right before you collect any data

319
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:04,639
with right before you collect any data you can assume that this is sort of an

320
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,629
you can assume that this is sort of an infinite if you like volumes from

321
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:14,059
infinite if you like volumes from basically the Sun can be anywhere so

322
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:18,019
basically the Sun can be anywhere so just to give you some preview results

323
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,909
just to give you some preview results and again you may want to go actually

324
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:24,530
and again you may want to go actually this is a homework and you guys have to

325
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,960
this is a homework and you guys have to extract this and program it you may want

326
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,299
extract this and program it you may want to actually run this trivial examples

327
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:33,319
to actually run this trivial examples from math is toolbox we take exactly

328
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:35,809
from math is toolbox we take exactly five seconds to look at the program and

329
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:39,049
five seconds to look at the program and see five lines you can actually

330
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:42,229
see five lines you can actually implement the equations we will discuss

331
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:45,729
implement the equations we will discuss today so the problem is basically

332
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:48,919
today so the problem is basically figuring out the part of a mistrial we

333
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,509
figuring out the part of a mistrial we have some knowledge of salvations which

334
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,449
have some knowledge of salvations which are this green circles all right this is

335
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:55,849
are this green circles all right this is the true path so it's more or less you

336
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,970
the true path so it's more or less you know the straight path in for y equal to

337
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,090
know the straight path in for y equal to ten but you try to estimate this from

338
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,870
ten but you try to estimate this from this noisy measurement so this is this

339
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,659
this noisy measurement so this is this little process you see are basically the

340
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:10,579
little process you see are basically the results of this filtering distribution

341
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,829
results of this filtering distribution okay so it looks knology actually if you

342
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,090
okay so it looks knology actually if you look at you know it goes up and down

343
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,519
look at you know it goes up and down etcetera this is way more smooth there

344
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,639
etcetera this is way more smooth there so an obviously you notice when you

345
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:24,439
so an obviously you notice when you start because you don't have any data

346
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,730
start because you don't have any data you know you rely on the prior basically

347
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,379
you know you rely on the prior basically the first step you're a little bit away

348
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:32,779
the first step you're a little bit away from well this is what you supposed to

349
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:35,720
from well this is what you supposed to be but it picks up quite fast okay so

350
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,490
be but it picks up quite fast okay so this is the filtering distributions of

351
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,500
this is the filtering distributions of sq if you assume that the data come

352
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,440
sq if you assume that the data come one of the time you can update that stay

353
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,240
one of the time you can update that stay for the Messiah list and and this is

354
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,050
for the Messiah list and and this is with the cities this crosses there if he

355
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,990
with the cities this crosses there if he does more thing actually you get very

356
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,750
does more thing actually you get very nice results so this is assuming picture

357
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,370
nice results so this is assuming picture of the swapping you know and you can

358
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,280
of the swapping you know and you can there is no you know there's no

359
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,690
there is no you know there's no salacious basically the results they

360
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,890
salacious basically the results they look pretty good

361
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,640
look pretty good okay so that's you know what if we call

362
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,020
okay so that's you know what if we call this more think you are basically

363
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,270
this more think you are basically stabilizing the problem by using nope

364
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,280
stabilizing the problem by using nope any current data but Twitter

365
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,700
any current data but Twitter observationally as well so this is this

366
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:24,520
observationally as well so this is this is the smoking distribution so let me

367
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,730
is the smoking distribution so let me discuss about this robotic slump problem

368
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,000
discuss about this robotic slump problem it's a standard problem and there's a

369
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,680
it's a standard problem and there's a whole book actually on the subject area

370
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,590
whole book actually on the subject area for those interested again if I asked is

371
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,330
for those interested again if I asked is anybody doing any project from this I

372
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,940
anybody doing any project from this I know the answer is no so let me define

373
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,060
know the answer is no so let me define the project for you so I put these

374
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,180
the project for you so I put these things all up well actually let me use

375
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,950
things all up well actually let me use this picture I'm gonna go backwards okay

376
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:56,890
this picture I'm gonna go backwards okay so that is moving right it does whatever

377
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,800
so that is moving right it does whatever tasks you have assigned to do it but it

378
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,530
tasks you have assigned to do it but it tries to identify brought location is at

379
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,350
tries to identify brought location is at this time and we denote this location as

380
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:14,470
this time and we denote this location as X okay abigai ting you have to put some

381
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,010
X okay abigai ting you have to put some markings and say there's a role player

382
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,630
markings and say there's a role player Subic is that don't work roles you know

383
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,690
Subic is that don't work roles you know a little student very I mean you need to

384
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,310
a little student very I mean you need to get some like you see this marking time

385
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,920
get some like you see this marking time this capital else okay

386
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,680
this capital else okay so literally that's how this little

387
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,110
so literally that's how this little robots that captain last work right we

388
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,590
robots that captain last work right we provide some markets in in your yard and

389
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,690
provide some markets in in your yard and there are more basically learns what it

390
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,770
there are more basically learns what it is and where it needs to go

391
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,540
is and where it needs to go to navigate through the space so this

392
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,110
to navigate through the space so this mark this long modest capital L and one

393
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,160
mark this long modest capital L and one L till they're a fixed location okay and

394
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,010
L till they're a fixed location okay and you provide them so the robot is trying

395
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,740
you provide them so the robot is trying to us to make quality satisfied by

396
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,570
to us to make quality satisfied by measuring its distance from this fixed

397
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:02,340
measuring its distance from this fixed long box so basically this is where it

398
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,620
long box so basically this is where it is right when it's around makes this

399
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,620
is right when it's around makes this realm want me to get elected this so in

400
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,930
realm want me to get elected this so in this case for example a time one it's

401
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,770
this case for example a time one it's just love mark one and one mark let's

402
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,380
just love mark one and one mark let's say to all the time to which this from

403
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,720
say to all the time to which this from the M 2 and x 3 l1 etc okay so the

404
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,870
the M 2 and x 3 l1 etc okay so the location is estimated using those

405
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:27,510
location is estimated using those yourselves now

406
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,910
yourselves now the observations right y1 y2 are these

407
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,810
the observations right y1 y2 are these distances from the landmarks okay and

408
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,130
distances from the landmarks okay and notice on the trying mark here the

409
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,720
notice on the trying mark here the observations to indicate that this is

410
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,770
observations to indicate that this is evidence notice something that N 1 and L

411
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,570
evidence notice something that N 1 and L 2 are not conditionally independent

412
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,750
2 are not conditionally independent given the evidence can you see that so

413
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,180
given the evidence can you see that so even though the landmarks of fixed right

414
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,250
even though the landmarks of fixed right they are not conditionally independent

415
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,250
they are not conditionally independent given the evidence and can you

416
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,050
given the evidence and can you I mean it's taste they are gonna read

417
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,050
I mean it's taste they are gonna read the Easter let me cover it right let me

418
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,830
the Easter let me cover it right let me put my body here all right so why n 1

419
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,920
put my body here all right so why n 1 and M 2 are not what you can read it

420
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,010
and M 2 are not what you can read it there

421
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,620
there so I don't help very much yl1 and help

422
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:20,950
so I don't help very much yl1 and help you are not independent given the watch

423
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960


424
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,250
you use the biggest ball algorithm and look at this probabilistic graphical

425
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,130
look at this probabilistic graphical model and tell me what makes l1 l2

426
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:37,330
model and tell me what makes l1 l2 dependent with the biggest ball angle

427
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:37,340


428
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:42,100
to do to prove conditional independence what is the biggest one tells you we

429
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,340
what is the biggest one tells you we need to do

430
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:47,350


431
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:53,370
take the ball and following some rules state there is a path connecting and 112

432
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,190
state there is a path connecting and 112 - so don't have a cop collecting l1 and

433
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:07,480
- so don't have a cop collecting l1 and l2 okay right snot blob there

434
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:07,490


435
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:15,100
with me the best the explained away situation right we have two causes all

436
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,250
situation right we have two causes all right that explain this all right so

437
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,070
right that explain this all right so actually given varus and 1 and X 1

438
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,080


439
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:29,769
independent okay so effectively the ball can go through

440
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:31,539
so effectively the ball can go through here can go through there can reach

441
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:35,289
here can go through there can reach there so this makes this problem study

442
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:39,669
there so this makes this problem study more complicated so given why these

443
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:42,990
more complicated so given why these elves are not conditional independent

444
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,190
elves are not conditional independent actually and when I'm gonna do this

445
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,350
actually and when I'm gonna do this unless someone decides or it has

446
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,110
unless someone decides or it has submitted a project from this an Isis

447
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,600
submitted a project from this an Isis ability to actually handle this and use

448
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,880
ability to actually handle this and use linear Gaussian systems is to write the

449
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,649
linear Gaussian systems is to write the probability of the prestigious let's say

450
00:22:59,649 --> 00:23:02,590
probability of the prestigious let's say hotel not only given Y but assuming that

451
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,799
hotel not only given Y but assuming that you given you are given X as well so

452
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:07,750
you given you are given X as well so then they become independent then you

453
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,760
then they become independent then you can use ideas from carbon filtering and

454
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,630
can use ideas from carbon filtering and sort of part of filter methods to come

455
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,720
sort of part of filter methods to come up with a very easy solution of this

456
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,620
up with a very easy solution of this okay I mean this is a little bit like a

457
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,409
okay I mean this is a little bit like a trivial problem right to handle but in

458
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:25,450
trivial problem right to handle but in the context of robotics but work on

459
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,810
the context of robotics but work on warehouses amazon.com you know where

460
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,970
warehouses amazon.com you know where they take books themselves here and find

461
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,980
they take books themselves here and find the next book and they navigate not

462
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,779
the next book and they navigate not hitting each other you know this is

463
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:40,029
hitting each other you know this is basically a trivial what implemented

464
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:43,269
basically a trivial what implemented maybe 10-15 years ago and those who did

465
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:45,610
maybe 10-15 years ago and those who did implement those became very rich okay

466
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,010
implement those became very rich okay and that includes want of my very young

467
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,700
and that includes want of my very young colleagues a few years ago to solve

468
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,269
colleagues a few years ago to solve basically his one-man company to observe

469
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:59,350
basically his one-man company to observe okay so you can these are very simple

470
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,980
okay so you can these are very simple algorithms but simple thing to pay

471
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,850
algorithms but simple thing to pay complicated things that don't pay

472
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,150
complicated things that don't pay because they're complicated and

473
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:12,170
because they're complicated and right alright so the observation model

474
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,420
right alright so the observation model right is the probability of Y given Z

475
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:22,590
right is the probability of Y given Z right so this motion model is the

476
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,960
right so this motion model is the probability of X this two dynamics okay

477
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,950
probability of X this two dynamics okay and so this is basically this filtering

478
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:37,020
and so this is basically this filtering distribution together with the other

479
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,000
distribution together with the other bars because this is a two dimensional

480
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,780
bars because this is a two dimensional problem right you get and and the you

481
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,220
problem right you get and and the you know the spilling distribution is a

482
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,710
know the spilling distribution is a Gaussian so basically you can draw an

483
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,400
Gaussian so basically you can draw an ellipse

484
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,730
ellipse all right around the mean of this

485
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,470
all right around the mean of this filtering distribution and you notice so

486
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,870
filtering distribution and you notice so you start from one location for you know

487
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,600
you start from one location for you know where you are and then the uncertainty

488
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,910
where you are and then the uncertainty actually grows but then as you come

489
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,560
actually grows but then as you come closer to something that we have seen

490
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,960
closer to something that we have seen before the uncertainties reduced

491
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,970
before the uncertainties reduced now if you don't even approach on the

492
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,430
now if you don't even approach on the same power because you are ready you not

493
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,110
same power because you are ready you not have collected a lot of data this is the

494
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,010
have collected a lot of data this is the smoothing problem this smoothing

495
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,360
smoothing problem this smoothing uncertainties will become very small all

496
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,700
uncertainties will become very small all right all the way back to the initial

497
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,400
right all the way back to the initial stage the implementation residual it was

498
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,570
stage the implementation residual it was literally ten large

499
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:29,030
literally ten large okay ten right

500
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,040


501
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:35,490
now let me just say a computation right because this sort of introduces the

502
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,310
because this sort of introduces the ideas also of dynamic graphical models

503
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:43,080
ideas also of dynamic graphical models that I donít we will discuss before the

504
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,960
that I donít we will discuss before the end of the semester but so what

505
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,140
end of the semester but so what so let me go back to this picture okay

506
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,850
so let me go back to this picture okay so you are measuring Y right and we try

507
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:59,130
so you are measuring Y right and we try to estimate this and the location

508
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,550
to estimate this and the location basically X we are basically at every

509
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,920
basically X we are basically at every instant so Ellen X is your state see

510
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,530
instant so Ellen X is your state see here the two things together is a thing

511
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:16,830
here the two things together is a thing Z and you try the stratum given Y all

512
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,140
Z and you try the stratum given Y all right let some locations you know what

513
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,760
right let some locations you know what there is you know can you tell me how

514
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,410
there is you know can you tell me how this diagram is going to involve with

515
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,930
this diagram is going to involve with time sorry what do you thing is is going

516
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:38,370
time sorry what do you thing is is going to happen but you see L 1 and L 2 so

517
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,260
to happen but you see L 1 and L 2 so your inference will involve L 1 and L 2

518
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,230
your inference will involve L 1 and L 2 then if you have some class the only

519
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,390
then if you have some class the only thing that you see is L to show your

520
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,390
thing that you see is L to show your state will involve only and 2 down there

521
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,330
state will involve only and 2 down there it will involve and 1 you know etc etc

522
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,200
it will involve and 1 you know etc etc so what happens is you move what happens

523
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,450
so what happens is you move what happens to so if you think that you a big

524
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,250
to so if you think that you a big correlation matrix that connects all

525
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,980
correlation matrix that connects all your elves and your axis what can you

526
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,110
your elves and your axis what can you tell me about that correlation matrix as

527
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,230
tell me about that correlation matrix as given to anything in time is it short of

528
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,940
given to anything in time is it short of everything correlates with everything or

529
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,180
everything correlates with everything or something happens as you move in I mean

530
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,850
something happens as you move in I mean you notice here again PI 1 and 1 and L 2

531
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,170
you notice here again PI 1 and 1 and L 2 are there time to and to here then L 1

532
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,590
are there time to and to here then L 1 so what can you tell me about the

533
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,240
so what can you tell me about the correlations that you have between the

534
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,780
correlations that you have between the tray the outs and the axis or even the

535
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,799
tray the outs and the axis or even the URLs themselves as you move with

536
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:39,670
URLs themselves as you move with are they changing

537
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:39,680


538
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:47,800
you remember that makes a little late it is the observations that you make well

539
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,900
is the observations that you make well sure you observe some pain that connects

540
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,000
sure you observe some pain that connects to the odd marks right so the

541
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,730
to the odd marks right so the correlation is very high you don't see a

542
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,470
correlation is very high you don't see a lot of life there is no correlation

543
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,050
lot of life there is no correlation whatsoever so you can think of the

544
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:02,320
whatsoever so you can think of the dynamical biscuit that represents what

545
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,310
dynamical biscuit that represents what you see here where the strength of the

546
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,690
you see here where the strength of the correlations moves with the girls

547
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,550
correlations moves with the girls so it's time some things that they were

548
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,610
so it's time some things that they were highly correlated become uncorrelated

549
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,350
highly correlated become uncorrelated writing they're basically significant

550
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:22,180
writing they're basically significant okay so so this basically falls in the

551
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,840
okay so so this basically falls in the category of a system that is it doesn't

552
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
category of a system that is it doesn't in with time so graph that is evolving

553
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,830
in with time so graph that is evolving with tiring so if you want to read more

554
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,770
with tiring so if you want to read more about this I recommend basically to read

555
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:37,120
about this I recommend basically to read this book on probabilistic slump so

556
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,830
this book on probabilistic slump so there is a reference on codeine in the

557
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:43,500
there is a reference on codeine in the north of this crisis card on this topic

558
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:43,510


559
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:50,620
and so you can see you know this is sort of a snapshot of the correlation matrix

560
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,300
of a snapshot of the correlation matrix that you get for the printing

561
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,490
that you get for the printing distribution you can see there's lots of

562
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,440
distribution you can see there's lots of zeroes there all right

563
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,720
zeroes there all right sixteen is parts so whatever happens

564
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,810
sixteen is parts so whatever happens with lament mister calculus part sitting

565
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:11,870
with lament mister calculus part sitting on the correlation matrix right

566
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:11,880


567
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,779
and obviously the people who became rich with this concept that actually that's

568
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:20,120
with this concept that actually that's the book I was referring to let me go

569
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,580
the book I was referring to let me go back alright so this is the book for

570
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,710
back alright so this is the book for those interested you actually download

571
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,440
those interested you actually download the whole PDF of redirected from the

572
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:35,480
the whole PDF of redirected from the author's website okay

573
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,470
author's website okay all right so let me convince you before

574
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,180
all right so let me convince you before we discuss anything in determining what

575
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,580
we discuss anything in determining what a state-space models are simple very

576
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,370
a state-space models are simple very powerful and you should make use of them

577
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,700
powerful and you should make use of them even if there is nothing that has

578
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,080
even if there is nothing that has anything to do with dynamics and

579
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,029
anything to do with dynamics and evolutions of faith and knowledge

580
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:55,460
evolutions of faith and knowledge observationally new business so let's

581
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,340
observationally new business so let's consider a Bayesian inference problem

582
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,200
consider a Bayesian inference problem well it doesn't matter what it is but

583
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,960
well it doesn't matter what it is but you try this made given some date of the

584
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,600
you try this made given some date of the posterior of some parameter theta in

585
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,600
posterior of some parameter theta in your motive okay can be anything okay

586
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,090
your motive okay can be anything okay there's no dance mixture okay so some is

587
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,230
there's no dance mixture okay so some is the wave you didn't base and things

588
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,940
the wave you didn't base and things you're going to put some prior bordeaux

589
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,600
you're going to put some prior bordeaux right so here's my prior and of course

590
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,750
right so here's my prior and of course we have some reservations and we're

591
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,789
we have some reservations and we're going to fly somehow to address this

592
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:30,110
going to fly somehow to address this problem with state space sort of

593
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:33,019
problem with state space sort of thinking now to do a state space

594
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:34,940
thinking now to do a state space thinking you have to pretend that there

595
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,880
thinking you have to pretend that there is dynamics of the problem and serve an

596
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,460
is dynamics of the problem and serve an address I am going to pretend that the

597
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,159
address I am going to pretend that the engagement is a dynamical evolution of

598
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:44,539
engagement is a dynamical evolution of the parameters theta so I'm going to

599
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:47,750
the parameters theta so I'm going to make theta to have a subscript P even

600
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,460
make theta to have a subscript P even though it is not me but you know I'm

601
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,940
though it is not me but you know I'm going to take this sort of as a an

602
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,130
going to take this sort of as a an iterative process in some index p and

603
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,529
iterative process in some index p and the dynamical problem is going to look

604
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:59,570
the dynamical problem is going to look like that the probability of P that be

605
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,210
like that the probability of P that be given to the t minus one is really that

606
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,950
given to the t minus one is really that the fraction of size P that this should

607
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,680
the fraction of size P that this should never change does not is how reasonable

608
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,560
never change does not is how reasonable to give right I mean if you have to do a

609
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,419
to give right I mean if you have to do a Bayesian inference and want us to make

610
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:13,940
Bayesian inference and want us to make parameters theta I mean you can't waste

611
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,950
parameters theta I mean you can't waste the time and assume that this term

612
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,049
the time and assume that this term dynamical problem for the parameters

613
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:23,240
dynamical problem for the parameters never change right so nobody killed it's

614
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,279
never change right so nobody killed it's like you're on again

615
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,930
like you're on again you may say I'm wasting my time

616
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,629
you may say I'm wasting my time let's see what a waste of time if it

617
00:31:31,629 --> 00:31:32,349
let's see what a waste of time if it pays off

618
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:38,169
pays off okay now in I'm going to show you now

619
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:40,749
okay now in I'm going to show you now right if you take the Sigma zero to be

620
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:42,820
right if you take the Sigma zero to be infinity the estimation for the

621
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,930
infinity the estimation for the parameter test here all right I'm not

622
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,129
parameter test here all right I'm not going to calculate the full posterior

623
00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:50,169
going to calculate the full posterior we're going to get the point estimate of

624
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:52,899
we're going to get the point estimate of the parameters theta but if this Sigma 0

625
00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:55,499
the parameters theta but if this Sigma 0 is basically infinity but wealth

626
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:59,799
is basically infinity but wealth provided metrics exactly we're going to

627
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:02,049
provided metrics exactly we're going to get a maximum likelihood estimate from

628
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:03,609
get a maximum likelihood estimate from this approach okay

629
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:05,259
this approach okay otherwise we're going to go directly and

630
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:12,249
otherwise we're going to go directly and get the solution to the linear system of

631
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:14,320
get the solution to the linear system of equations right so I'm giving you this

632
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,180
equations right so I'm giving you this sort of it as a demonstration of what is

633
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,450
sort of it as a demonstration of what is coming so when I tell your lots of

634
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,219
coming so when I tell your lots of questions crap you have to believe me

635
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:23,729
questions crap you have to believe me this is what's gonna come in okay so

636
00:32:23,729 --> 00:32:26,919
this is what's gonna come in okay so we're going to cover today in the

637
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:29,409
we're going to cover today in the lecture the exact time of filtering

638
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:31,930
lecture the exact time of filtering equations of how we computed the

639
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,119
equations of how we computed the filtering distribution so the postilion

640
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,389
filtering distribution so the postilion of Z given data from 1 to T the feeding

641
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,669
of Z given data from 1 to T the feeding distribution etc but I won't question

642
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:41,950
distribution etc but I won't question that I know somehow those equations and

643
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,259
that I know somehow those equations and I want to know what are they gonna do

644
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:46,060
I want to know what are they gonna do for me on this Bayesian inference

645
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,460
for me on this Bayesian inference problem in updating the parameters theta

646
00:32:48,460 --> 00:33:00,789
problem in updating the parameters theta and XI some magic comes out of it so the

647
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:03,399
and XI some magic comes out of it so the linear observation model was that YT is

648
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:11,739
linear observation model was that YT is equal to CT x ZT plus there was no you

649
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:15,669
equal to CT x ZT plus there was no you here plus some Gaussian noise with this

650
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:18,219
here plus some Gaussian noise with this barrier you remember there was a

651
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:24,729
barrier you remember there was a symmetry okay so all right so so this is

652
00:33:24,729 --> 00:33:27,700
symmetry okay so all right so so this is observational basically right so the

653
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,169
observational basically right so the observation order

654
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:34,100
observation order is a Gaussian okay and because this

655
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,580
is a Gaussian okay and because this noise is Gaussian the male is st. times

656
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,869
noise is Gaussian the male is st. times Z alright C times C and the variance is

657
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:48,859
Z alright C times C and the variance is Sigma square and so to see what I'm

658
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:57,499
Sigma square and so to see what I'm trying to do okay very specific case but

659
00:33:57,499 --> 00:33:59,840
trying to do okay very specific case but actually can be very generous ya think

660
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,680
actually can be very generous ya think that somehow some parameters in the

661
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:19,569
that somehow some parameters in the regression model okay

662
00:34:19,569 --> 00:34:19,579


663
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:24,589
and then you want sort of to compute the parameters in some linear regression

664
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:26,299
parameters in some linear regression problems that will allow you to compute

665
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:29,960
problems that will allow you to compute Y for any X so we can do any specific

666
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:35,210
Y for any X so we can do any specific okay think so if you want to compute the

667
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,879
okay think so if you want to compute the the observation model will depend on

668
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:41,270
the observation model will depend on what the input is and so the C matrix

669
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:46,669
what the input is and so the C matrix that I take here is X transpose all

670
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:49,399
that I take here is X transpose all right so X 2 is Pacific you know what it

671
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:50,930
right so X 2 is Pacific you know what it reminds you think of the regression

672
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:56,000
reminds you think of the regression model that is basically you know people

673
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,380
model that is basically you know people transpose x y4 v transpose X usually

674
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,849
transpose x y4 v transpose X usually when you write regression models you

675
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,819
when you write regression models you think of y equal W transpose X plus some

676
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:11,950
think of y equal W transpose X plus some noise so my darling is typically the

677
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:11,960


678
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:20,510
point is here right but why in the linear version in the linear system

679
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,450
linear version in the linear system model is three times Z plus a Gaussian

680
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:28,700
model is three times Z plus a Gaussian noise alright so I am taking Z this this

681
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,410
noise alright so I am taking Z this this way and now taking a state to the

682
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,299
way and now taking a state to the departmental stripped out but they make

683
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:36,470
departmental stripped out but they make them demonic this is what about

684
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:36,480


685
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,230
my symmetric system X - Parris is my eight my expression is to say because

686
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:51,980
eight my expression is to say because I'm going shopping as melody okay okay

687
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:58,700
I'm going shopping as melody okay okay in the linear regression model in verse

688
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,589
in the linear regression model in verse 4 let's say when the input is Malta it's

689
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:02,270
4 let's say when the input is Malta it's not one bit about the dimensional

690
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,800
not one bit about the dimensional problems right the external sports times

691
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,700
problems right the external sports times theta plus noise Sigma square so this is

692
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,310
theta plus noise Sigma square so this is my observation model basically okay so

693
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:14,780
my observation model basically okay so if I know the input the response depends

694
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:20,780
if I know the input the response depends on the state and the state is Theta I am

695
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,640
on the state and the state is Theta I am going to pretending now that the problem

696
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,870
going to pretending now that the problem is dynamic all right and this tucupi has

697
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:31,870
is dynamic all right and this tucupi has evolved dynamics somebody can write down

698
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:31,880


699
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:58,220
the distribution the distribution which is analytically know and we will derive

700
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:03,380
is analytically know and we will derive it today so it comes to be basically the

701
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,320
it today so it comes to be basically the meaning at the previous time remember

702
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,730
meaning at the previous time remember time here is dummy

703
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:12,380
time here is dummy alright times L transpose what is a

704
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:18,009
alright times L transpose what is a prosperous my problem

705
00:37:18,009 --> 00:37:18,019


706
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:23,809
remember she comes into the mission of the dynamical problem X equal a times Z

707
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:26,150
the dynamical problem X equal a times Z P miles wrong but when the mental

708
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:29,710
P miles wrong but when the mental problem is the mental function alright

709
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:35,480
problem is the mental function alright so here basically like an identity okay

710
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,829
so here basically like an identity okay so new T times so if I know the main at

711
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:42,440
so new T times so if I know the main at the previous time and I know this matrix

712
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,299
the previous time and I know this matrix to disk all the time and gain matrix

713
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:46,579
to disk all the time and gain matrix that we will derive gonna wanna give me

714
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:49,609
that we will derive gonna wanna give me an exact expression truthfully I can

715
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:52,160
an exact expression truthfully I can write the updated mean with this

716
00:37:52,160 --> 00:38:06,579
write the updated mean with this expression expression okay so Sigma P is

717
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:13,940
expression expression okay so Sigma P is what so in so in the filtering

718
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,650
what so in so in the filtering distribution here that the share rights

719
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,440
distribution here that the share rights of Sigma T will be the covariance matrix

720
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,450
of Sigma T will be the covariance matrix okay will be the cabarrus projection I

721
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,279
okay will be the cabarrus projection I am NOT listing what it is alright

722
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:26,269
am NOT listing what it is alright actually because I realized I would

723
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:28,309
actually because I realized I would forgotten index so this should be Sigma

724
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:32,870
forgotten index so this should be Sigma T given they have to pee okay another

725
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,759
T given they have to pee okay another explicitly because doesn't really matter

726
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:37,400
explicitly because doesn't really matter what it is so I am going to take this

727
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,769
what it is so I am going to take this equation that we derived today and I'm

728
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:41,240
equation that we derived today and I'm gonna write it for the update of the

729
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,460
gonna write it for the update of the unknown parameters and this is the form

730
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,730
unknown parameters and this is the form that it takes and I want it to be you

731
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:49,009
that it takes and I want it to be you know twenty details over the symbols

732
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:51,230
know twenty details over the symbols there but on the functional form of this

733
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,539
there but on the functional form of this equation tells me everything that

734
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:59,720
equation tells me everything that somehow you remind it right this

735
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,609
somehow you remind it right this actually when I look at least in the

736
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:03,410
actually when I look at least in the functional integration problem what is

737
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:07,579
functional integration problem what is not see the military we have training

738
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:10,039
not see the military we have training the problem with my table to find the -

739
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:12,529
the problem with my table to find the - Ron so I decided to build up to two

740
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:18,230
Ron so I decided to build up to two minus one and I did you know

741
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:35,750
minus one and I did you know hierarchical if you like every time I

742
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:35,760


743
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:49,350
okay default right this is sort of a standard term when you do supervisor not

744
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,940
standard term when you do supervisor not supervise to everything one data point

745
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,900
supervise to everything one data point at the time

746
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:57,240
at the time it's the drives so this here use the

747
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,770
it's the drives so this here use the previous form a disturbed a thing times

748
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,840
previous form a disturbed a thing times the error that you do other things

749
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,820
the error that you do other things okay now business okay I do know this

750
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,340
okay now business okay I do know this comes in in every quality machine

751
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,200
comes in in every quality machine learning what else what are the

752
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,880
learning what else what are the buzzwords this thing reminds you online

753
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,580
buzzwords this thing reminds you online landing that you should know up and down

754
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,770
landing that you should know up and down because this sort of the standard update

755
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:30,980
because this sort of the standard update formula any names

756
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:30,990


757
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:36,109
most probably it never came in the lecture in this course but in the fall

758
00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:38,109
lecture in this course but in the fall and any other machine learning course

759
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:48,380
and any other machine learning course feedback maybe not what is this equation

760
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,299
feedback maybe not what is this equation looking like does it remind you anything

761
00:40:50,299 --> 00:40:53,770
looking like does it remind you anything at all in the context of anything else

762
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:56,480
at all in the context of anything else come on mr. Nick what is the reminding

763
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:03,840
come on mr. Nick what is the reminding you this

764
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:03,850


765
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:08,320
and and now

766
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:08,330


767
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:16,350
you mean on an end maybe out of them you know wow that's a miracle of nature

768
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:16,360


769
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:21,230
yes

770
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:21,240


771
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,990
you're not implying their organs for no I'll do it

772
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,990
I'll do it yes all right all right thank you

773
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,060
yes all right all right thank you they're not bees going around good okay

774
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,830
they're not bees going around good okay but I'm also surprised that you are

775
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,660
but I'm also surprised that you are thinking of the Robbins Baraka very cool

776
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,300
thinking of the Robbins Baraka very cool and you don't think update or parameters

777
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,810
and you don't think update or parameters that say you have networks or equal else

778
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:42,200
that say you have networks or equal else has this forward anything anyone

779
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,540
has this forward anything anyone algorithm is exactly this for okay

780
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,470
algorithm is exactly this for okay the point here is right when you do this

781
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,420
the point here is right when you do this integration you one pilots a point just

782
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,760
integration you one pilots a point just another parameter you take all the data

783
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,670
another parameter you take all the data you show the Miss quested seven say

784
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,770
you show the Miss quested seven say that's my MA past with et cetera here

785
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,050
that's my MA past with et cetera here will be due by making this problem as

786
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,380
will be due by making this problem as dynamical we compute this online one day

787
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,380
dynamical we compute this online one day the point of the time okay and and we

788
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,030
the point of the time okay and and we start with some parameters and they may

789
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,990
start with some parameters and they may have made them based on this error okay

790
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,910
have made them based on this error okay now usually what you do online learning

791
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:16,700
now usually what you do online learning with problems for algorithm or you know

792
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,460
with problems for algorithm or you know any sort of idea of course to have to

793
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,500
any sort of idea of course to have to grade in this channel usually what you

794
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,170
grade in this channel usually what you have here is some question that is the

795
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,380
have here is some question that is the learning rate for your problem and

796
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,670
learning rate for your problem and usually because of learning later sort

797
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,860
usually because of learning later sort of arbitrarily you have to go three

798
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,480
of arbitrarily you have to go three times two hundred a distress together

799
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,990
times two hundred a distress together mr. Contreras okay now it happens

800
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,630
mr. Contreras okay now it happens because here this comes to be exact

801
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,510
because here this comes to be exact if you destroy the data you get actually

802
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,470
if you destroy the data you get actually the exact estimate

803
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:48,220
the exact estimate for dinner for this problem okay

804
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:48,230


805
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:53,990
paternity but is precise sure if you put the question Croatian for Sigma and

806
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:57,170
the question Croatian for Sigma and Sigma square and you go through another

807
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:59,030
Sigma square and you go through another dataset once then you will converge to

808
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,270
dataset once then you will converge to the exact answer the depending on what

809
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:04,010
the exact answer the depending on what you use for prior it would be either

810
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,130
you use for prior it would be either your Emily or your map estimate so the

811
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,740
your Emily or your map estimate so the point here is right you need to imagine

812
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,920
point here is right you need to imagine three and if you imagine that somehow

813
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,050
three and if you imagine that somehow you can transpose something to a dynamic

814
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,510
you can transpose something to a dynamic problem you get interesting algorithms

815
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:20,230
problem you get interesting algorithms you get an online learning

816
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:24,099
you get an online learning my destination or Emily estimation that

817
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:26,710
my destination or Emily estimation that vision back sort of to stand up ideas of

818
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,870
vision back sort of to stand up ideas of machine learning for the error drives

819
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:33,880
machine learning for the error drives the updates in the parameters now so

820
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,740
the updates in the parameters now so that so this is what I was saying

821
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,570
that so this is what I was saying basically before I put the few stops to

822
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:41,140
basically before I put the few stops to do this with some generic rate that you

823
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,690
do this with some generic rate that you sort of first select with practical

824
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,579
sort of first select with practical training you know justified different

825
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:47,710
training you know justified different values this is what is called the list

826
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:51,760
values this is what is called the list mean squares algorithm all right so this

827
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,560
mean squares algorithm all right so this you have to iterate one should last of

828
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,800
you have to iterate one should last of the data sets to make it to convert the

829
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,050
the data sets to make it to convert the algorithm that I just discussed it's

830
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,839
algorithm that I just discussed it's called the recursively squares algorithm

831
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,880
called the recursively squares algorithm basically converges to the exact

832
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,150
basically converges to the exact solution once you go through all the

833
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:11,500
solution once you go through all the data so this is an interesting thing and

834
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,410
data so this is an interesting thing and by the way if you surf the little

835
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:17,710
by the way if you surf the little children and again because these are the

836
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:20,500
children and again because these are the easy problems so for this lazy problems

837
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,750
easy problems so for this lazy problems you can use these ideas to do some very

838
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:26,470
you can use these ideas to do some very interesting things even you know as I

839
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:29,410
interesting things even you know as I said you can even take deterministic of

840
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,990
said you can even take deterministic of the east and somehow prescribe the

841
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,030
the east and somehow prescribe the problem to dynamical problems and use

842
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,849
problem to dynamical problems and use this ideas to the time integration you

843
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:40,180
this ideas to the time integration you can do whatever you want okay so and

844
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,150
can do whatever you want okay so and again this progress will be derive today

845
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,460
again this progress will be derive today there are analytical for the general

846
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:51,490
there are analytical for the general Gaussian linear dynamical system we

847
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,800
Gaussian linear dynamical system we don't need this okay so this is

848
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,230
don't need this okay so this is basically the desktop folder let's

849
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,849
basically the desktop folder let's actually have a linear regression in one

850
00:44:57,849 --> 00:44:59,859
actually have a linear regression in one dimension right so this is your

851
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:01,599
dimension right so this is your observation model alright

852
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,630
observation model alright the parameters theta basically w0 w1 and

853
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:07,839
the parameters theta basically w0 w1 and so this is Theta and the real thing that

854
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,000
so this is Theta and the real thing that we do is we assume that theta changes

855
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,210
we do is we assume that theta changes with time the time really is not x in

856
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,329
with time the time really is not x in iteration saddam index to allow us to

857
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:18,520
iteration saddam index to allow us to come up with a nice recursive discourse

858
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,910
come up with a nice recursive discourse algorithm ok very nice idea and again

859
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:25,430
algorithm ok very nice idea and again you want to implement this the club's

860
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:27,770
you want to implement this the club's really where it's thin lines right you

861
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:34,430
really where it's thin lines right you can look at it alright and and play with

862
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:41,750
can look at it alright and and play with it as well okay so let me before we go

863
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,130
it as well okay so let me before we go to become a filter can give you some

864
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:47,480
to become a filter can give you some other things that somehow they don't

865
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,330
other things that somehow they don't look like state-space models so for

866
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,520
look like state-space models so for example if you type in the predictions

867
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,730
example if you type in the predictions from the stock price is right so you

868
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:57,440
from the stock price is right so you follow that particular step you know

869
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,290
follow that particular step you know that what the value on Wall Street was

870
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,970
that what the value on Wall Street was every day and you want to do the

871
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,820
every day and you want to do the prediction what the price may be

872
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,490
prediction what the price may be tomorrow based on historical data right

873
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:11,090
tomorrow based on historical data right so you want to find let's say that Y at

874
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:13,640
so you want to find let's say that Y at P plus one if you know the date of time

875
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,950
P plus one if you know the date of time one and P so in this case there's no Z

876
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:18,980
one and P so in this case there's no Z there's no relevant variable so even if

877
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,290
there's no relevant variable so even if you don't have latent variables you can

878
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:23,090
you don't have latent variables you can assume that somehow that they come

879
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:26,359
assume that somehow that they come generated by some stories change the

880
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:29,060
generated by some stories change the variables right but capture the dynamics

881
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,960
variables right but capture the dynamics of the problem but capture this this you

882
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,080
of the problem but capture this this you know the represent accurately this

883
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,609
know the represent accurately this revolution of the observe a shoe that

884
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:39,710
revolution of the observe a shoe that you have but since you don't care about

885
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:42,380
you have but since you don't care about resist is not a big deal because at the

886
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,660
resist is not a big deal because at the end of the day since this models come to

887
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,580
end of the day since this models come to the GAO severe models you can integrate

888
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,730
the GAO severe models you can integrate Z out completely so this can lead to

889
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:53,599
Z out completely so this can lead to famously there so Z is used because it

890
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,490
famously there so Z is used because it can give this sort of community

891
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:58,849
can give this sort of community relations in my wires right that there

892
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:02,359
relations in my wires right that there long or short-range as I desire right

893
00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:04,640
long or short-range as I desire right but since I'm only interesting why I

894
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,070
but since I'm only interesting why I think just where to make this prediction

895
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,410
think just where to make this prediction to predict this I can integrate wise

896
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:14,590
to predict this I can integrate wise this out so years you may not even exist

897
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:18,380
this out so years you may not even exist but in traditional in your model may

898
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,450
but in traditional in your model may assist you actually to get this

899
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:23,570
assist you actually to get this distribution alright so don't have

900
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,700
distribution alright so don't have something that says well but I have any

901
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,800
something that says well but I have any latent variables not something you to

902
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,180
latent variables not something you to make them late environments because how

903
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,130
make them late environments because how you represent the dynamics in a good way

904
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,440
you represent the dynamics in a good way to represent the dynamics you system is

905
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,350
to represent the dynamics you system is with one or two or multiple chains of

906
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:40,860
with one or two or multiple chains of latent variables so consider that to be

907
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,290
latent variables so consider that to be an approach so let me give you some

908
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:51,990
an approach so let me give you some simple models so so the observation

909
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:56,790
simple models so so the observation models is this local level available to

910
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:00,600
models is this local level available to sit here and what you do is introduce

911
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,910
sit here and what you do is introduce some dynamics on this local level okay

912
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:05,850
some dynamics on this local level okay so Y is equal 80 plus some Gaussian

913
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:09,090
so Y is equal 80 plus some Gaussian noise an eighty eighty minus one person

914
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:11,820
noise an eighty eighty minus one person of the Gaussian noise okay so the

915
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,860
of the Gaussian noise okay so the probability graphical model for this is

916
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,890
probability graphical model for this is basically Y depends only on eighty but

917
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,510
basically Y depends only on eighty but you're saying some dynamics from eighty

918
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:21,120
you're saying some dynamics from eighty that in this case they are Markovian so

919
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:26,190
that in this case they are Markovian so eighty depends only on 80 minus one okay

920
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:29,310
eighty depends only on 80 minus one okay so if you can actually what interesting

921
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:31,020
so if you can actually what interesting data you can generate with this right

922
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,390
data you can generate with this right and why beside this are very powerful

923
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:38,670
and why beside this are very powerful when you play with with data so from

924
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:41,010
when you play with with data so from this level model that you see here you

925
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:42,810
this level model that you see here you can actually try completely different

926
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:45,930
can actually try completely different scenarios you can have a system where as

927
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:48,540
scenarios you can have a system where as noisy observations but as deterministic

928
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,820
noisy observations but as deterministic dynamics you can take a system where as

929
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,890
dynamics you can take a system where as noisy dynamics but the domestic

930
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,720
noisy dynamics but the domestic observations and then you can make

931
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,850
observations and then you can make everything noisy and you can speak out

932
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,500
everything noisy and you can speak out by playing a little bit with the

933
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,230
by playing a little bit with the parameters the results can be live day

934
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,960
parameters the results can be live day and night

935
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:09,360
and night okay if you can write I mean you can

936
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,590
okay if you can write I mean you can this code again is a few lines to do

937
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:15,900
this code again is a few lines to do this predictions so this is you know

938
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,790
this predictions so this is you know something that you will use in

939
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,320
something that you will use in econometrics

940
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,900
econometrics you know predicting earthquakes so I can

941
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,900
you know predicting earthquakes so I can sound like civil engineer right and

942
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,580
sound like civil engineer right and things like that

943
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,730
things like that now during the wind speed right now must

944
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:37,470
now during the wind speed right now must be relevant as well okay all right

945
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:41,710
be relevant as well okay all right and so canister sort of any bit more

946
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:44,770
and so canister sort of any bit more complicated graphical mode them who are

947
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:47,980
complicated graphical mode them who are the observations why depend on this

948
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,580
the observations why depend on this local level a but this local level a

949
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,650
local level a but this local level a depends on the B that has its own

950
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:56,230
depends on the B that has its own dynamics okay and if you do actually

951
00:49:56,230 --> 00:50:01,330
dynamics okay and if you do actually exist you can control even the sphere if

952
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:05,350
exist you can control even the sphere if you like in in your observations so for

953
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,930
you like in in your observations so for example if you if you take think of this

954
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,030
example if you if you take think of this model as it is now right and take that

955
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,820
model as it is now right and take that this no bumping dynamics here so BT

956
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:16,810
this no bumping dynamics here so BT minus 1 equal to BT so every time you

957
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,940
minus 1 equal to BT so every time you calculate they take you getting

958
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,030
calculate they take you getting accustomed amount of me

959
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:23,920
accustomed amount of me Chalmers you have be attempted to be

960
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,070
Chalmers you have be attempted to be before big so this B is going to come to

961
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:30,160
before big so this B is going to come to be is part of the train if you have in

962
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,710
be is part of the train if you have in the evolution of the observations so we

963
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,720
the evolution of the observations so we have sort of some linear trend plus

964
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,480
have sort of some linear trend plus noise around it okay so this can allows

965
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,940
noise around it okay so this can allows you to very easily to actually more than

966
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,830
you to very easily to actually more than you know where the behaviors you like of

967
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:47,560
you know where the behaviors you like of dynamical data and you see here the gang

968
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,410
dynamical data and you see here the gang the three cases where you play as to

969
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,380
the three cases where you play as to what is the deterministic noise obscures

970
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:57,640
what is the deterministic noise obscures observations the system or more okay all

971
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,910
observations the system or more okay all right so let me I'm going to finish

972
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:03,700
right so let me I'm going to finish because this is the most important

973
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,130
because this is the most important problem that in the context of

974
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,080
problem that in the context of statistical machine learning modeling

975
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,420
statistical machine learning modeling but also it comes a require in physics

976
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,520
but also it comes a require in physics this is what's called the album of them

977
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,500
this is what's called the album of them the auto regressive autoregressive

978
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,140
the auto regressive autoregressive moving average model you may have seen

979
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:23,940
moving average model you may have seen it in different contexts so the

980
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,370
it in different contexts so the excellent thing okay there's not here

981
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:29,470
excellent thing okay there's not here observations on Z right I'm just writing

982
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:31,750
observations on Z right I'm just writing this model like that and it's happy

983
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,640
this model like that and it's happy to interpret it as to what is the state

984
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,620
to interpret it as to what is the state what you observe and things like that so

985
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:41,320
what you observe and things like that so actually here depends on this P previous

986
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:45,760
actually here depends on this P previous values of X T XT minus 1 to X 3 minus P

987
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,030
values of X T XT minus 1 to X 3 minus P but also depends on this parameters W

988
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:51,070
but also depends on this parameters W but you can tell them as T the very most

989
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:55,300
but you can tell them as T the very most so from 1 to Q and the question this

990
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,800
so from 1 to Q and the question this think you can model this modeling

991
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,540
think you can model this modeling because you try to shape it can tell how

992
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,930
because you try to shape it can tell how the exes correlate you know in firing

993
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:10,450
the exes correlate you know in firing the tree we have short life correlations

994
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,460
the tree we have short life correlations you know we have long term correlations

995
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,190
you know we have long term correlations we have mode and so this all about

996
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:16,780
we have mode and so this all about the shorter regressive moving average

997
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:20,830
the shorter regressive moving average model allows you to do that so for

998
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:24,610
model allows you to do that so for example I'm taking the case here when T

999
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:26,590
example I'm taking the case here when T is equal to 0 so this term is not there

1000
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:29,290
is equal to 0 so this term is not there and take a proven case should be equal

1001
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,720
and take a proven case should be equal to 1 immediately you can see that this

1002
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,990
to 1 immediately you can see that this is the population model one so for

1003
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,810
is the population model one so for treatment one is your first municipal

1004
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:40,270
treatment one is your first municipal chain right so one of the things we

1005
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:43,150
chain right so one of the things we learned about Markov chains few weeks

1006
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:45,220
learned about Markov chains few weeks ago basically you can model them to

1007
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,030
ago basically you can model them to dissolve about you now if you take the P

1008
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:51,220
dissolve about you now if you take the P to be equal to you know this time not to

1009
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,410
to be equal to you know this time not to be there and you only have this Q

1010
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:56,260
be there and you only have this Q they're basically the dependencies for Q

1011
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,130
they're basically the dependencies for Q equal to 1

1012
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:01,180
equal to 1 they look like that alright so somehow

1013
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,150
they look like that alright so somehow now if you introduce collisions between

1014
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:08,800
now if you introduce collisions between the axis because they come from the

1015
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,850
the axis because they come from the spinal cord which 1xq depend on W 1 X 2

1016
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,800
spinal cord which 1xq depend on W 1 X 2 X 3 for gamma D 2 so here we have

1017
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,310
X 3 for gamma D 2 so here we have short-range correlations okay so and

1018
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:21,970
short-range correlations okay so and again this is only for Q equal to 1 and

1019
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:24,190
again this is only for Q equal to 1 and if you just critical to 1 and P 1 to 1

1020
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:26,260
if you just critical to 1 and P 1 to 1 you can get the provide least graphical

1021
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,690
you can get the provide least graphical models looks like this so it becomes

1022
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:31,780
models looks like this so it becomes basically correlations in time that are

1023
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:35,320
basically correlations in time that are both both

1024
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:35,330


1025
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:39,250
for example you can see here from my ex - depends on X 1 but then should you

1026
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,760
- depends on X 1 but then should you know that this connection is between W

1027
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,800
know that this connection is between W but you get extra sugar for natural

1028
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,000
but you get extra sugar for natural correlation on on this model this is a

1029
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,380
correlation on on this model this is a huge huge area for attempt if you if

1030
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,850
huge huge area for attempt if you if your work has anything to do with

1031
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:59,590
your work has anything to do with dynamic data then this is a subject area

1032
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:02,530
dynamic data then this is a subject area on its own people do PhD theses actually

1033
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,770
on its own people do PhD theses actually on this on this topic okay so don't

1034
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:08,290
on this on this topic okay so don't consider central quad because this looks

1035
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,960
consider central quad because this looks simple are only for a lecture all right

1036
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,670
simple are only for a lecture all right simple things you know what it means

1037
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:15,310
simple things you know what it means there are clickable everywhere and if

1038
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:17,050
there are clickable everywhere and if there are people everywhere there are

1039
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:19,960
there are people everywhere there are impact is enormous and everybody cares

1040
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:26,830
impact is enormous and everybody cares about what you do okay if you have any

1041
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,680
about what you do okay if you have any on the wings you know with engineering

1042
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,040
on the wings you know with engineering then basically as they say as the strong

1043
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,280
then basically as they say as the strong choice is going to the wind right ok so

1044
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,040
choice is going to the wind right ok so here it is it's a little bit more

1045
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:39,910
here it is it's a little bit more complicated than that

1046
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:45,700
complicated than that ok so let's say we have 23 minutes so we

1047
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:50,530
ok so let's say we have 23 minutes so we have about 20 minutes to you I will need

1048
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,780
have about 20 minutes to you I will need to cover the Kalman filtering because

1049
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:55,450
to cover the Kalman filtering because sort of a little part of the course but

1050
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:57,850
sort of a little part of the course but you need basically to see the equation

1051
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:02,290
you need basically to see the equation and then convince you in the next

1052
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:03,610
and then convince you in the next lecture that you can actually get the

1053
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:08,350
lecture that you can actually get the same equations with with you know

1054
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:15,130
same equations with with you know master's passing in in gloves okay we

1055
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:16,630
master's passing in in gloves okay we want to complete the filtering

1056
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:20,230
want to complete the filtering distribution of Z T the posted of city

1057
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:23,470
distribution of Z T the posted of city given by date of the time T and giving

1058
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:27,370
given by date of the time T and giving this incubator here from entity ok so my

1059
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,560
this incubator here from entity ok so my invitation that I'm going to use see

1060
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:33,370
invitation that I'm going to use see there's no reason to put mu T plus T

1061
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:35,920
there's no reason to put mu T plus T because everything is P so we have two

1062
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,750
because everything is P so we have two subscripts that they are the same I am

1063
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:38,309
subscripts that they are the same I am use

1064
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:40,920
use basically this nuclear Sigma T I want

1065
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,949
basically this nuclear Sigma T I want you to remember the notation because the

1066
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:45,449
you to remember the notation because the questions when you may get a little bit

1067
00:55:45,449 --> 00:55:48,029
questions when you may get a little bit more complicated okay so remember the

1068
00:55:48,029 --> 00:55:50,279
more complicated okay so remember the notation we use what meaty and Sigma

1069
00:55:50,279 --> 00:55:53,279
notation we use what meaty and Sigma theories is for this filtering

1070
00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:54,900
theories is for this filtering distribution this procedure of simply

1071
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:09,150
distribution this procedure of simply given my observations okay invents a

1072
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:11,339
given my observations okay invents a bunch of very fundamental equations but

1073
00:56:11,339 --> 00:56:14,219
bunch of very fundamental equations but maybe you guys have loved chain the

1074
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:16,799
maybe you guys have loved chain the fears are semester vampire of using this

1075
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,079
fears are semester vampire of using this equations they thought that was news to

1076
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:22,289
equations they thought that was news to them but this is the questions that have

1077
00:56:22,289 --> 00:56:23,939
them but this is the questions that have nothing Lewis statistics if you do

1078
00:56:23,939 --> 00:56:25,979
nothing Lewis statistics if you do machine learning this equations come

1079
00:56:25,979 --> 00:56:29,999
machine learning this equations come everywhere so there are those equations

1080
00:56:29,999 --> 00:56:32,880
everywhere so there are those equations for if you have an a Gaussian in effect

1081
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,670
for if you have an a Gaussian in effect with this meaner variance and you have

1082
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:37,650
with this meaner variance and you have another condition and a variance of Y

1083
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:40,079
another condition and a variance of Y given X which is there's a mean that is

1084
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,539
given X which is there's a mean that is linear in X right this is what we call a

1085
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:45,180
linear in X right this is what we call a linear value model then you can actually

1086
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:48,359
linear value model then you can actually use business rule to invert this and

1087
00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:50,789
use business rule to invert this and from the probability of Y given X and P

1088
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:52,349
from the probability of Y given X and P of X you can get the probability of x

1089
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:59,670
of X you can get the probability of x given Y and the purpose in Bishop is a

1090
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:02,489
given Y and the purpose in Bishop is a nice blue you know and - first semester

1091
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:07,769
nice blue you know and - first semester you can visit them in learning on their

1092
00:57:07,769 --> 00:57:09,900
you can visit them in learning on their first software or second there's miss

1093
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:13,309
first software or second there's miss equations ok so if you want to compute

1094
00:57:13,309 --> 00:57:16,499
equations ok so if you want to compute from big defects given Y you basically

1095
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:18,180
from big defects given Y you basically have to comb the journey from this to

1096
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:21,059
have to comb the journey from this to okay and then from the joint basically

1097
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:23,069
okay and then from the joint basically go back and find the posterior of x

1098
00:57:23,069 --> 00:57:26,099
go back and find the posterior of x given one okay so it comes to be like

1099
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:29,039
given one okay so it comes to be like this alright so I'm going to move this

1100
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:32,609
this alright so I'm going to move this equations about 10 times today a notion

1101
00:57:32,609 --> 00:57:34,949
equations about 10 times today a notion that if you can do mister if you

1102
00:57:34,949 --> 00:57:36,689
that if you can do mister if you multiply them and you form the joint

1103
00:57:36,689 --> 00:57:39,329
multiply them and you form the joint affection Y actually what you can do if

1104
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:43,769
affection Y actually what you can do if you can integrate X out and basically

1105
00:57:43,769 --> 00:57:44,569
you can integrate X out and basically close

1106
00:57:44,569 --> 00:57:46,459
close and come up with their Gaussian

1107
00:57:46,459 --> 00:57:49,249
and come up with their Gaussian distribution describe B of Y 7,000 the

1108
00:57:49,249 --> 00:57:51,319
distribution describe B of Y 7,000 the tradition is actually given by this nice

1109
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:55,910
tradition is actually given by this nice simple for group so when you piay with

1110
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:58,519
simple for group so when you piay with dodgems look at the problem is a

1111
00:57:58,519 --> 00:57:59,900
dodgems look at the problem is a Gaussian lineal if you have something

1112
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,089
Gaussian lineal if you have something that the mean is to their function

1113
00:58:02,089 --> 00:58:04,910
that the mean is to their function affection and the the distribution of X

1114
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:06,469
affection and the the distribution of X is down shell then if you know

1115
00:58:06,469 --> 00:58:08,209
is down shell then if you know everything else this Gaussian and this

1116
00:58:08,209 --> 00:58:10,069
everything else this Gaussian and this time the formulas that can take you from

1117
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:13,759
time the formulas that can take you from X from Y given X D X given Y and it can

1118
00:58:13,759 --> 00:58:16,910
X from Y given X D X given Y and it can take you from P of X to P of what all

1119
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,400
take you from P of X to P of what all right so this progress I'm going to use

1120
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,669
right so this progress I'm going to use this extensively and the next time

1121
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:27,019
this extensively and the next time longer uses something if we have used it

1122
00:58:27,019 --> 00:58:29,779
longer uses something if we have used it the infinitely time chance declines in

1123
00:58:29,779 --> 00:58:31,699
the infinitely time chance declines in machine learning every time you have to

1124
00:58:31,699 --> 00:58:35,120
machine learning every time you have to invert big matrices you need to think if

1125
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,009
invert big matrices you need to think if there is some sort of factorization or a

1126
00:58:37,009 --> 00:58:39,769
there is some sort of factorization or a way to rewrite the matricis in this form

1127
00:58:39,769 --> 00:58:41,959
way to rewrite the matricis in this form so you can use what's called the Woodman

1128
00:58:41,959 --> 00:58:45,589
so you can use what's called the Woodman edema or this metric Sebastian Lima okay

1129
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:48,380
edema or this metric Sebastian Lima okay and I am NOT gonna go the details but

1130
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:51,859
and I am NOT gonna go the details but here you notice this inverse matrix can

1131
00:58:51,859 --> 00:58:54,309
here you notice this inverse matrix can be written as like that so if it happens

1132
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:59,329
be written as like that so if it happens the best B matrix if this matrix here is

1133
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:03,410
the best B matrix if this matrix here is M by M where m is much less than this n

1134
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:06,099
M by M where m is much less than this n by n matrix obviously this pays off

1135
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:08,359
by n matrix obviously this pays off computationally and in lots of times you

1136
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:10,549
computationally and in lots of times you don't see this result but if you try to

1137
00:59:10,549 --> 00:59:12,949
don't see this result but if you try to do it's a Gaussian processes you will

1138
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:14,449
do it's a Gaussian processes you will immediately even if you don't use this

1139
00:59:14,449 --> 00:59:16,459
immediately even if you don't use this you'll be investing a million by million

1140
00:59:16,459 --> 00:59:21,589
you'll be investing a million by million matrices rather 100 by 100 okay so the

1141
00:59:21,589 --> 00:59:23,569
matrices rather 100 by 100 okay so the whole Ummah

1142
00:59:23,569 --> 00:59:26,449
whole Ummah it is always there so when it's

1143
00:59:26,449 --> 00:59:28,160
it is always there so when it's something like that it screams at you

1144
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,589
something like that it screams at you and says you sleep okay matrix inversion

1145
00:59:30,589 --> 00:59:39,349
and says you sleep okay matrix inversion lemma okay to complete these filtering

1146
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:41,049
lemma okay to complete these filtering distribution

1147
00:59:41,049 --> 00:59:43,239
distribution it's easy in a sense that we have to be

1148
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:45,370
it's easy in a sense that we have to be exactly the same identical steps we did

1149
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:48,069
exactly the same identical steps we did with it for the filter and distribution

1150
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:50,620
with it for the filter and distribution for the hidden Markov model so you

1151
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,659
for the hidden Markov model so you remember a hidden Markov model to get

1152
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:54,519
remember a hidden Markov model to get the content distribution first things we

1153
00:59:54,519 --> 00:59:57,759
the content distribution first things we have to do is to get the one-step

1154
00:59:57,759 --> 01:00:00,699
have to do is to get the one-step percent prediction for Z all right so

1155
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:03,549
percent prediction for Z all right so given back up to time t minus 1 all

1156
01:00:03,549 --> 01:00:05,380
given back up to time t minus 1 all right the first time

1157
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:07,239
right the first time we will use the product we will compute

1158
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:10,479
we will use the product we will compute the predicted distribution of Z T and

1159
01:00:10,479 --> 01:00:13,989
the predicted distribution of Z T and here notice but I know here's you from

1160
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:16,029
here notice but I know here's you from one to three minus one because one of

1161
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,669
one to three minus one because one of the prediction of the complexity I'm

1162
01:00:18,669 --> 01:00:20,589
the prediction of the complexity I'm going to use the input that I have which

1163
01:00:20,589 --> 01:00:24,519
going to use the input that I have which goes to want to t just given it's not

1164
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:26,709
goes to want to t just given it's not the forcing term okay it's the next

1165
01:00:26,709 --> 01:00:28,569
the forcing term okay it's the next we're talking about using the odds of

1166
01:00:28,569 --> 01:00:31,209
we're talking about using the odds of catching time so we know if you

1167
01:00:31,209 --> 01:00:33,669
catching time so we know if you obviously we're going to use it so the

1168
01:00:33,669 --> 01:00:36,069
obviously we're going to use it so the derivation of you see here it's exactly

1169
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:37,929
derivation of you see here it's exactly the same as for hidden Markov models

1170
01:00:37,929 --> 01:00:40,329
the same as for hidden Markov models effectively what has happen is you can

1171
01:00:40,329 --> 01:00:42,939
effectively what has happen is you can paint your plug in here is a 2-1 and

1172
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:46,269
paint your plug in here is a 2-1 and then we integrate in ZT minus 1 and then

1173
01:00:46,269 --> 01:00:48,189
then we integrate in ZT minus 1 and then what you do is you use Vegas rule to

1174
01:00:48,189 --> 01:00:51,759
what you do is you use Vegas rule to write this as this probability times

1175
01:00:51,759 --> 01:00:55,059
write this as this probability times this probability and this is easy

1176
01:00:55,059 --> 01:00:57,789
this probability and this is easy because this Michele you know what the

1177
01:00:57,789 --> 01:01:03,759
because this Michele you know what the test this is not the right what is this

1178
01:01:03,759 --> 01:01:06,219
test this is not the right what is this distribution it's immersion defined by

1179
01:01:06,219 --> 01:01:11,529
distribution it's immersion defined by this rayon demon and what is this this

1180
01:01:11,529 --> 01:01:13,329
this rayon demon and what is this this is the probability of this type of t

1181
01:01:13,329 --> 01:01:15,429
is the probability of this type of t minus 1 given the date of the t minus 1

1182
01:01:15,429 --> 01:01:18,729
minus 1 given the date of the t minus 1 i actually don't make the youthful 1/2

1183
01:01:18,729 --> 01:01:20,859
i actually don't make the youthful 1/2 thing because i'm retired he of the t

1184
01:01:20,859 --> 01:01:23,019
thing because i'm retired he of the t minus 1 so this would be u 1 t minus 1

1185
01:01:23,019 --> 01:01:27,429
minus 1 so this would be u 1 t minus 1 really so and remember we said we're

1186
01:01:27,429 --> 01:01:30,039
really so and remember we said we're gonna guess we are going to denote the

1187
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:34,059
gonna guess we are going to denote the mean and the variance with the subscript

1188
01:01:34,059 --> 01:01:36,609
mean and the variance with the subscript 1 subscript only so this are the mean

1189
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:39,309
1 subscript only so this are the mean and the variance at time t minus 12 so

1190
01:01:39,309 --> 01:01:41,019
and the variance at time t minus 12 so recursively and we'll assume that I know

1191
01:01:41,019 --> 01:01:42,460
recursively and we'll assume that I know this distribution

1192
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:45,220
this distribution and I'm going to try to get adventure

1193
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:48,520
and I'm going to try to get adventure this is what we try to get right we try

1194
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:52,930
this is what we try to get right we try to the first write this our notation so

1195
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:55,270
to the first write this our notation so obviously of list would be at this

1196
01:01:55,270 --> 01:02:02,800
obviously of list would be at this distribution yes recursively question

1197
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,990
distribution yes recursively question you know this and then we will complete

1198
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:06,400
you know this and then we will complete this distribution and using this

1199
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,650
this distribution and using this distribution we would try to find that

1200
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,569
distribution we would try to find that the Philippine distribution city given

1201
01:02:10,569 --> 01:02:15,700
the Philippine distribution city given data from 150 as a second step the

1202
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,500
data from 150 as a second step the equations don't mean anything unless you

1203
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:21,579
equations don't mean anything unless you have a sense when they come and and how

1204
01:02:21,579 --> 01:02:23,620
have a sense when they come and and how you actually do the algebra so if you

1205
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,900
you actually do the algebra so if you look at equations algebra it's an

1206
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,059
look at equations algebra it's an important but it's important to know

1207
01:02:28,059 --> 01:02:31,660
important but it's important to know yeah I can do this because it reminds me

1208
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:34,480
yeah I can do this because it reminds me this problem so look at this now we want

1209
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,109
this problem so look at this now we want to integrate in three my ZT minus 1 of

1210
01:02:38,109 --> 01:02:42,190
to integrate in three my ZT minus 1 of something a distribution of CP that has

1211
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:44,200
something a distribution of CP that has remained that is a linear function of z

1212
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:48,400
remained that is a linear function of z t minus 1 last emergency p minus 1 and

1213
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,230
t minus 1 last emergency p minus 1 and we need to dominate to complete the

1214
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:51,579
we need to dominate to complete the management of the business within

1215
01:02:51,579 --> 01:02:54,309
management of the business within various state city does not remind a

1216
01:02:54,309 --> 01:02:59,260
various state city does not remind a formula does this is my very founder

1217
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:04,359
formula does this is my very founder whatever the linear browser more than

1218
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:07,569
whatever the linear browser more than invest is functional you know prior VFX

1219
01:03:07,569 --> 01:03:14,430
invest is functional you know prior VFX and we need to compute the modulo

1220
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:14,440


1221
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:20,210
right this princess just me you know now idiot leg day you know

1222
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:23,520
idiot leg day you know this is Italian okay you can look

1223
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,770
this is Italian okay you can look at the previous 12 us two slides ago and

1224
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:27,779
at the previous 12 us two slides ago and you said you know rap business leaders

1225
01:03:27,779 --> 01:03:30,210
you said you know rap business leaders sure we have visit me I'm just popping

1226
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:33,870
sure we have visit me I'm just popping the formulas chambers members based

1227
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:36,120
the formulas chambers members based listening a metric Susanna there's a big

1228
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,880
listening a metric Susanna there's a big layer of this me - wanna stick with it -

1229
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,079
layer of this me - wanna stick with it - no so this is the answer and I of the

1230
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:45,390
no so this is the answer and I of the variance here between this is to remind

1231
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:48,240
variance here between this is to remind me the wristlet predictable time T but I

1232
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:52,230
me the wristlet predictable time T but I only have date up to P minus one deliver

1233
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:54,480
only have date up to P minus one deliver we don't here is between this is if what

1234
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,970
we don't here is between this is if what times are the staying basically okay but

1235
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:58,710
times are the staying basically okay but here this is the predictive distribution

1236
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:01,500
here this is the predictive distribution having data t minus 12 and this is the

1237
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,500
having data t minus 12 and this is the predict you'll time take again have been

1238
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,390
predict you'll time take again have been nothing but copy the formulas for

1239
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:10,109
nothing but copy the formulas for minions systems but I saw you before so

1240
01:04:10,109 --> 01:04:14,130
minions systems but I saw you before so this one step ahead prediction of Z T

1241
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:15,960
this one step ahead prediction of Z T given my data BT minus 1 is a Gaussian

1242
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,430
given my data BT minus 1 is a Gaussian with this mean of the variance

1243
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:20,730
with this mean of the variance nicely so how do we compute now the

1244
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:23,160
nicely so how do we compute now the probability how do we compute actually

1245
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,010
probability how do we compute actually the filtering distribution which if I

1246
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:29,400
the filtering distribution which if I have data from 1 to T how do i compute

1247
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,240
have data from 1 to T how do i compute the posterior of CP this cable is rule

1248
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:37,710
the posterior of CP this cable is rule ok so I split my evidence from 1 to t 2

1249
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:40,710
ok so I split my evidence from 1 to t 2 evidence from 1 to t minus 1 and I put

1250
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,599
evidence from 1 to t minus 1 and I put like this separately and then I like

1251
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:46,549
like this separately and then I like this proportional that the you know the

1252
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,390
this proportional that the you know the denominator is unimportant

1253
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:51,510
denominator is unimportant I like this as Y P given C T so that's

1254
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:54,029
I like this as Y P given C T so that's my observation love them and what

1255
01:04:54,029 --> 01:04:56,519
my observation love them and what distribution is this it's a garden that

1256
01:04:56,519 --> 01:04:59,970
distribution is this it's a garden that has a mean mu theta minus R and a

1257
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:03,210
has a mean mu theta minus R and a variance Sigma T females for now I am

1258
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:03,970
variance Sigma T females for now I am looking at

1259
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:06,340
looking at them and without showing to their

1260
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:08,770
them and without showing to their questions can you tell me if you can

1261
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:10,480
questions can you tell me if you can actually compute analytically now this

1262
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,060
actually compute analytically now this product and why based on this linear

1263
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:17,740
product and why based on this linear guys are models in other ways if I go

1264
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:19,900
guys are models in other ways if I go back to three slides can you tell me

1265
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:22,120
back to three slides can you tell me what is their demeanor says yes I can do

1266
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,970
what is their demeanor says yes I can do this so can you tell me what is this

1267
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:26,590
this so can you tell me what is this distribution of light the given state

1268
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:32,380
distribution of light the given state they give us some symbols I mean what is

1269
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:35,830
they give us some symbols I mean what is very clear is a function of city from

1270
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:38,920
very clear is a function of city from our browser linear model for a system of

1271
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,810
our browser linear model for a system of the first line is the metrics say let's

1272
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:48,730
the first line is the metrics say let's say 50 times the city plus B times u T

1273
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:50,980
say 50 times the city plus B times u T which we don't care plus notice the

1274
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:55,510
which we don't care plus notice the Guardian notes so this distribution is I

1275
01:05:55,510 --> 01:06:00,340
Guardian notes so this distribution is I mean we basically this may be here all

1276
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:03,190
mean we basically this may be here all right is a Gaussian okay and we know

1277
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:05,550
right is a Gaussian okay and we know exactly what the main work the variances

1278
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:07,090
exactly what the main work the variances everything okay

1279
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:10,960
everything okay kind of this this distribution can you

1280
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,440
kind of this this distribution can you tell me what you know what can you tell

1281
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:18,460
tell me what you know what can you tell me about this distribution

1282
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:18,470


1283
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:24,520
no it's good all right so there's miss the dish especially another Gulf Stream

1284
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:28,690
the dish especially another Gulf Stream okay so let me just write them love okay

1285
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:31,480
okay so let me just write them love okay so this we know this we computed on the

1286
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,630
so this we know this we computed on the previous slide and so basically what you

1287
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:39,700
previous slide and so basically what you have this if you have a custom solution

1288
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:42,069
have this if you have a custom solution to this problem that is a little bit

1289
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:44,050
to this problem that is a little bit complicated all right so I'm going to

1290
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:45,309
complicated all right so I'm going to show you a quarter the algebra count

1291
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:50,079
show you a quarter the algebra count okay and so this distribution has this

1292
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,990
okay and so this distribution has this mean and this covariance matrix so the

1293
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:56,050
mean and this covariance matrix so the mean is basically the mean of this

1294
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:59,050
mean is basically the mean of this distribution all right because this

1295
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:01,329
distribution all right because this metric scary but you will see explicit

1296
01:07:01,329 --> 01:07:04,180
metric scary but you will see explicit in a second time some residual are okay

1297
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,730
in a second time some residual are okay and the Sigma T is the gain defined

1298
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:09,400
and the Sigma T is the gain defined through this gain matrix K times this

1299
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:15,930
through this gain matrix K times this matrix that comes here Sigma T 2 minus 1

1300
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:15,940


1301
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:21,339
so this matrix again you will see one fly this motivation by the way is not

1302
01:07:21,339 --> 01:07:22,030
fly this motivation by the way is not too severe

1303
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:25,030
too severe all right this product okay it takes

1304
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:26,530
all right this product okay it takes some algebra

1305
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:29,530
some algebra ok you factor you have the product of

1306
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:31,030
ok you factor you have the product of two bonds and so we're gonna have to see

1307
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:33,790
two bonds and so we're gonna have to see how this calculation works some runner

1308
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:35,980
how this calculation works some runner before I give you the reversal have to

1309
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:40,780
before I give you the reversal have to give you all the symbols this current

1310
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:44,760
give you all the symbols this current gain gain matrix is given basically by

1311
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,859
gain gain matrix is given basically by the providers that we computed on the

1312
01:07:47,859 --> 01:07:49,059
the providers that we computed on the one stamp that had predicted

1313
01:07:49,059 --> 01:07:51,700
one stamp that had predicted distribution times C transpose times

1314
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,550
distribution times C transpose times this matrix s inverse and this matrix

1315
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:57,010
this matrix s inverse and this matrix has seen versed discuss the scale what

1316
01:07:57,010 --> 01:08:00,400
has seen versed discuss the scale what this is given by an analytical

1317
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,040
this is given by an analytical expression all right you know the stree

1318
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,050
expression all right you know the stree matrix this again comes from the

1319
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:08,710
matrix this again comes from the variance of the of the Z given the date

1320
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,930
variance of the of the Z given the date of the t minus 1 and this is the noise

1321
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:15,220
of the t minus 1 and this is the noise in the observation model so everything

1322
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:17,079
in the observation model so everything is known right if this calculation if

1323
01:08:17,079 --> 01:08:19,870
is known right if this calculation if this formulas make any sense what we

1324
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:21,910
this formulas make any sense what we need to best take

1325
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:24,730
need to best take the mean from the one step ahead

1326
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:27,190
the mean from the one step ahead predictive distribution and corrective

1327
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:30,420
predictive distribution and corrective using this residual are all right

1328
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:33,820
using this residual are all right multiplied with Kalman gain metrics and

1329
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:37,120
multiplied with Kalman gain metrics and the residual are is basically the

1330
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,050
the residual are is basically the observation of time t minus this entity

1331
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:48,520
observation of time t minus this entity here and so what is this this is the

1332
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:53,690
here and so what is this this is the mean of what

1333
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:53,700


1334
01:08:53,700 --> 01:09:00,570
a competitive we completely lose that I had predicted distribution sheep a given

1335
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:03,120
had predicted distribution sheep a given day the right to t minus 1 this is not

1336
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,099
day the right to t minus 1 this is not the same this is the predicted

1337
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,920
the same this is the predicted distribution of the observe Asian given

1338
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,950
distribution of the observe Asian given data 1 to P minus 1 but that's an easy

1339
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:15,800
data 1 to P minus 1 but that's an easy distribution because YT is 3 times Z P

1340
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:25,999
distribution because YT is 3 times Z P plus the input plus some noise of the

1341
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:30,450
plus the input plus some noise of the distribution which is worse because DT

1342
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:34,710
distribution which is worse because DT times DT I'm not giving any variation of

1343
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:36,059
times DT I'm not giving any variation of this product right

1344
01:09:36,059 --> 01:09:39,329
this product right anything on 13 years he told me in a

1345
01:09:39,329 --> 01:09:42,749
anything on 13 years he told me in a distribution which is nice on city and

1346
01:09:42,749 --> 01:09:46,140
distribution which is nice on city and I'm sure he you know eclairisse 2000 and

1347
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:54,890
I'm sure he you know eclairisse 2000 and this is also not the middle city now

1348
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:54,900


1349
01:09:54,900 --> 01:10:01,050
right so this is a linger in modern city like this is you know so thousand times

1350
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:03,450
like this is you know so thousand times a Gaussian and somehow is a miracle of

1351
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:06,030
a Gaussian and somehow is a miracle of manipulations we should be using the

1352
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:08,730
manipulations we should be using the identities that I gave you we get this

1353
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:10,830
identities that I gave you we get this nice results okay so the question is

1354
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:18,820
nice results okay so the question is where do we get this result

1355
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:18,830


1356
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:27,750
let me put everything here so perfect I get this result

1357
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:27,760


1358
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:33,900
I needed an 808 the fabulous with an innovation system to give you a piece of

1359
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,900
innovation system to give you a piece of this camera filtering updates from the

1360
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,120
this camera filtering updates from the predictive distribution where do we get

1361
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:50,370
predictive distribution where do we get this result

1362
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:50,380


1363
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:58,500
so she would I have this white they given City right can you tell me is his

1364
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,830
given City right can you tell me is his church a Gaussian is the limit of

1365
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:09,510
church a Gaussian is the limit of Gaussian linear density so this Agartha

1366
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:11,520
Gaussian linear density so this Agartha right is the mean of the Gaussian and in

1367
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:16,500
right is the mean of the Gaussian and in a function of Z T the middle area system

1368
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,890
a function of Z T the middle area system that equals two times 3t plus lane to

1369
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:22,980
that equals two times 3t plus lane to pass the lowest all right so yes there

1370
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:25,110
pass the lowest all right so yes there is a symmetric there so this is a

1371
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,800
is a symmetric there so this is a Gaussian that doesn't mean three times

1372
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:33,210
Gaussian that doesn't mean three times the Z plane is going to pass the

1373
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:35,700
the Z plane is going to pass the Gaussian noise okay so basically what

1374
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,130
Gaussian noise okay so basically what you have is you have a distribution of

1375
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:40,590
you have is you have a distribution of ZK that we have computed and here

1376
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:44,790
ZK that we have computed and here another notion that is really city and

1377
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:47,370
another notion that is really city and what do we want to compute we want

1378
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:51,690
what do we want to compute we want basically to complete the postilions if

1379
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:53,910
basically to complete the postilions if you given all of my wife this data here

1380
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:56,730
you given all of my wife this data here right from 1/2 times T so basically what

1381
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:58,680
right from 1/2 times T so basically what you need to do is I don't want to go

1382
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,810
you need to do is I don't want to go back to any slides right you need need

1383
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:03,510
back to any slides right you need need to use the browser some updates but I

1384
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:06,390
to use the browser some updates but I gave you the court and it comes out that

1385
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:10,320
gave you the court and it comes out that the covariance matrix inverse okay of

1386
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,960
the covariance matrix inverse okay of this matrix is given by this nice

1387
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,880
this matrix is given by this nice formula and the mean is given by this

1388
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,240
formula and the mean is given by this problem trust me I have not done

1389
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,670
problem trust me I have not done anything the mystery cut and paste the

1390
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,470
anything the mystery cut and paste the previous formulas with the new symbols

1391
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:25,740
previous formulas with the new symbols that come in the context of the question

1392
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:28,590
that come in the context of the question on the top when I plug in what Gaussian

1393
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:30,390
on the top when I plug in what Gaussian I have terror web browser have there and

1394
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:32,340
I have terror web browser have there and then money nian Gao Xiang

1395
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:34,290
then money nian Gao Xiang update equations look exactly the way

1396
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:37,689
update equations look exactly the way that you have there

1397
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:37,699


1398
01:12:37,699 --> 01:12:43,270
now applications this for questions that I cut and pasted from the lien Gaussian

1399
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:44,919
I cut and pasted from the lien Gaussian system they don't look like the camera

1400
01:12:44,919 --> 01:12:46,870
system they don't look like the camera filtering your questions that they saw

1401
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:49,600
filtering your questions that they saw with you in terms of this caring metrics

1402
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,300
with you in terms of this caring metrics so the question is ways the Kalman gain

1403
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:55,090
so the question is ways the Kalman gain metrics come strong because it's not

1404
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:57,400
metrics come strong because it's not there alright so obviously the sir

1405
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,959
there alright so obviously the sir questions will not be very sort of

1406
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:04,300
questions will not be very sort of efficient way to program this because I

1407
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,790
efficient way to program this because I see English eh if you want to probably

1408
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:08,500
see English eh if you want to probably the covariance means you're going to

1409
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,760
the covariance means you're going to have to calculate the inverse of this

1410
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,400
have to calculate the inverse of this huge matrix here okay so this will not

1411
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,800
huge matrix here okay so this will not be very good when smart way to do things

1412
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,800
be very good when smart way to do things so let's look at different terms

1413
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:23,410
so let's look at different terms okay so I am cloning here the first

1414
01:13:23,410 --> 01:13:26,530
okay so I am cloning here the first equation can actually be invented in

1415
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:28,380
equation can actually be invented in this nice form that you see here

1416
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:31,390
this nice form that you see here can you guess without again saying that

1417
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:33,220
can you guess without again saying that any derivation from whether the question

1418
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:35,700
any derivation from whether the question may be coming can you guess that somehow

1419
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,709
may be coming can you guess that somehow if I take this and I invert it that

1420
01:13:38,709 --> 01:13:42,459
if I take this and I invert it that Sigma T is actually given by this does

1421
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:44,020
Sigma T is actually given by this does it visually

1422
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,729
it visually anything that we have seen like a few

1423
01:13:45,729 --> 01:13:49,600
anything that we have seen like a few slides back the matrix inversion name

1424
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,090
slides back the matrix inversion name are the Woodbury identity okay so

1425
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:53,890
are the Woodbury identity okay so basically to try to invert this

1426
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:57,070
basically to try to invert this basically you get captain page change of

1427
01:13:57,070 --> 01:14:01,120
basically you get captain page change of symbols you get this nice you know

1428
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:08,500
symbols you get this nice you know equation here and if you noticed the

1429
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:11,800
equation here and if you noticed the wrist okay there is a steep PT minus 1

1430
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,320
wrist okay there is a steep PT minus 1 so this is the covariance of the

1431
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,990
so this is the covariance of the predictive one step ahead using date

1432
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:19,419
predictive one step ahead using date only of the t minus 1 we have computed

1433
01:14:19,419 --> 01:14:22,570
only of the t minus 1 we have computed that so I can put this outside and this

1434
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:25,630
that so I can put this outside and this whole matrix of the city I'm sorry this

1435
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:28,630
whole matrix of the city I'm sorry this whole matrix there is what we defined to

1436
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,640
whole matrix there is what we defined to be the Kalman gain matrix

1437
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,890
be the Kalman gain matrix okay okay so Gaussian linear

1438
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:37,260
okay okay so Gaussian linear equation manipulation to give us these

1439
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,540
equation manipulation to give us these two equations and then we can see Sigma

1440
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:42,660
two equations and then we can see Sigma T so we get this terminal update

1441
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:44,850
T so we get this terminal update basically directly in terms of Sigma T

1442
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:46,620
basically directly in terms of Sigma T and I'm going to give you the update now

1443
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:51,420
and I'm going to give you the update now for the mean because before when I can

1444
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,270
for the mean because before when I can go back all right should we write this

1445
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:56,940
go back all right should we write this nice update for Sigma now I have to give

1446
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:58,740
nice update for Sigma now I have to give you the update from you

1447
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:00,480
you the update from you the student deriving the Kalman equation

1448
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:05,430
the student deriving the Kalman equation is also a trivial task okay so crazy

1449
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:12,480
is also a trivial task okay so crazy update for me so the let me just go back

1450
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,250
update for me so the let me just go back to be sure that we are talking about

1451
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:17,970
to be sure that we are talking about okay so then I now have know from you

1452
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:20,850
okay so then I now have know from you know from this multiplication here this

1453
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,410
know from this multiplication here this is what you get from the linear dowser

1454
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:23,880
is what you get from the linear dowser system right so we need to manipulate

1455
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:26,820
system right so we need to manipulate this to get within a much more tractable

1456
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:29,010
this to get within a much more tractable flow so I'm going to rewrite this

1457
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:31,350
flow so I'm going to rewrite this equation that you see here so I can

1458
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:35,850
equation that you see here so I can start working it so this equation is has

1459
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:37,710
start working it so this equation is has two terms some when I work on each of

1460
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:42,630
two terms some when I work on each of these two terms technically okay so the

1461
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:44,400
these two terms technically okay so the first equation that looks painful

1462
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:49,620
first equation that looks painful all right now let's say Y is not bad so

1463
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:52,380
all right now let's say Y is not bad so there is a sigma theta minus 1 inverse x

1464
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:55,620
there is a sigma theta minus 1 inverse x nu t t minus 1 I need it exist and for

1465
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:58,230
nu t t minus 1 I need it exist and for Sigma I use the update in terms of a

1466
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:00,750
Sigma I use the update in terms of a power gain matrix K that we just like

1467
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:03,660
power gain matrix K that we just like okay so the first term immediately is

1468
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:05,400
okay so the first term immediately is written in terms of the carbon game

1469
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,070
written in terms of the carbon game ethics play in a very nice form very

1470
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:10,470
ethics play in a very nice form very convenient update okay

1471
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:12,510
convenient update okay very we need to update the stigma T

1472
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:16,890
very we need to update the stigma T times T transpose where is it so we need

1473
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:21,810
times T transpose where is it so we need of data tab and again Sigma T is written

1474
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:25,770
of data tab and again Sigma T is written by this nice thing times this times YP

1475
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:31,750
by this nice thing times this times YP and what I have done is now I

1476
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:31,760


1477
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:37,910
do anything if I put them aside they invest okay

1478
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:40,850
invest okay it comes out the you can write this

1479
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:41,930
it comes out the you can write this whole thing here

1480
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,700
whole thing here there's no mill and then to do anything

1481
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,590
there's no mill and then to do anything like that you can write it this this

1482
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:47,930
like that you can write it this this matrix and this matrix is really to come

1483
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:51,160
matrix and this matrix is really to come up in the metric scale so the update

1484
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:56,660
up in the metric scale so the update committee is basically new P P minus 1

1485
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:59,270
committee is basically new P P minus 1 plus this Kalman gain metrics times

1486
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:01,550
plus this Kalman gain metrics times basically internal methods that

1487
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:05,240
basically internal methods that attention you will stand between the

1488
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:09,470
attention you will stand between the observation right P and the distribution

1489
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:20,300
observation right P and the distribution for y -1 okay so basically those are the

1490
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:25,400
for y -1 okay so basically those are the updates okay and you actually phase with

1491
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,020
updates okay and you actually phase with a comma filtering equations right if you

1492
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:30,680
a comma filtering equations right if you look but looks the mystery chapters from

1493
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,900
look but looks the mystery chapters from this but really playing with with their

1494
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,790
this but really playing with with their identity and the guys earlier systems

1495
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:36,770
identity and the guys earlier systems the questions the derivation is

1496
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:40,220
the questions the derivation is basically a few slides okay if you don't

1497
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:42,250
basically a few slides okay if you don't actually this and we will do this using

1498
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:44,720
actually this and we will do this using message passing it will look pain

1499
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,729
message passing it will look pain through the derivation that interesting

1500
01:17:46,729 --> 01:17:49,400
through the derivation that interesting is that message passing algorithm can

1501
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,860
is that message passing algorithm can actually extend the Kalman filter to all

1502
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:54,140
actually extend the Kalman filter to all sort of distributions all sort of

1503
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:56,209
sort of distributions all sort of dynamics and observation model so if you

1504
01:17:56,209 --> 01:17:58,250
dynamics and observation model so if you like you could model is noisy to know

1505
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:02,000
like you could model is noisy to know Gaussian supports on the street
