68
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,000
时间是时间的信息暗示了句子中的顺序，所以不是
sequence in a sentence okay so it's not really I mean you can apply this as

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,240
真的，我的意思是说您可以在说话没问题时将其应用为反对，所以这
sequence in a sentence okay so it's not really I mean you can apply this as

代数，但即使对于隐马尔可夫模型，也具有很强的通用性
even for hidden Markov models that he understands this we can understand a

129
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,140
了解这一点，我们可以了解一些更复杂的专业模型
even for hidden Markov models that he understands this we can understand a

130
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,050
了解这一点，我们可以了解一些更复杂的专业模型
understands this we can understand a little bit more complex pro model the

131
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,060
了解这一点，我们可以了解一些更复杂的专业模型
little bit more complex pro model the Markov chain is rather hidden Markov

132
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,339
马尔可夫链是相当隐蔽的马尔可夫模型，所以我们有了下一个Ronix
little bit more complex pro model the Markov chain is rather hidden Markov

133
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,279
马尔可夫链是相当隐蔽的马尔可夫模型，所以我们有了下一个Ronix

134
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:50,289
马尔可夫链是相当隐蔽的马尔可夫模型，所以我们有了下一个Ronix
model right so we have it's a next Ronix to our X capital T so using conditional

135
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:53,879
到我们的X大写T，所以使用条件独立关系，我们喜欢这样
model right so we have it's a next Ronix to our X capital T so using conditional

136
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,770
到我们的X大写T，所以使用条件独立关系，我们喜欢这样
to our X capital T so using conditional independence relations we like this like

137
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:55,780
到我们的X大写T，所以使用条件独立关系，我们喜欢这样
independence relations we like this like that this is the probability of the

00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:11,519
我可以用您在第三种方法中看到的更好的格式进行测试
state X want you to XT minus 1 to X T and I can run a test in a much nicer

145
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,010
我可以用您在第三种方法中看到的更好的格式进行测试
and I can run a test in a much nicer format the way that you see on the third

146
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,020
我可以用您在第三种方法中看到的更好的格式进行测试
format the way that you see on the third lines I want you to pay close attention

147
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,200
我希望您密切注意这些行，因为这种表示法非常
format the way that you see on the third lines I want you to pay close attention

148
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,320
我希望您密切注意这些行，因为这种表示法非常
lines I want you to pay close attention because sort of the notation is very

149
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,330
我希望您密切注意这些行，因为这种表示法非常
because sort of the notation is very standard these are many other problems

150
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,129
标准这些是混合模型之类的许多其他问题，所以您
because sort of the notation is very standard these are many other problems

151
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:25,559
标准这些是混合模型之类的许多其他问题，所以您
standard these are many other problems for mixed models and and the like so you

152
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:25,569
标准这些是混合模型之类的许多其他问题，所以您
for mixed models and and the like so you know this is a standard way to write the

153
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:27,749
知道在给定的情况下这是写联合概率分布的标准方法
for mixed models and and the like so you know this is a standard way to write the

154
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:30,329
知道在给定的情况下这是写联合概率分布的标准方法
know this is a standard way to write the joint probability distribution given the

00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:35,289
参数和参数在这里指的是初始的概率
to the probability the initial probabilities of being upstaged a and

159
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,930
升级的概率a和过渡概率可能带有
to the probability the initial probabilities of being upstaged a and

160
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,010
升级的概率a和过渡概率可能带有
probabilities of being upstaged a and the transition probabilities may carry

161
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:40,020
升级的概率a和过渡概率可能带有
the transition probabilities may carry transitioning from state a to state K so

162
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,570
从状态a过渡到状态K，所以再看一遍，这是否有意义
the transition probabilities may carry transitioning from state a to state K so

163
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,659
从状态a过渡到状态K，所以再看一遍，这是否有意义
transitioning from state a to state K so look at this again does this make sense

164
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:47,669
从状态a过渡到状态K，所以再看一遍，这是否有意义
look at this again does this make sense is this the same as what we see up there

165
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:52,979
这和我们在那里看到的一样吗
look at this again does this make sense is this the same as what we see up there

166
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,620
所以你怎么理解现在看不到x1的概率
look at this again does this make sense is this the same as what we see up there

167
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:54,630
所以你怎么理解现在看不到x1的概率


168
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,570
所以你怎么理解现在看不到x1的概率
so how do you understand can't see the probability of x1 now this is written

169
00:07:59,570 --> 00:07:59,580
所以你怎么理解现在看不到x1的概率
probability of x1 now this is written like that so what does not mean the big

170
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,970
这样的话，这并不意味着指标功能就大了，所以它是
probability of x1 now this is written like that so what does not mean the big

171
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,070
这样的话，这并不意味着指标功能就大了，所以它是
like that so what does not mean the big is the indicator function right so it's

172
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,080
这样的话，这并不意味着指标功能就大了，所以它是
is the indicator function right so it's Rondo and the argument is school zero

173
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,680
回旋曲和论点是学校零
is the indicator function right so it's Rondo and the argument is school zero

174
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,400
回旋曲和论点是学校零
Rondo and the argument is school zero otherwise

175
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:10,410
回旋曲和论点是学校零
otherwise so as this don't do here addiction is on

176
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,870
所以在这里不做瘾，所以上瘾就在一种状态，那么我有一个空间
otherwise so as this don't do here addiction is on

177
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,960
所以在这里不做瘾，所以上瘾就在一种状态，那么我有一个空间
so as this don't do here addiction is on state one right then I have a space for

178
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:17,970
所以在这里不做瘾，所以上瘾就在一种状态，那么我有一个空间
state one right then I have a space for a lot of times

179
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,540
很多时候，如果x1等于
state one right then I have a space for a lot of times

180
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:28,040
很多时候，如果x1等于
a lot of times so if x1 is equal to let's say is the

181
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,050
很多时候，如果x1等于
so if x1 is equal to let's say is the state Z so this time what will give me

182
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,490
状态Z，所以这次会给我什么，你会给我PJ，如果x1不是a
so if x1 is equal to let's say is the state Z so this time what will give me

183
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:37,250
状态Z，所以这次会给我什么，你会给我PJ，如果x1不是a
state Z so this time what will give me you will give me PJ and if x1 isn't a

184
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:37,260
状态Z，所以这次会给我什么，你会给我PJ，如果x1不是a
you will give me PJ and if x1 isn't a means x1 is not in all the other states

185
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,710
表示x1不在其他所有状态，因此如果执行此过程，则所有尝试都将
you will give me PJ and if x1 isn't a means x1 is not in all the other states

186
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,170
表示x1不在其他所有状态，因此如果执行此过程，则所有尝试都将
means x1 is not in all the other states so if this process all the attempts will

187
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:42,180
表示x1不在其他所有状态，因此如果执行此过程，则所有尝试都将
so if this process all the attempts will give me basically a power of 0 which

188
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,660
基本上给我0的幂，好吧，结果为1好吧，所以这
so if this process all the attempts will give me basically a power of 0 which

189
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,040
基本上给我0的幂，好吧，结果为1好吧，所以这
give me basically a power of 0 which will result to 1 okay all right so this

190
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,050
基本上给我0的幂，好吧，结果为1好吧，所以这
will result to 1 okay all right so this is the way to write P of x1 and

191
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,880
是写x1的P的方法，
will result to 1 okay all right so this is the way to write P of x1 and

192
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:03,730
句子，每个句子的长度都是T，没错，所以这是税收上要说的
will result to 1 okay all right so this is the way to write P of x1 and

193
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:03,740
句子，每个句子的长度都是T，没错，所以这是税收上要说的


194
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,930
句子，每个句子的长度都是T，没错，所以这是税收上要说的
sentences each with length T all right so this is the one would say in tax but

195
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:08,940
句子，每个句子的长度都是T，没错，所以这是税收上要说的
so this is the one would say in tax but has okay so this is a point remove a

196
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,070
没关系，所以这是一个重点，删除一个序列，这是一个很漂亮的
so this is the one would say in tax but has okay so this is a point remove a

197
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,890
没关系，所以这是一个重点，删除一个序列，这是一个很漂亮的
has okay so this is a point remove a sequence this is a beautiful in the

198
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:15,900
没关系，所以这是一个重点，删除一个序列，这是一个很漂亮的
sequence this is a beautiful in the states of J and K and this probability

199
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,620
J和K的状态，以及说JK到此的转变概率
sequence this is a beautiful in the states of J and K and this probability

200
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,540
J和K的状态，以及说JK到此的转变概率
states of J and K and this probability of transitions to say JK to this

201
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:20,550
J和K的状态，以及说JK到此的转变概率
of transitions to say JK to this indicator function transitioning from J

202
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,180
指标函数从T的J减1到K以及对
of transitions to say JK to this indicator function transitioning from J

203
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:32,810
指标函数从T的J减1到K以及对
indicator function transitioning from J of T minus 1 to K and what interested to

204
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:32,820
指标函数从T的J减1到K以及对
of T minus 1 to K and what interested to compute a JK I mean most of the things

205
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,330
计算一个JK，我的意思是直到现在我们已经完成了大部分工作，我们假设
of T minus 1 to K and what interested to compute a JK I mean most of the things

206
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,690
计算一个JK，我的意思是直到现在我们已经完成了大部分工作，我们假设
compute a JK I mean most of the things we have done up to now we assume that

207
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:37,700
计算一个JK，我的意思是直到现在我们已经完成了大部分工作，我们假设
we have done up to now we assume that this parameters are known now we don't

208
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,520
现在我们知道这些参数，我们将不知道这些参数。
we have done up to now we assume that this parameters are known now we don't

209
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,710
现在我们知道这些参数，我们将不知道这些参数。
this parameters are known now we don't know these parameters and we're going to

210
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
现在我们知道这些参数，我们将不知道这些参数。
know these parameters and we're going to compute them from data so interesting

211
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,550
从数据中计算它们，所以有趣的是
know these parameters and we're going to compute them from data so interesting

212
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,820
从数据中计算它们，所以有趣的是
compute them from data so interesting here will be

213
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:49,830
从数据中计算它们，所以有趣的是
here will be this one will it's a sequence of words

214
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,510
这将是一个冗长的单词序列，但现在我要
here will be this one will it's a sequence of words

215
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,330
这将是一个冗长的单词序列，但现在我要
this one will it's a sequence of words of lengthy but now I'm going to have any

216
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:56,340
这将是一个冗长的单词序列，但现在我要
of lengthy but now I'm going to have any sequence of words each of them having

217
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,290
单词的顺序，每个单词的长度都正确，所以我要
of lengthy but now I'm going to have any sequence of words each of them having

218
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:04,400
单词的顺序，每个单词的长度都正确，所以我要
sequence of words each of them having length all right so I'm going to

219
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:04,410
单词的顺序，每个单词的长度都正确，所以我要
length all right so I'm going to basically text of different lengths so

220
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,120
基本上是不同长度的文本，所以x1我们执行了一个冗长的单词
length all right so I'm going to basically text of different lengths so

221
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,960
基本上是不同长度的文本，所以x1我们执行了一个冗长的单词
basically text of different lengths so x1 we have a lengthy one words executed

222
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:11,970
基本上是不同长度的文本，所以x1我们执行了一个冗长的单词
x1 we have a lengthy one words executed 2 etc but if you not you can take that

223
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,650
2等等，但是如果您不这样做，则可以认为每一个的长度都相同
x1 we have a lengthy one words executed 2 etc but if you not you can take that

224
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,060
2等等，但是如果您不这样做，则可以认为每一个的长度都相同
2 etc but if you not you can take that the length of each of this is the same

225
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,070
2等等，但是如果您不这样做，则可以认为每一个的长度都相同
the length of each of this is the same so the is given semester of the logs i

226
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:26,660
所以给定了学期的日志，我给出了theta，我正在那样做
the length of each of this is the same so the is given semester of the logs i

227
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,210
所以给定了学期的日志，我给出了theta，我正在那样做
so the is given semester of the logs i given theta and i'm making it like that

228
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:29,220
所以给定了学期的日志，我给出了theta，我正在那样做
given theta and i'm making it like that so i want you to look hard from this

229
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,490
所以我想让您从这个方程式中仔细观察第三行
given theta and i'm making it like that so i want you to look hard from this

230
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,930
所以我想让您从这个方程式中仔细观察第三行
so i want you to look hard from this equation the third line a went to the

231
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:34,940
所以我想让您从这个方程式中仔细观察第三行
equation the third line a went to the nothing to it questions this make sense

232
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,920
毫无疑问，这是有道理的
equation the third line a went to the nothing to it questions this make sense

233
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,510
来描述估计轮渡员，这是我所有的数据集，我将其推入了工作中
equation the third line a went to the nothing to it questions this make sense

234
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:40,520
来描述估计轮渡员，这是我所有的数据集，我将其推入了工作中


235
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,980
来描述估计轮渡员，这是我所有的数据集，我将其推入了工作中
to describe estimation ferrymen which is all my data sets i push it in the works

236
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:45,990
来描述估计轮渡员，这是我所有的数据集，我将其推入了工作中
all my data sets i push it in the works okay and I left the summation so maybe

237
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,310
好吧，我离开了总结部分，所以也许人们预定了这种进步，
all my data sets i push it in the works okay and I left the summation so maybe

238
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,230
好吧，我离开了总结部分，所以也许人们预定了这种进步，
okay and I left the summation so maybe people books this progress ever becomes

239
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:51,240
好吧，我离开了总结部分，所以也许人们预定了这种进步，
people books this progress ever becomes summation right so I first destination

240
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,360
求和正确，所以我首先要到达外面的州
people books this progress ever becomes summation right so I first destination

241
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,720
求和正确，所以我首先要到达外面的州
summation right so I first destination over the states outside and this

242
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:56,730
求和正确，所以我首先要到达外面的州
over the states outside and this summation over the data sets they push

243

我实际上希望这样做，几分钟后您就可以预测下一个
can do predictions you know you can and I will do it actually hopefully in a few

484
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,610
我实际上希望这样做，几分钟后您就可以预测下一个
I will do it actually hopefully in a few minutes you can predict what the next

485
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:18,620
我实际上希望这样做，几分钟后您就可以预测下一个
minutes you can predict what the next word is going to be but why do we need

486
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,430
这个词将会是，但是为什么我们需要做贝叶斯呢？
minutes you can predict what the next word is going to be but why do we need

487
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,610
这个词将会是，但是为什么我们需要做贝叶斯呢？
word is going to be but why do we need to do Bayesian rather much more likely

488
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:24,620
这个词将会是，但是为什么我们需要做贝叶斯呢？
to do Bayesian rather much more likely if it's there in the specific mode of

489
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:31,030
如果在语言模型的特定模式下存在，那会出错

the language model what can go wrong with family

492
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,160
和家人一起
the language model what can go wrong with family

493
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:43,640
这样我们就可以在训练句子中说出您缺少的句子
the language model what can go wrong with family

so that we would say in the training sentences which is missing would you

496
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:48,180
这样我们就可以在训练句子中说出您缺少的句子
sentences which is missing would you ever be able to predict that work no

497
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,650
曾经能够预测这项工作不好，所以显然有很多
sentences which is missing would you ever be able to predict that work no

498
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,130

553
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:58,220
是NK /是的，所以让我们来看看如何获​​得测量模型
take how we get the measure model for this let me put all of this thing up

554
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,740
这让我把所有这些东西都放起来了，实际上这很简单，但是假设
take how we get the measure model for this let me put all of this thing up

555
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,400
这让我把所有这些东西都放起来了，实际上这很简单，但是假设
this let me put all of this thing up actually this is very simple but assumes

556
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,410
这让我把所有这些东西都放起来了，实际上这很简单，但是假设
actually this is very simple but assumes that you know something about different

557
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,580
您会像以前一样了解不同的分布，所以这是
actually this is very simple but assumes that you know something about different

558
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:10,180
您会像以前一样了解不同的分布，所以这是
that you know something about different distributions as prior so this is the

559
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,190
您会像以前一样了解不同的分布，所以这是
distributions as prior so this is the situation and this is the matrix a that

560
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:18,490
情况，这是矩阵a，我的所有观察都在搅动它
distributions as prior so this is the situation and this is the matrix a that

562
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:20,450
情况，这是矩阵a，我的所有观察都在搅动它
is being stirred by all my observations so that's why you see these links like

563
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,350
所以这就是为什么您看到这些链接，而每个链接都是第一个
is being stirred by all my observations so that's why you see these links like

564
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,160
所以这就是为什么您看到这些链接，而每个链接都是第一个
so that's why you see these links like that and each of this is the first in

565
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,170
所以这就是为什么您看到这些链接，而每个链接都是第一个
that and each of this is the first in the a matrix so if you think this will

566
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,840
这个矩阵，所以如果您认为这将给我过渡的可能性
that and each of this is the first in the a matrix so if you think this will

567
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,700
这个矩阵，所以如果您认为这将给我过渡的可能性
the a matrix so if you think this will give me the probabilities to transition

568
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:33,710
这个矩阵，所以如果您认为这将给我过渡的可能性
give me the probabilities to transition from one to state to state one from one

569
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,720
从一状态到一状态从一到清从一二三一二
give me the probabilities to transition from one to state to state one from one

570
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,700
从一状态到一状态从一到清从一二三一二
from one to state to state one from one to clear from one two three one two

571
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:39,710
从一状态到一状态从一到清从一二三一二
to clear from one two three one two three etc so the sum of these things is

572
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,460
三个等等，所以这些东西的总和等于1好
to clear from one two three one two three etc so the sum of these things is

573
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,490
三个等等，所以这些东西的总和等于1好
three etc so the sum of these things is equal to 1 okay

574
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:45,500
三个等等，所以这些东西的总和等于1好
equal to 1 okay so then this will give you the

575
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,040
因此，这将为您提供从已知的过渡-好的
equal to 1 okay so then this will give you the

576
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:54,790
因此，这将为您提供从已知的过渡-好的
so then this will give you the transition from you know the one - okay

577
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:54,800
因此，这将为您提供从已知的过渡-好的
transition from you know the one - okay and so I'm going to take the pitch of

578
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,810
因此，我将采用这种玫瑰紫水晶的音调，然后
transition from you know the one - okay and so I'm going to take the pitch of

579
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:06,250
因此，我将采用这种玫瑰紫水晶的音调，然后
and so I'm going to take the pitch of this Rose amethyst and then I'm going to

580
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:06,260
因此，我将采用这种玫瑰紫水晶的音调，然后
this Rose amethyst and then I'm going to do is I am going to put a on each of

581
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,220
我要做的是将这些行的每一行都放好，这一行将
this Rose amethyst and then I'm going to do is I am going to put a on each of

582
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,950
我要做的是将这些行的每一行都放好，这一行将
do is I am going to put a on each of these rows okay and this one is going to

583
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:11,960
我要做的是将这些行的每一行都放好，这一行将
these rows okay and this one is going to be the declare distribution that looks

584
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,940
是看起来您在此处看到距离的方式的声明分布
these rows okay and this one is going to be the declare distribution that looks

585
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:21,310
是看起来您在此处看到距离的方式的声明分布
be the declare distribution that looks the way that you see here the distance

586
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:21,320
是看起来您在此处看到距离的方式的声明分布
the way that you see here the distance basically from silty clay have been

587
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,710
基本上是用粉质黏土写的有趣的方式
the way that you see here the distance basically from silty clay have been

588
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,320
基本上是用粉质黏土写的有趣的方式
basically from silty clay have been written in an interesting way where I

589
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,330
基本上是用粉质黏土写的有趣的方式
written in an interesting way where I have the time you know it's not from the

590
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:31,660
有时间知道不是细节，基本上是0
written in an interesting way where I have the time you know it's not from the

591
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,970
有时间知道不是细节，基本上是0
have the time you know it's not from the details but basically a 0 comes

592
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:33,980
有时间知道不是细节，基本上是0
details but basically a 0 comes everywhere then I have M 0 2 and carry

593
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,340
到处都有M 0 2并携带，所以这是如果您可以取平均值的话
details but basically a 0 comes everywhere then I have M 0 2 and carry

594
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,100
到处都有M 0 2并携带，所以这是如果您可以取平均值的话
everywhere then I have M 0 2 and carry so this is if you can take the mean of

595
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,110
到处都有M 0 2并携带，所以这是如果您可以取平均值的话
so this is if you can take the mean of this declare distribution the mean comes

596
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,320
此声明分布的平均值为N ok，其强度为
so this is if you can take the mean of this declare distribution the mean comes

597
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,830
此声明分布的平均值为N ok，其强度为
this declare distribution the mean comes to the N ok and the strength of which is

598
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:44,840
此声明分布的平均值为N ok，其强度为
to the N ok and the strength of which is defined by this coefficient of 0 okay so

599
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,840
由这个系数定义为0还可以
to the N ok and the strength of which is defined by this coefficient of 0 okay so

600
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,130
由这个系数定义为0还可以
defined by this coefficient of 0 okay so so

601
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:50,140
由这个系数定义为0还可以
let's see what this is going to do some of these min satisfies the stomach

602
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,970
我将把它强加在捆绑包上，所以让我们看看这将做些什么
let's see what this is going to do some of these min satisfies the stomach

603
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,990
这些最小的满足胃套必须煮好一个，所以
let's see what this is going to do some of these min satisfies the stomach

604
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:03,210
这些最小的满足胃套必须煮好一个，所以
of these min satisfies the stomach encase has to be cooked one alright so

605
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:03,220
这些最小的满足胃套必须煮好一个，所以
encase has to be cooked one alright so this is the prior and I claim that the

606
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:09,570
这是先验的，我声称对于它的后验，你知道我可以说，
encase has to be cooked one alright so this is the prior and I claim that the

607
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:14,010
这是先验的，我声称对于它的后验，你知道我可以说，
this is the prior and I claim that the posterior for its you know I can say and

00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,810
距离这基本上不是一个更好的方式
so the posterior distribution looks it's not going close from the way that this

680
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:07,460
距离这基本上不是一个更好的方式
not going close from the way that this is this basically to do a better

language model that's one thing and secondly how do you actually can go and

685
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:17,690
其次，您实际上如何去问您有关0名称的问题
language model that's one thing and secondly how do you actually can go and

686
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,120
其次，您实际上如何去问您有关0名称的问题
secondly how do you actually can go and ask you something about that for 0 name

687
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,130
其次，您实际上如何去问您有关0名称的问题
ask you something about that for 0 name okay so how do you find this parameter

688
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,660
好的，那么您如何找到先前看到的此参数，但请确保
ask you something about that for 0 name okay so how do you find this parameter

689
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,680
好的，那么您如何找到先前看到的此参数，但请确保
okay so how do you find this parameter seen in the prior but make sure

690
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,940
我们减少声望仍然是JK，所以每个都是
okay so how do you find this parameter seen in the prior but make sure

691
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:30,950
我们减少声望仍然是JK，所以每个都是


692
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:37,640
我们减少声望仍然是JK，所以每个都是
we reduce the prestige remain a JK so each of this is that the declared

693
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,650
我们减少声望仍然是JK，所以每个都是
each of this is that the declared distribution we're going to use the

694
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,960
分布，我们将使用后验最小值和后验均值
each of this is that the declared distribution we're going to use the

695
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,850
分布，我们将使用后验最小值和后验均值

696
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:40,860
分布，我们将使用后验最小值和后验均值
posterior min and the posterior mean basically for the this distribution if

697
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,890
基本上，对于这种分布，如果您将每个分区都设为K
posterior min and the posterior mean basically for the this distribution if

698
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,140
基本上，对于这种分布，如果您将每个分区都设为K
basically for the this distribution if you take each of the partitions the K

699
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,150
基本上，对于这种分布，如果您将每个分区都设为K
you take each of the partitions the K partition it will be M say k plus alpha

700
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,540
分区是M说k加alpha 0 MK / MJ假设晚餐，好的，所以
you take each of the partitions the K partition it will be M say k plus alpha

701
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:58,820
分区是M说k加alpha 0 MK / MJ假设晚餐，好的，所以
partition it will be M say k plus alpha 0 MK / MJ suppose dinner and okay so

702
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:58,830
分区是M说k加alpha 0 MK / MJ假设晚餐，好的，所以
0 MK / MJ suppose dinner and okay so into the trade is the frequency of

703
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:02,120
进入交易的频率是从J到K乘以n J的频率，这是
0 MK / MJ suppose dinner and okay so into the trade is the frequency of

704
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,810
进入交易的频率是从J到K乘以n J的频率，这是
into the trade is the frequency of transition from J to K times n J this is

705
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:05,820
进入交易的频率是从J到K乘以n J的频率，这是
transition from J to K times n J this is what we came with family estimation plus

706
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,840
我们得出的家庭估计数加上1加0乘以MK和J加上alpha 0和
transition from J to K times n J this is what we came with family estimation plus

707
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,530
我们得出的家庭估计数加上1加0乘以MK和J加上alpha 0和
what we came with family estimation plus 1 plus 0 times MK and J plus alpha 0 and

708
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:12,540
我们得出的家庭估计数加上1加0乘以MK和J加上alpha 0和
1 plus 0 times MK and J plus alpha 0 and I can write this expression like this

709
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,350
我可以像这样为lambda J编写这样的表达式：alpha 0 / MJ plus alpha
1 plus 0 times MK and J plus alpha 0 and I can write this expression like this

710
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:19,850
我可以像这样为lambda J编写这样的表达式：alpha 0 / MJ plus alpha
I can write this expression like this for lambda J is alpha 0 / MJ plus alpha

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:19,860
我可以像这样为lambda J编写这样的表达式：alpha 0 / MJ plus alpha
for lambda J is alpha 0 / MJ plus alpha 0 so basically this approximation that

712
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,420
0基本上就是这个近似值，人们在出现之前就已经介绍过了
for lambda J is alpha 0 / MJ plus alpha 0 so basically this approximation that

713
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,180
0基本上就是这个近似值，人们在出现之前就已经介绍过了
0 so basically this approximation that people introduced before it comes out to

714
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:26,190
0基本上就是这个近似值，人们在出现之前就已经介绍过了
people introduced before it comes out to be actually the posterior min when it

715
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,860
当它在滚动时使用非常清晰的先验时，实际上是后验分钟
people introduced before it comes out to be actually the posterior min when it

716
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,860
当它在滚动时使用非常清晰的先验时，实际上是后验分钟

00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:30,870
当它在滚动时使用非常清晰的先验时，实际上是后验分钟
uses very clear prior on the rolls of the transition matrix a JK okay so the

718
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:37,220
过渡矩阵一个JK好吧，所以第一个晚上因为0
uses very clear prior on the rolls of the transition matrix a JK okay so the

719
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:44,120
过渡矩阵一个JK好吧，所以第一个晚上因为0

720
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,130
过渡矩阵一个JK好吧，所以第一个晚上因为0
first evening because the 0 the procedure mean really is the transition

721
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,490
过程均值实际上是从状态a到状态K的转变概率
first evening because the 0 the procedure mean really is the transition

722

00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:17,310
好的，所以问题是代表所有先驱者都可以，这不是
going to be okay and that is not a trivial problem so I'm going to if it's

735
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:28,400
琐碎的问题，所以我要去了解一下它是否可能以某种方式知道

so remember we multiply all right we multiply and then we got a posterior

754
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:20,730
所以请记住我们乘以好，然后乘以，然后得到后验

00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:07,430
您说多少次战争还可以，孟菲斯UNC就有一个例子
and there is an example in Memphis UNC okay and you know this that always comes

851
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:11,300
好吧，你知道这总是在你之后

okay and you know this that always comes after you

853
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:12,180
好吧，你知道这总是在你之后
after you so if you need to find the transition

854
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,530
因此，如果您需要找到过渡概率，基本上可以给
after you so if you need to find the transition

855
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,470

since you are interested in model the transition from one world to another

887
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,660
从一个世界过渡到另一个世界，这次您可以想到
since you are interested in model the transition from one world to another

888
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,570
从一个世界过渡到另一个世界，这次您可以想到
transition from one world to another this you can think of this this time so

889
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:35,580
从一个世界过渡到另一个世界，这次您可以想到
this you can think of this this time so you can use ideas from sequence to

890
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,370
您可以使用从顺序到蒙特卡洛的想法来做到这一点
this you can think of this this time so you can use ideas from sequence to

您可以使用从顺序到蒙特卡洛的想法来做到这一点
you can use ideas from sequence to Montecarlo to do that

892
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:39,990
您可以使用从顺序到蒙特卡洛的想法来做到这一点
Montecarlo to do that into service no parametric methods but I

893
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,650
没有参数化方法投入使用，但我知道通过减少，我可以回到这里
Montecarlo to do that into service no parametric methods but I

894
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,820
没有参数化方法投入使用，但我知道通过减少，我可以回到这里
into service no parametric methods but I know by reducing I can go back here I

895
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:46,830
没有参数化方法投入使用，但我知道通过减少，我可以回到这里
know by reducing I can go back here I have I'm using the declared distribution

896
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,640
我是否在使用已声明的分发作为先例之前知道了它的内容
know by reducing I can go back here I have I'm using the declared distribution

897
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,920
我是否在使用已声明的分发作为先例之前知道了它的内容
have I'm using the declared distribution as a prior their prior you know what it

898
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:51,930
我是否在使用已声明的分发作为先例之前知道了它的内容
as a prior their prior you know what it is that they reflect process and I don't

899
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:55,280
是他们反映了过程，我不知道您会从中获利
as a prior their prior you know what it is that they reflect process and I don't

900
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,810
是他们反映了过程，我不知道您会从中获利
is that they reflect process and I don't know kind of you will do a profit from

901
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:56,820
是他们反映了过程，我不知道您会从中获利
know kind of you will do a profit from this what's the difference not

902
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,240
这不是自动的区别，但是如果我从这里去
know kind of you will do a profit from this what's the difference not

903
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,940
这不是自动的区别，但是如果我从这里去
this what's the difference not automatically but if I go from this

904
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:01,950
这不是自动的区别，但是如果我从这里去
automatically but if I go from this distribution to the clip process what

905
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,430
向剪辑过程分发您所知道的一般过程
automatically but if I go from this distribution to the clip process what

906
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,710
向剪辑过程分发您所知道的一般过程
distribution to the clip process what you know what did the process in general

907
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:06,720
向剪辑过程分发您所知道的一般过程
you know what did the process in general will allow me to do that this particular

908
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,870
可以让我做到这一点，这种特殊的模式将不允许任何人知道
you know what did the process in general will allow me to do that this particular

909
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:14,720
可以让我做到这一点，这种特殊的模式将不允许任何人知道
will allow me to do that this particular model would not allow me anybody knows

910
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:25,960
所以在这种情况下，我有从J到状态0到K的转换
will allow me to do that this particular model would not allow me anybody knows

911
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:25,970
所以在这种情况下，我有从J到状态0到K的转换


912
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:33,760
所以在这种情况下，我有从J到状态0到K的转换
so in this case right I have transitions from J to state 0 to K right in

913
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:33,770
所以在这种情况下，我有从J到状态0到K的转换
from J to state 0 to K right in different postures I'm gonna be able to

914
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,410
我将能够使用不同的姿势来处理状态
from J to state 0 to K right in different postures I'm gonna be able to

915
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:39,430
我将能够使用不同的姿势来处理状态
different postures I'm gonna be able to have transitions to handle states

916
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:39,930
安东尼好吧，这样一来，最糟糕的人就没有在会计师那里见过
different postures I'm gonna be able to have transitions to handle states

917
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:39,940
安东尼好吧，这样一来，最糟糕的人就没有在会计师那里见过


918
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:49,450
安东尼好吧，这样一来，最糟糕的人就没有在会计师那里见过
Antony okay so that way worst of you have not seen with the accountant in the

919
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:49,460
安东尼好吧，这样一来，最糟糕的人就没有在会计师那里见过
have not seen with the accountant in the private market you know because you have

920
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,849
你知道的私人市场，因为你可以过渡到所有的东西，但是我已经
have not seen with the accountant in the private market you know because you have

921
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:55,839
你知道的私人市场，因为你可以过渡到所有的东西，但是我已经
private market you know because you have transitions to everything okay but I've

922
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:55,849
你知道的私人市场，因为你可以过渡到所有的东西，但是我已经
transitions to everything okay but I've now told it will not allow you to do

923
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:59,109
现在告诉它不允许您这样做，所以raclette过程是您知道的
transitions to everything okay but I've now told it will not allow you to do

924
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:03,550
现在告诉它不允许您这样做，所以raclette过程是您知道的
now told it will not allow you to do this so the raclette process is you know

925
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:03,560
现在告诉它不允许您这样做，所以raclette过程是您知道的
this so the raclette process is you know that's why we call it a non parametric

926
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,680
这就是为什么我们称其为非参数模型，因为您实际上拥有
this so the raclette process is you know that's why we call it a non parametric

927
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,270
这就是为什么我们称其为非参数模型，因为您实际上拥有
that's why we call it a non parametric model because effectively you have

928
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,280
这就是为什么我们称其为非参数模型，因为您实际上拥有
model because effectively you have infinite parameters to define this model

929
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
无限参数定义此模型，因此，如果您对实际

930
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,120
无限参数定义此模型，因此，如果您对实际
infinite parameters to define this model so if you are interested the actually

931
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,130
无限参数定义此模型，因此，如果您对实际
so if you are interested the actually the world of tech from Oxford basically

932
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,790
牛津大学的技术世界基本上就是其中之一
so if you are interested the actually the world of tech from Oxford basically

克里斯汀的需求
to the mean of digital prior with Kristin's want

957
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:30,480
所以会得出这个报价在这里是1，这将是1
to the mean of digital prior with Kristin's want

958
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:30,490
所以会得出这个报价在这里是1，这将是1


959
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:36,620
所以会得出这个报价在这里是1，这将是1
so it will come out that this quotation here would be 1 and this would be 1

960
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:36,630
所以会得出这个报价在这里是1，这将是1
here would be 1 and this would be 1 subjectively what you will be doing in

961
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,760
从主观上讲，您将在计算后验时将要做什么
here would be 1 and this would be 1 subjectively what you will be doing in

962
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,040
从主观上讲，您将在计算后验时将要做什么
subjectively what you will be doing in computing the posterior mean you will be

963
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,050
从主观上讲，您将在计算后验时将要做什么
computing the posterior mean you will be adding the quantity 1 all the empirical

964
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,880
将所有经验牛的数量加1
computing the posterior mean you will be adding the quantity 1 all the empirical

965
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,890
将所有经验牛的数量加1
adding the quantity 1 all the empirical cows

966
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:45,900
将所有经验牛的数量加1
cows so if one word for example doesn't exist

967
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,079
因此，例如，如果训练数据集中不存在一个词，那么您将
cows so if one word for example doesn't exist

968
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,079
因此，例如，如果训练数据集中不存在一个词，那么您将
so if one word for example doesn't exist a term in the training data set you will

969
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:52,089
因此，例如，如果训练数据集中不存在一个词，那么您将
a term in the training data set you will get 1 there so the transition from J to

00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,250
在那得到1，所以从J到那个的过渡不会是0，你不会
get 1 there so the transition from J to that one will not be 0 you're not gonna

977
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,900
可以过渡到奖项了，这张图让我看到了
have a transition to an award okay and this graph would let me see

978
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:09,910
可以过渡到奖项了，这张图让我看到了
okay and this graph would let me see what the name is and plus 1 or something

979
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:14,730
名称是什么，加上1或什么是非常典型的

00:40:22,000 --> 00:41:06,780
我记得很好的地方和我在一起，所以这是令人愉快的，所以
somewhere I remember well is with me okay so this is the mouthing okay so

984
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:06,790
我记得很好的地方和我在一起，所以这是令人愉快的，所以
okay so this is the mouthing okay so here we have an evolution of the space

985
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,150
在这里，我们对空间进行了演变，就像您在这里看到的那样，这些是我的

992
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:24,450
这种长度和表示形式之类的原因是，它使我们能够
sort of this length and representations is because it allows us to take very

993
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:24,460
这种长度和表示形式之类的原因是，它使我们能够

但是现在我们要考虑的是，这是一个离散分布
this is a discrete distribution this can be we leave it on the earth so it can be

1042
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,910
是因为我们将其留在地球上，所以它可以是我们想要的任何东西，我们希望可以

00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:18,140
非常类似于高斯混合模型
mixture model okay the only difference so imagine that we

1048
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,230
唯一的区别是，想象一下，我们在
mixture model okay the only difference so imagine that we

1049
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,289
唯一的区别是，想象一下，我们在

00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:23,299
唯一的区别是，想象一下，我们在
have this liquid distance right of the mixture quotations that tells you when

1051
00:43:23,299 --> 00:43:26,819

have this liquid distance right of the mixture quotations that tells you when

1052
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:29,950
混合引语告诉您何时知道，所以我们说一下
mixture quotations that tells you when you know so let's say the parameter of

1053
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:29,960
混合引语告诉您何时知道，所以我们说一下
you know so let's say the parameter of XT given the state is a Gaussian all

1054
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,710
XT给定状态是高斯状态，也许在我们的混合模型中，

1056
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:35,150
XT给定状态是高斯状态，也许在我们的混合模型中，
right and maybe in our mixture model we have three different gaussian right so k

1057
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,529
有三个不同的高斯权，所以k等于1 2或3
right and maybe in our mixture model we have three different gaussian right so k

1059
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:40,190
有三个不同的高斯权，所以k等于1 2或3
equal 1 2 or 3 so if your sister is a data set that

1060
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:43,180
因此，如果您的姐姐是来自三个不同高斯的数据集就可以了
equal 1 2 or 3 so if your sister is a data set that

1061
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,079
因此，如果您的姐姐是来自三个不同高斯的数据集就可以了
so if your sister is a data set that comes from three different gaussian okay

1062
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:46,089
因此，如果您的姐姐是来自三个不同高斯的数据集就可以了
comes from three different gaussian okay but incident models is a little more

1063
00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:50,380
但是事件模型稍微复杂一点，因为z1和z2会再次出现

00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:41,720
指向孩子的高斯，但不会和三个孩子一起生存，你知道
survive with three you know what the state trip is gonna be on this ride the

1069
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,749
这次国家旅行将在高斯上进行，因此您开始采样
survive with three you know what the state trip is gonna be on this ride the

1070
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:46,509
这次国家旅行将在高斯上进行，因此您开始采样
state trip is gonna be on this ride the Gaussian so you start taking samples

1071
00:44:46,509 --> 00:44:46,519
这次国家旅行将在高斯上进行，因此您开始采样
Gaussian so you start taking samples from this until all so why have you find

1072
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,940
从这直到所有，所以为什么要在这个高斯身上找到自己，那是什么
Gaussian so you start taking samples from this until all so why have you find

1073
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,460
从这直到所有，所以为什么要在这个高斯身上找到自己，那是什么
from this until all so why have you find yourself on this Gaussian so what's the

1074
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:51,470
从这直到所有，所以为什么要在这个高斯身上找到自己，那是什么
yourself on this Gaussian so what's the difference of this from a Gaussian

1075
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,720
与高斯混合的区别区别很简单
yourself on this Gaussian so what's the difference of this from a Gaussian

1076
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,019
与高斯混合的区别区别很简单
difference of this from a Gaussian mixture the difference is very simple

1077
00:44:56,019 --> 00:44:56,029
与高斯混合的区别区别很简单
mixture the difference is very simple that the state are basically now a

1078
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:58,269
如果您接下来采样，该状态基本上就是马尔可夫链，这取决于
mixture the difference is very simple that the state are basically now a

1079
00:44:58,269 --> 00:45:04,960
如果您接下来采样，该状态基本上就是马尔可夫链，这取决于
that the state are basically now a Markov chain if you sample next depends

1080
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:04,970
如果您接下来采样，该状态基本上就是马尔可夫链，这取决于
Markov chain if you sample next depends what state they were before all right so

1081
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,769
他们没事之前处于什么状态，所以在很多方面这都类似于
Markov chain if you sample next depends what state they were before all right so

1082
00:45:08,769 --> 00:45:11,109
他们没事之前处于什么状态，所以在很多方面这都类似于
what state they were before all right so in many ways this is very similar to a

1083
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:11,119
他们没事之前处于什么状态，所以在很多方面这都类似于
in many ways this is very similar to a diversion mixed model behind

1087
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,660
通过马尔可夫属性，您基本上可以知道
without this all right I connected through the Markovian property basically

1088
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,690
通过马尔可夫属性，您基本上可以知道

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,010
可以取样做等，所以先生，您会得到这张图片，您会在左侧看到
this picture that you see on the left okay so it is a very exactly like a

1138
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:09,290
好吧，所以它非常像高斯混合，唯一的区别是
this picture that you see on the left okay so it is a very exactly like a

1139
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,000
好吧，所以它非常像高斯混合，唯一的区别是
okay so it is a very exactly like a Gaussian mixture the only difference is

1140
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,010
好吧，所以它非常像高斯混合，唯一的区别是
Gaussian mixture the only difference is in a Gaussian mixture you don't have

1141
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,890
在高斯混合中，您没有这种过渡概率，我们
Gaussian mixture the only difference is in a Gaussian mixture you don't have

1142
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:15,380
在高斯混合中，您没有这种过渡概率，我们
in a Gaussian mixture you don't have this transition probability which we

1143
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:15,390
在高斯混合中，您没有这种过渡概率，我们
this transition probability which we have here okay because we're running out

1144
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:24,440
在这里还可以，因为如果我不能撒尿，我们的时间就不多了
this transition probability which we have here okay because we're running out

1145
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,220
在这里还可以，因为如果我不能撒尿，我们的时间就不多了
have here okay because we're running out of time if I can't pee

1146
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:37,910
不，我看不到，我现在必须要利用你的想象力，因为
have here okay because we're running out of time if I can't pee

1147
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:37,920
不，我看不到，我现在必须要利用你的想象力，因为


1148
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,860
不，我看不到，我现在必须要利用你的想象力，因为
nope I don't see it I'm gonna have to I have to use your imagination now because

1149
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:42,870
不，我看不到，我现在必须要利用你的想象力，因为
have to use your imagination now because who knows what try this now okay

1150
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:47,420
谁知道现在尝试这个好吗
have to use your imagination now because who knows what try this now okay

1151
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,069
我可以写出C 1的初始概率，因为最终
have to use your imagination now because who knows what try this now okay

1152
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:50,079
我可以写出C 1的初始概率，因为最终


1153
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:57,339
我可以写出C 1的初始概率，因为最终
it was made that I can write the initial probability of C 1 because eventually

1154
00:47:57,339 --> 00:47:57,349
我可以写出C 1的初始概率，因为最终
probability of C 1 because eventually we're going to be interesting to do

1155
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:59,020
我们将很有趣地在此进行参数的影响
probability of C 1 because eventually we're going to be interesting to do

1156
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,030
我们将很有趣地在此进行参数的影响
we're going to be interesting to do influence of the parameters in this

1157
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,040
我们将很有趣地在此进行参数的影响
influence of the parameters in this distribution I can write it like that

1158
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,130
分布，我可以这样写，这样你就可以做些什么
influence of the parameters in this distribution I can write it like that

1159
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,290
分布，我可以这样写，这样你就可以做些什么
distribution I can write it like that so you can do something exactly what

1160
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:05,300
分布，我可以这样写，这样你就可以做些什么
so you can do something exactly what this equation gives me on the bottom so

1161
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,530
这个方程式使我处于最底层，所以我在这里假设状态D 1为
so you can do something exactly what this equation gives me on the bottom so

1162
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,690
这个方程式使我处于最底层，所以我在这里假设状态D 1为
this equation gives me on the bottom so I'm assuming here that the states D 1 is

1163
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:10,700
这个方程式使我处于最底层，所以我在这里假设状态D 1为
I'm assuming here that the states D 1 is discrete fixed K stage so that is PI K

1164
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:16,270
离散的固定K级，因此为PI K
I'm assuming here that the states D 1 is discrete fixed K stage so that is PI K

1165
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:21,019
是说我在什么状态还可以，在哪里的概率
I'm assuming here that the states D 1 is discrete fixed K stage so that is PI K

1166
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:21,029
是说我在什么状态还可以，在哪里的概率


1167
00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:28,999
是说我在什么状态还可以，在哪里的概率
is the probability that that would say one I am on what state okay and where is

1168
00:48:28,999 --> 00:48:29,009
是说我在什么状态还可以，在哪里的概率
one I am on what state okay and where is this coming because this discrete

1169
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:30,620
这是因为这个离散变量Z aleni
one I am on what state okay and where is this coming because this discrete

1170
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:34,519
这是因为这个离散变量Z aleni
this coming because this discrete variable Z the aleni

1171
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:34,569
所以当ZK等于RI的时候我会赢得欢呼的，意思是我说第一个
this coming because this discrete variable Z the aleni

1172
00:48:34,569 --> 00:48:34,579
所以当ZK等于RI的时候我会赢得欢呼的，意思是我说第一个


1173
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:45,259
所以当ZK等于RI的时候我会赢得欢呼的，意思是我说第一个
so I'm gonna get okay cheer win when Z K is equal to R I mean I say the first

1174
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:45,269
所以当ZK等于RI的时候我会赢得欢呼的，意思是我说第一个
is equal to R I mean I say the first risk video I should not have it here but

1175
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:48,319
冒险视频，我不应该在这里放，但是哦，嘿，第32节实际上没有
is equal to R I mean I say the first risk video I should not have it here but

1176
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:52,969
冒险视频，我不应该在这里放，但是哦，嘿，第32节实际上没有
risk video I should not have it here but oh hey the first verse 32 no actually

1177
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:52,979
冒险视频，我不应该在这里放，但是哦，嘿，第32节实际上没有
oh hey the first verse 32 no actually you know what

1178
00:48:52,979 --> 00:48:53,539
你知道这不应该是我应该什么
oh hey the first verse 32 no actually you know what

1179
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:55,789
你知道这不应该是我应该什么
you know what this should not be an i what should this

1180
00:48:55,789 --> 00:48:55,799
你知道这不应该是我应该什么
this should not be an i what should this be right so when the state you know I'm

1181
00:48:55,799 --> 00:49:02,239
是正确的，所以当您知道状态为0时，这里就是一个数据集
this should not be an i what should this be right so when the state you know I'm

1182
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:08,149
是正确的，所以当您知道状态为0时，这里就是一个数据集
be right so when the state you know I'm one dataset here right when 0 C is from

1183
00:49:08,149 --> 00:49:08,159
是正确的，所以当您知道状态为0时，这里就是一个数据集
one dataset here right when 0 C is from state that's a notation like this what's

1184
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:12,259
表示这样的符号新的1 K等于1好，所以当z1 k
one dataset here right when 0 C is from state that's a notation like this what's

1185
00:49:12,259 --> 00:49:15,529
表示这样的符号新的1 K等于1好，所以当z1 k
state that's a notation like this what's new 1 K is equal to 1 okay so when z1 k

1186
00:49:15,529 --> 00:49:15,539
表示这样的符号新的1 K等于1好，所以当z1 k
new 1 K is equal to 1 okay so when z1 k equal to 1 this will give me DK and all

1187
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:18,380
等于1，这将给我DK，而所有其他项的指数为0，所以
new 1 K is equal to 1 okay so when z1 k equal to 1 this will give me DK and all

1188
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,359
等于1，这将给我DK，而所有其他项的指数为0，所以
equal to 1 this will give me DK and all the other terms we have an exponent 0 so

1189
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:20,369
等于1，这将给我DK，而所有其他项的指数为0，所以
the other terms we have an exponent 0 so would be equal to 1 so I get basically

1190
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:22,669
等于1，所以我得到的距离基本上等于PI K
the other terms we have an exponent 0 so would be equal to 1 so I get basically

1191
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:26,949
等于1，所以我得到的距离基本上等于PI K
would be equal to 1 so I get basically the distance equal to PI K all right

1192
00:49:26,949 --> 00:49:26,959
等于1，所以我得到的距离基本上等于PI K
the distance equal to PI K all right does this make sense

1193
00:49:26,959 --> 00:49:30,319
这有意义吗
the distance equal to PI K all right does this make sense

1194
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:32,310
好吧，这基本上就是我们对于马尔可夫链所拥有的，所以
the distance equal to PI K all right does this make sense

1195
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:32,320
好吧，这基本上就是我们对于马尔可夫链所拥有的，所以


1196
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,140
好吧，这基本上就是我们对于马尔可夫链所拥有的，所以
alright this exactly basically what we had for the Markov chain right so

1197
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:37,150
好吧，这基本上就是我们对于马尔可夫链所拥有的，所以
had for the Markov chain right so there's nothing different this is the

1198
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,910
没什么不同，这是从J到K和kk中的J的过渡
had for the Markov chain right so there's nothing different this is the

1199
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:44,070
没什么不同，这是从J到K和kk中的J的过渡
there's nothing different this is the transition from J to K and J in k k

1200
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:44,080
没什么不同，这是从J到K和kk中的J的过渡
transition from J to K and J in k k dimensional right they can take K States

1201
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,230
他们可以采取K国的维权，并根据经验来实现这一目标
transition from J to K and J in k k dimensional right they can take K States

1202
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:49,430
他们可以采取K国的维权，并根据经验来实现这一目标
dimensional right they can take K States and on the experiences to make this

1203
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:49,440
他们可以采取K国的维权，并根据经验来实现这一目标
and on the experiences to make this explicit if I have GN minus 1 J this is

1204
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,580
如果我有GN减1 J，则明确表示，当N减1状态为时，此值等于1
and on the experiences to make this explicit if I have GN minus 1 J this is

1205
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:57,060
如果我有GN减1 J，则明确表示，当N减1状态为时，此值等于1
explicit if I have GN minus 1 J this is equal to 1 when the N minus 1 state is

1206
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,070
如果我有GN减1 J，则明确表示，当N减1状态为时，此值等于1
equal to 1 when the N minus 1 state is on J status and this one a time step

1207
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:00,690
关于J状态，这是一个时间步，那么我很好，所以如果这是
equal to 1 when the N minus 1 state is on J status and this one a time step

1208
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:04,380
关于J状态，这是一个时间步，那么我很好，所以如果这是
on J status and this one a time step then I'm alakay alright so if this is

1209
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:04,390

1524
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:56,840
任何你想要的好吧，我希望你看看这个表情，所以你们
anything you want okay I want you to look at this expression and so you guys

1525
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:56,850
任何你想要的好吧，我希望你看看这个表情，所以你们
look at this expression and so you guys can see it again alright so this is the

1526
01:00:56,850 --> 01:01:03,770
可以再次看到它，所以这是向后移动的消息
look at this expression and so you guys can see it again alright so this is the

1527
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:05,600
可以再次看到它，所以这是向后移动的消息
can see it again alright so this is the backward message is this moving

1528
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:05,610
可以再次看到它，所以这是向后移动的消息
backward message is this moving posterior of c30

1532
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:13,599
因此，例如，如果孩子等于1，则您知道这等于


1533
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:26,259
因此，例如，如果孩子等于1，则您知道这等于
so for example if the kids are equal to 1 you know what this is equal to is the

1534
01:01:26,259 --> 01:01:26,269
因此，例如，如果孩子等于1，则您知道这等于

01:01:31,749 --> 01:01:31,759
那些小TJ会对我们产生影响的可能性，但这也是对
onto our but is also the expectation of the Zeta TJ why because if a TJ can only

1538
01:01:31,759 --> 01:01:35,620
Zeta TJ为什么因为如果TJ只能拿一个是零或一
onto our but is also the expectation of the Zeta TJ why because if a TJ can only

1539
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:38,980
Zeta TJ为什么因为如果TJ只能拿一个是零或一
the Zeta TJ why because if a TJ can only take one is zero or one

1540
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:41,489
让我再次解释这一点，所以这是向量ZT正确，但这可能需要

先生。使命社会对米切尔太平洋的期望是因为忘记了


1580
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:36,290
先生。使命社会对米切尔太平洋的期望是因为忘记了
mr. mission social expectation of Mitchell Pacific a values because forget

1581
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:36,300
先生。使命社会对米切尔太平洋的期望是因为忘记了
Mitchell Pacific a values because forget about it so this is also the expectation

1582
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:41,050
关于它，所以这也是期望，所以你可以在这里看这个方程
Mitchell Pacific a values because forget about it so this is also the expectation

1583
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,030
关于它，所以这也是期望，所以你可以在这里看这个方程
about it so this is also the expectation so can you look at this equation here

1584
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:44,040
关于它，所以这也是期望，所以你可以在这里看这个方程
so can you look at this equation here now and tell me how from this equation

1585
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:48,829
现在，告诉我如何从等式中获取对数，然后得到期望值
so can you look at this equation here now and tell me how from this equation

01:03:48,829 --> 01:03:52,010
现在，告诉我如何从等式中获取对数，然后得到期望值
now and tell me how from this equation when I take logs and then expectation I

1587
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:52,020
现在，告诉我如何从等式中获取对数，然后得到期望值
when I take logs and then expectation I get this equation from what did that

1588
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,319
从我认为假设是什么得出的等式
when I take logs and then expectation I get this equation from what did that

1589
01:03:54,319 --> 01:04:00,970
从我认为假设是什么得出的等式
get this equation from what did that come from I think the assumption is and

1590
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:00,980
从我认为假设是什么得出的等式
come from I think the assumption is and this nice equation with the transition

1591
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:04,730
这个很好的方程，具有向右边界过渡的概率，并且
come from I think the assumption is and this nice equation with the transition

1592
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:06,980
这个很好的方程，具有向右边界过渡的概率，并且
this nice equation with the transition probabilities to a boundary right and

1593
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:06,990
这个很好的方程，具有向右边界过渡的概率，并且
probabilities to a boundary right and you know we can do this the same thing

1594
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:09,260
你知道我们可以在那做同样的事情，但是我怎么得到语法
probabilities to a boundary right and you know we can do this the same thing

1595
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:12,500
你知道我们可以在那做同样的事情，但是我怎么得到语法
you know we can do this the same thing there but how how did I get a grammar

1596
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:12,510
你知道我们可以在那做同样的事情，但是我怎么得到语法
there but how how did I get a grammar there let's go to think of this now they

1597
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:14,630
现在让我们考虑一下，他们正在给Rama什么是0k
there but how how did I get a grammar there let's go to think of this now they

1598
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:21,920
现在让我们考虑一下，他们正在给Rama什么是0k
there let's go to think of this now they are giving Rama what is 0k

1599
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:43,720
这也是z1k的后验，所以他们怎么
there let's go to think of this now they are giving Rama what is 0k

1600
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:43,730
这也是z1k的后验，所以他们怎么


1601
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:52,400
这也是z1k的后验，所以他们怎么
this is also that is the posterior expectation of the z1k so how did they

1602
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:52,410
这也是z1k的后验，所以他们怎么
expectation of the z1k so how did they welcome this time to a gamma x level PK

1603
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:57,320
欢迎这次来到伽玛X级PK
expectation of the z1k so how did they welcome this time to a gamma x level PK

1604
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,810
记住，这个终端曾经是戏剧，仍然期望他们
expectation of the z1k so how did they welcome this time to a gamma x level PK

1605
01:04:58,810 --> 01:04:58,820
记住，这个终端曾经是戏剧，仍然期望他们


1606
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:05,690
记住，这个终端曾经是戏剧，仍然期望他们
remember this terminal used to be the drama still anticipate that their

1607
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:05,700
记住，这个终端曾经是戏剧，仍然期望他们
the drama still anticipate that their indicator function that 0 and K is equal

1608
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,540
0和K等于L的指标函数可以给您期望以及
the drama still anticipate that their indicator function that 0 and K is equal

1609
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:12,980
0和K等于L的指标函数可以给您期望以及
indicator function that 0 and K is equal to L can give you expectation and what

1610
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:12,990
0和K等于L的指标函数可以给您期望以及
to L can give you expectation and what is that the expectation is gamma Z 1 K

1611
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:15,800
是期望是伽玛Z 1 K，所以从
to L can give you expectation and what is that the expectation is gamma Z 1 K

1612
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:25,730
是期望是伽玛Z 1 K，所以从
is that the expectation is gamma Z 1 K so similarly this in the transition from

1613
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:25,740
是期望是伽玛Z 1 K，所以从
so similarly this in the transition from t minus 1 to 3 you will get basically

1614
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,900
t减去1到3，您将基本上得到这个量K，这就是电动机
so similarly this in the transition from t minus 1 to 3 you will get basically

1615
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,660
t减去1到3，您将基本上得到这个量K，这就是电动机
t minus 1 to 3 you will get basically this quantity K which is this motoring

1616
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:32,670
t减去1到3，您将基本上得到这个量K，这就是电动机
this quantity K which is this motoring joining posterior of z t minus 1 and t

1617
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:34,760
连接zt减1和t的后验，这实际上是什么
this quantity K which is this motoring joining posterior of z t minus 1 and t

1618
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,250
连接zt减1和t的后验，这实际上是什么
joining posterior of z t minus 1 and t so what is this actually

1619
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:37,260
连接zt减1和t的后验，这实际上是什么
so what is this actually this is expectation of what distribution

1620
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:42,170
这是好莱坞的预期分布
so what is this actually this is expectation of what distribution

1621
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:45,500
这是好莱坞的预期分布
this is expectation of what distribution and in the Hollywood

1622
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,860
这是城市的联合分布-朗德尔州a和城市是一个斑点
this is expectation of what distribution and in the Hollywood

1623
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:46,870
这是城市的联合分布-朗德尔州a和城市是一个斑点


1624
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:52,590
这是城市的联合分布-朗德尔州a和城市是一个斑点
this is the joint distribution of city - rondell states a and city being a speck

1625
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:52,600
这是城市的联合分布-朗德尔州a和城市是一个斑点
rondell states a and city being a speck a the proceeded expectation of that is

1626
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,290
对此的预期是Vista的数量T好的，因此养老金
rondell states a and city being a speck a the proceeded expectation of that is

1627
01:05:55,290 --> 01:06:03,300
对此的预期是Vista的数量T好的，因此养老金
a the proceeded expectation of that is Vista the quantity T okay so the pension

1628
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:03,310
对此的预期是Vista的数量T好的，因此养老金
Vista the quantity T okay so the pension is right but this van that we completed

1629
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:06,000
是正确的，但是我们完成了一次交换，我们将其定义为
Vista the quantity T okay so the pension is right but this van that we completed

1630
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,530
是正确的，但是我们完成了一次交换，我们将其定义为
is right but this van that we completed an exchange that we defined them as

1631
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:07,540
是正确的，但是我们完成了一次交换，我们将其定义为
an exchange that we defined them as posterior distributions all right this

1632
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:11,580
后分布好的，这就是我们如何定义它们的方式
an exchange that we defined them as posterior distributions all right this

1633
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:14,400
后分布好的，这就是我们如何定义它们的方式
posterior distributions all right this is how we define them okay this vectors

1634
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:14,410
后分布好的，这就是我们如何定义它们的方式
is how we define them okay this vectors because if he can take value 1

1635
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:17,490
因为如果他可以取值1，你知道我有不同的K状态
is how we define them okay this vectors because if he can take value 1

1636
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:19,860
因为如果他可以取值1，你知道我有不同的K状态
because if he can take value 1 you know I have different K State okay

1637
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:19,870
因为如果他可以取值1，你知道我有不同的K状态
you know I have different K State okay so when I simplify this and I'm asking

1638
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:23,190
所以当我简化这个，我问什么是祖母的GP k是
you know I have different K State okay so when I simplify this and I'm asking

1639
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:26,160
所以当我简化这个，我问什么是祖母的GP k是
so when I simplify this and I'm asking what is grandma's GP k yes that is the

1640
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:26,170
所以当我简化这个，我问什么是祖母的GP k是

is also the personal expectation of z TK similarly when I put this Z to minus 1 3

1644
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:35,160
类似地，当我将Z减为1 3和c TK时，是
is also the personal expectation of z TK similarly when I put this Z to minus 1 3

1645
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,450
类似地，当我将Z减为1 3和c TK时，是

1646
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:39,460
类似地，当我将Z减为1 3和c TK时，是
and c TK yes that is the probability for stated probability of city - Ron being

1647
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:42,510
陈述的城市概率-罗恩（Ron）说为J，而这个州在K状态，

1678
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:50,470
统计信息什么都没有，只有这个，然后再传给这个伽玛和这个
this before message this gamma and this so this is moving distribution basically

1679
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:53,190
所以这基本上是运动分布，ZT的关节后减-1
this before message this gamma and this so this is moving distribution basically

1680

so but at time t minus one among set among state J and then I transitional

1816
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:22,790
在状态J中，然后我将时间T过渡到状态k，所以这恰好是
among state J and then I transitional time T to state k so this is exactly

1817
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:22,800
在状态J中，然后我将时间T过渡到状态k，所以这恰好是
time T to state k so this is exactly what we had before the only difference

1818
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,280
我们之前所拥有的唯一区别是，该基因伽玛在​​我们的后
time T to state k so this is exactly what we had before the only difference

1819
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,459
我们之前所拥有的唯一区别是，该基因伽玛在​​我们的后
what we had before the only difference is that this gene gamma our posterior

1820
01:14:28,459 --> 01:14:28,469
我们之前所拥有的唯一区别是，该基因伽玛在​​我们的后
is that this gene gamma our posterior probabilities and there's nothing

1821
01:14:28,469 --> 01:14:31,670
概率，没有任何概率，因为这里要计算
is that this gene gamma our posterior probabilities and there's nothing

1822
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:34,490
概率，没有任何概率，因为这里要计算
probabilities and there's nothing probabilities because here to calculate

1823
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:34,500
