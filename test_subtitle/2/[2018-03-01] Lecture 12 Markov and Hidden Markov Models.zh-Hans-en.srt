00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:40,700
好吧，这1232年，所以让我们分开吧，我确定雨是
so let's part I am sure the rain is a factor on some not coming on time so

3
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:48,510
某些时间不准的因素，所以在这些讲座之后，我认为
so let's part I am sure the rain is a factor on some not coming on time so

4
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,240
某些时间不准的因素，所以在这些讲座之后，我认为
factor on some not coming on time so behind these lectures I thought that

5
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,250
某些时间不准的因素，所以在这些讲座之后，我认为
behind these lectures I thought that hidden Markov models will work them in

6
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,400
隐藏的马尔可夫模型将在过去使用它们，但至少基于问题
behind these lectures I thought that hidden Markov models will work them in

I have from two of you I don't know why some kind of having picked up lots of

11
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:03,740
我有两个人，我不知道为什么要捡起很多东西
some kind of having picked up lots of the ideas because we already cover the

12
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,320
这些想法，因为我们已经用hmm弥补了算法的损失，但是

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:08,950
这些想法，因为我们已经用hmm弥补了算法的损失，但是
loss of the algorithms with hmm but maybe you only pick up ideas after the

15
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,410
也许你只有在做完作业后才想到主意，我想你会认识你吗？

59
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,050
不管这种类型是通用的，然后您都必须做一些特别的事情
then you have to do something special about

60
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,379
关于提高上学期的参数
then you have to do something special about

61
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,230
关于提高上学期的参数
about raising the parameters of the last term

62
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:39,240
关于提高上学期的参数
raising the parameters of the last term okay simple statement serious you cannot

63
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:49,860
好吧，简单的声明，严重的是，您不能真正将Z集成出来，因为
raising the parameters of the last term okay simple statement serious you cannot

64
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,920
好吧，简单的声明，严重的是，您不能真正将Z集成出来，因为
okay simple statement serious you cannot really go and integrate Z out because

65
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:52,930
好吧，简单的声明，严重的是，您不能真正将Z集成出来，因为
really go and integrate Z out because that will require a massive calculation

66
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,559
这将需要大量的计算，因此您需要做的是
really go and integrate Z out because that will require a massive calculation

67
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:58,260
这将需要大量的计算，因此您需要做的是
that will require a massive calculation so what you need to do is you need to be

68
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,270
这将需要大量的计算，因此您需要做的是
so what you need to do is you need to be able to estimate the parameters with the

69
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,909
能够以估计的最大似然排序来估计参数
so what you need to do is you need to be able to estimate the parameters with the

00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,830
能够以估计的最大似然排序来估计参数
able to estimate the parameters with the maximum likelihood sort of an estimate

71
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
能够以估计的最大似然排序来估计参数
maximum likelihood sort of an estimate you need to work with their expectation

72
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,960
您需要使用他们的期望最大化算法，我知道我

73
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,369
您需要使用他们的期望最大化算法，我知道我
you need to work with their expectation maximization algorithm and I you know I

74
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:08,379
您需要使用他们的期望最大化算法，我知道我
maximization algorithm and I you know I provided the specifics for the case of

75
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:11,640
提供了嗯的情况的细节，但实际上是拳头在同一家
maximization algorithm and I you know I provided the specifics for the case of

76
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,580
提供了嗯的情况的细节，但实际上是拳头在同一家
provided the specifics for the case of hmm but really fist the same home where

77
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:14,590
提供了嗯的情况的细节，但实际上是拳头在同一家
hmm but really fist the same home where in in many other areas of machine

78
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,149
在机器学习的许多其他领域中，所以接下来与阿尔伯特重复
hmm but really fist the same home where in in many other areas of machine

79
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,279
在机器学习的许多其他领域中，所以接下来与阿尔伯特重复
in in many other areas of machine learning so next repeat with the Albert

80
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:20,289
在机器学习的许多其他领域中，所以接下来与阿尔伯特重复
learning so next repeat with the Albert looks like extra mass transfer next one

81
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:26,249
看起来像是多余的传质接下来，我们对X Capital TZ说：
learning so next repeat with the Albert looks like extra mass transfer next one

82
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:29,100
看起来像是多余的传质接下来，我们对X Capital TZ说：
looks like extra mass transfer next one let's say to X capital T Z are they

83
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,110
看起来像是多余的传质接下来，我们对X Capital TZ说：
let's say to X capital T Z are they affiliated latent variables we don't

84
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,899
关联的潜在变量，我们不知道他们是谁
let's say to X capital T Z are they affiliated latent variables we don't

85
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,610
关联的潜在变量，我们不知道他们是谁
affiliated latent variables we don't know what they are people of the

86
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:32,620
关联的潜在变量，我们不知道他们是谁
know what they are people of the parameters all right so whether it is

87
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,680
参数好，所以是否弱，这是联合的可能性
know what they are people of the parameters all right so whether it is

88
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,700
参数好，所以是否弱，这是联合的可能性
parameters all right so whether it is weak form this is the joint likelihood

89
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:37,710
参数好，所以是否弱，这是联合的可能性
weak form this is the joint likelihood usually the recipient of observations

90
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,040
通常是观察对象的接收者，所以很明显Z未被观察到，但是
weak form this is the joint likelihood usually the recipient of observations

91
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,200
通常是观察对象的接收者，所以很明显Z未被观察到，但是
usually the recipient of observations right so obviously Z is not observed but

92
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,210
通常是观察对象的接收者，所以很明显Z未被观察到，但是
right so obviously Z is not observed but this is the this distribution is written

93
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:54,959
这是该分布是作为函数编写的，并且发布了信息
right so obviously Z is not observed but this is the this distribution is written

94
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:14,070
这是该分布是作为函数编写的，并且发布了信息
this is the this distribution is written as a function and the posted information

95
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
这是该分布是作为函数编写的，并且发布了信息
as a function and the posted information variable Z it's also function of

96
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,529
变量Z也是参数的函数，所以我们要做的是创建一个
as a function and the posted information variable Z it's also function of

97
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:20,460
变量Z也是参数的函数，所以我们要做的是创建一个
variable Z it's also function of parameter so what we do is to create an

98
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,119
在以前的值上更新此值，这是对生命联合的期望
variable Z it's also function of parameter so what we do is to create an

99
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:26,129
在以前的值上更新此值，这是对生命联合的期望


100
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:31,920
在以前的值上更新此值，这是对生命联合的期望
update this on the previous values this is the expectation of the joint of life

101
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:31,930
在以前的值上更新此值，这是对生命联合的期望
is the expectation of the joint of life it will be respect to this posterior and

102
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,930
这将是关于这个后验的，期望步骤基本上是
is the expectation of the joint of life it will be respect to this posterior and

103
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,689
这将是关于这个后验的，期望步骤基本上是
it will be respect to this posterior and the expectation step is basically to

104
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:36,699
这将是关于这个后验的，期望步骤基本上是
the expectation step is basically to compute this whole term Q all right do

105
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,260
计算整个项Q可以进行计算，然后
the expectation step is basically to compute this whole term Q all right do

106
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,029
计算整个项Q可以进行计算，然后
compute this whole term Q all right do the calculations and then the

107
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:42,039
计算整个项Q可以进行计算，然后
the calculations and then the maximization is once we compute it

108
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:43,890
最大化是我们计算出的相对于theta和
the calculations and then the maximization is once we compute it

109
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,379
最大化是我们计算出的相对于theta和
maximization is once we compute it optimize it with respect to theta and

110
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:46,389
最大化是我们计算出的相对于theta和
optimize it with respect to theta and once we do that then you come back to

111
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:48,959
一旦我们做到了，那么您将回到第一步以完成此操作
optimize it with respect to theta and once we do that then you come back to

112
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,700
一旦我们做到了，那么您将回到第一步以完成此操作
once we do that then you come back to the first step to complete this with

113
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:50,710
一旦我们做到了，那么您将回到第一步以完成此操作
the first step to complete this with theta being taking now that all the

114
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,459
现在theta正在获取所有第五次幂，并再次更新theta
the first step to complete this with theta being taking now that all the

115
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:56,040
现在theta正在获取所有第五次幂，并再次更新theta
theta being taking now that all the fifth power all and again updating theta

116
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,050
现在theta正在获取所有第五次幂，并再次更新theta
fifth power all and again updating theta etcetera etcetera okay hmm in other

117
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:03,089
etcetera etcetera好吧，嗯，在其他地方，你会得到足够的不同
fifth power all and again updating theta etcetera etcetera okay hmm in other

118
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,070

place you will get different sufficient statistics the sufficient statistics

120
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,200
统计他们即将到来的足够的统计数据

00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:52,900
您也可以随时计算这个，所以我们不需要这个
well alright so we don't need this let me just go to review very fast I two

177
00:09:52,900 --> 00:10:00,180
我两天前去复习的速度非常快，所以当我总结时，我们必须
well alright so we don't need this let me just go to review very fast I two

178
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,830
我两天前去复习的速度非常快，所以当我总结时，我们必须
me just go to review very fast I two days ago so when I sum we have to

179
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:04,840
我两天前去复习的速度非常快，所以当我总结时，我们必须
days ago so when I sum we have to calculate one of Z T right zippy can

180
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,550
计算一个正确的ZT zippy可以取K值，所以我们实际上取它们
days ago so when I sum we have to calculate one of Z T right zippy can

181
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,060
计算一个正确的ZT zippy可以取K值，所以我们实际上取它们

182
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,070
计算一个正确的ZT zippy可以取K值，所以我们实际上取它们
take K values so we actually take them escape analysis to calculate one of ZT k

183
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,640
逸出分析以计算ZT k之一，所以你能告诉我这是神秘的吗

185
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,060
逸出分析以计算ZT k之一，所以你能告诉我这是神秘的吗
so can you tell me this is mystically so when I shall teach and a time indicator

186
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,560
当我教书时，时间指示器的保养是一个直接的指示器，那么什么是
so can you tell me this is mystically so when I shall teach and a time indicator

187
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,110
当我教书时，时间指示器的保养是一个直接的指示器，那么什么是
when I shall teach and a time indicator care is a straight indicator so what is

188
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,120
当我教书时，时间指示器的保养是一个直接的指示器，那么什么是
care is a straight indicator so what is very much city K so we know that we're

189
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,140
非常多的城市K，所以我们知道我们在谈论同样的事情
care is a straight indicator so what is very much city K so we know that we're

190
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,910
非常多的城市K，所以我们知道我们在谈论同样的事情
very much city K so we know that we're talking about the same things the

191
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:32,920
非常多的城市K，所以我们知道我们在谈论同样的事情
talking about the same things the probability is that

192
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,910
可能性是
talking about the same things the probability is that

193
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,830
所以凯撒的系统概率权是一个挑剔的移动分布
talking about the same things the probability is that

194
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:41,840
所以凯撒的系统概率权是一个挑剔的移动分布


195
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,540
所以凯撒的系统概率权是一个挑剔的移动分布
so the system probability right Caesar is a fastidious moving distribution

196
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:46,550
所以凯撒的系统概率权是一个挑剔的移动分布
is a fastidious moving distribution doesn't credit accounts so it what is

197
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,670
没有记入帐户，所以它是与衰变相对的伽玛，我提醒您
is a fastidious moving distribution doesn't credit accounts so it what is

198
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,519
没有记入帐户，所以它是与衰变相对的伽玛，我提醒您
doesn't credit accounts so it what is gamma opposite decay and I remind you

199
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:51,529
没有记入帐户，所以它是与衰变相对的伽玛，我提醒您
gamma opposite decay and I remind you again I kept no one to keep going back

200
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:53,050
再次，我没有人再回去花十分钟去做，所以这是
gamma opposite decay and I remind you again I kept no one to keep going back

201
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,240
再次，我没有人再回去花十分钟去做，所以这是
again I kept no one to keep going back to takes ten minutes to do so this is

202
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,250
再次，我没有人再回去花十分钟去做，所以这是
to takes ten minutes to do so this is the definition of the veteran CT gamma Z

203
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,550
老兵CT伽玛Z T的定义
to takes ten minutes to do so this is the definition of the veteran CT gamma Z

204
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,070
老兵CT伽玛Z T的定义
the definition of the veteran CT gamma Z T it's the post a diversity given all

205
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:00,080
老兵CT伽玛Z T的定义
T it's the post a diversity given all the data from time one to time capital T

206
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,380
从一次到一次的资本T的数据，所以当我把
T it's the post a diversity given all the data from time one to time capital T

207
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:09,310
从一次到一次的资本T的数据，所以当我把
the data from time one to time capital T so what this gram of ZT k when I put the

208
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:09,320
从一次到一次的资本T的数据，所以当我把
so what this gram of ZT k when I put the index there explicitly so this is a

209
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,260
在那里明确地索引，所以这是一个数字，不是向量，所以是什么
so what this gram of ZT k when I put the index there explicitly so this is a

210
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,860
在那里明确地索引，所以这是一个数字，不是向量，所以是什么
index there explicitly so this is a number is not a vector right so what is

211
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:14,870
在那里明确地索引，所以这是一个数字，不是向量，所以是什么
number is not a vector right so what is gamma of Z DK is the probability of

212
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,779
Z DK的伽玛是
number is not a vector right so what is gamma of Z DK is the probability of

213
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:39,320
因此，我们基本上将其发送给该机构，他们向他们派遣了西班牙的任务，而这
number is not a vector right so what is gamma of Z DK is the probability of

214
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,330
因此，我们基本上将其发送给该机构，他们向他们派遣了西班牙的任务，而这


215
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:45,510
因此，我们基本上将其发送给该机构，他们向他们派遣了西班牙的任务，而这
we sent it so basically this agency decay Spanish missions to them and this

216
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:45,520
因此，我们基本上将其发送给该机构，他们向他们派遣了西班牙的任务，而这
decay Spanish missions to them and this is the posterior probability that they

217
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,130
是他们接受值的后验概率，如果
decay Spanish missions to them and this is the posterior probability that they

218
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,860
是他们接受值的后验概率，如果
is the posterior probability that they will take the value up okay and if the

219
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:49,870
是他们接受值的后验概率，如果
will take the value up okay and if the values are 1 and 0 obviously this is the

220
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,710
值分别为1和0，这与ztk的期望值相同
will take the value up okay and if the values are 1 and 0 obviously this is the

221
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,800
值分别为1和0，这与ztk的期望值相同
values are 1 and 0 obviously this is the same is the expectation of ztk right

222
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,810
值分别为1和0，这与ztk的期望值相同
same is the expectation of ztk right because the expectation is the value at

223
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,900
因为期望值是x1乘以概率乘以另一个的值
same is the expectation of ztk right because the expectation is the value at

224
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,360
因为期望值是x1乘以概率乘以另一个的值
because the expectation is the value at x1 times the probability times the other

225
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:00,370
因为期望值是x1乘以概率乘以另一个的值
x1 times the probability times the other value 0 times the probability so it's

226
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,760
值是概率的0倍，所以它实际上等于
x1 times the probability times the other value 0 times the probability so it's

227
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,230
值是概率的0倍，所以它实际上等于
value 0 times the probability so it's really equal to the probability that

228
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,240
值是概率的0倍，所以它实际上等于
really equal to the probability that typically is equal to 1 what's the

229
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,450
通常等于1的后验概率是多少，当然您
really equal to the probability that typically is equal to 1 what's the

230
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,840
通常等于1的后验概率是多少，当然您
typically is equal to 1 what's the posterior probability and certainly you

231
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:09,850
通常等于1的后验概率是多少，当然您
posterior probability and certainly you can think this as this joint expectation

232
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:15,870
可以以一种非常相似的方式认为这是这种共同的期望
posterior probability and certainly you can think this as this joint expectation

233
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:24,690
可以以一种非常相似的方式认为这是这种共同的期望
can think this as this joint expectation in a very similar fashion from time that

234
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:24,700
可以以一种非常相似的方式认为这是这种共同的期望
in a very similar fashion from time that they wanted capital T all right so this

235
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,770
他们想要大写的T，所以这是我的大写X，我们要
in a very similar fashion from time that they wanted capital T all right so this

236
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,990
他们想要大写的T，所以这是我的大写X，我们要
they wanted capital T all right so this is my capital X and we're going to

237
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:31,000
他们想要大写的T，所以这是我的大写X，我们要
is my capital X and we're going to calculate this Q and when you remember

238
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,980
计算这个Q，当你记得丹尼是对联合的期望时
is my capital X and we're going to calculate this Q and when you remember

239
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,070
计算这个Q，当你记得丹尼是对联合的期望时
calculate this Q and when you remember Danny is the expectation of the joint of

240
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:38,080
计算这个Q，当你记得丹尼是对联合的期望时
Danny is the expectation of the joint of likelihood this is y so actually just

241
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,700
可能是y，所以实际上再次提醒我，这个伽玛是怎么来的
Danny is the expectation of the joint of likelihood this is y so actually just

242
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,950
可能是y，所以实际上再次提醒我，这个伽玛是怎么来的
likelihood this is y so actually just remind me again how did this gamma come

243
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:43,960
可能是y，所以实际上再次提醒我，这个伽玛是怎么来的

00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,070
想现在就开始，我给你个办法，好吧，关于那件事，
okay so about the only thing that changes the rest remains basically

this to an office and that's the trivial calculation so if you look at maybe

469
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,780
计算，因此，如果您看的是书本，甚至有人给您打电话
this to an office and that's the trivial calculation so if you look at maybe

some fire on a JK and base you can before if you remember what we did is we

478
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:32,520
如果您还记得我们所做的，那我们就让我发疯了可能性模型
some fire on a JK and base you can before if you remember what we did is we

479
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,460
如果您还记得我们所做的，那我们就让我发疯了可能性模型
before if you remember what we did is we started me crazy the likelihood model

480
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:35,470
如果您还记得我们所做的，那我们就让我发疯了可能性模型
started me crazy the likelihood model like that so now that you will base you

481
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,370
这样，您现在就可以拥有现代的可能性了
started me crazy the likelihood model like that so now that you will base you

这样，您现在就可以拥有现代的可能性了
like that so now that you will base you have the likelihood modern times the

483
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:40,900
这样，您现在就可以拥有现代的可能性了
have the likelihood modern times the probability law the parameters and then

484
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,960

对，所以今天我得到了马戏团小丑奥林匹克评论或


512
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:41,060
对，所以今天我得到了马戏团小丑奥林匹克评论或
right so today I have been given a circus clown Olympic review or the

513
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,070
对，所以今天我得到了马戏团小丑奥林匹克评论或

whether climate whatever this is have problems that you need on each of them

520
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:10,669
您每个人都需要的问题，所以我需要跨州访问，所以这是
whether climate whatever this is have problems that you need on each of them

521
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:39,769
您每个人都需要的问题，所以我需要跨州访问，所以这是
problems that you need on each of them so I need to interstate so this is

522
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:39,779
您每个人都需要的问题，所以我需要跨州访问，所以这是
so I need to interstate so this is what's called the filtering distribution

523
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:41,450
所谓的过滤分布
so I need to interstate so this is what's called the filtering distribution

524
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,549
所谓的过滤分布
what's called the filtering distribution so the anticipate that the filtering

525
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:43,559
所谓的过滤分布
so the anticipate that the filtering distribution would be noisy you won't be

526
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,979
分布会很嘈杂，您将无法精确估算，因为不知何故
so the anticipate that the filtering distribution would be noisy you won't be

527
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:50,060
分布会很嘈杂，您将无法精确估算，因为不知何故
distribution would be noisy you won't be able estimated precisely because somehow

528
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,070
分布会很嘈杂，您将无法精确估算，因为不知何故
able estimated precisely because somehow you just got some measurements on the

529
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,769
您刚刚对案例进行了一些测量，您知道您不会
able estimated precisely because somehow you just got some measurements on the

530
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,479
您刚刚对案例进行了一些测量，您知道您不会
you just got some measurements on the case ago you know you're not going to

531
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:53,489
您刚刚对案例进行了一些测量，您知道您不会
case ago you know you're not going to give the best estimates for this G of T

so expect this filtering distribution to be noise the smoothing distribution

535
00:22:57,899 --> 00:23:01,070
是噪声，实际上是我们给它定义的平滑分布
so expect this filtering distribution to be noise the smoothing distribution

536
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,979
是噪声，实际上是我们给它定义的平滑分布
be noise the smoothing distribution which we actually gives it to define

537
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:03,989
是噪声，实际上是我们给它定义的平滑分布
which we actually gives it to define this gamma messages okay is the

538
00:23:03,989 --> 00:23:08,019
这个伽马信息好了，是计算给定的小T的条件
which we actually gives it to define this gamma messages okay is the

所有返回资本T的数据都是平滑分布，因此
condition to compute the little T given all the data back to capital T this is

542
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:15,109
所有返回资本T的数据都是平滑分布，因此
all the data back to capital T this is the smoothing distribution so

543
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:15,119
所有返回资本T的数据都是平滑分布，因此
the smoothing distribution so effectively you use future data to do

544
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,099
有效地使用将来的数据在更早的时间进行估算，以便您知道

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,330
有效地使用将来的数据在更早的时间进行估算，以便您知道
estimation at earlier times so you know this is an effective organization if you

547
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,599
这是一个有效的组织，如果您喜欢在此目的地上的话，那么
estimation at earlier times so you know this is an effective organization if you

00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:30,079
这是一个有效的组织，如果您喜欢在此目的地上的话，那么
this is an effective organization if you like on the on on this destination so

549
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:30,089
这是一个有效的组织，如果您喜欢在此目的地上的话，那么
like on the on on this destination so you expect this distribution to be where

is mother than this distribution now this

553
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:37,729
这
is mother than this distribution now this

554
00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:40,110
并有奢侈地做，并在您想先做的任何时候给您估计
is mother than this distribution now this

555

and have the luxury to do and give estimation as anytime you want to first

557
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:44,380
并有奢侈地做，并在您想先做的任何时候给您估计
estimation as anytime you want to first you say yes to me now so that's the best

558
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,600
您现在对我说是，这是您可以做的最好的事情，所以这非常
estimation as anytime you want to first you say yes to me now so that's the best

559
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,190
您现在对我说是，这是您可以做的最好的事情，所以这非常
you say yes to me now so that's the best you can do okay so this is very much

560
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,200
您现在对我说是，这是您可以做的最好的事情，所以这非常
you can do okay so this is very much related sort of if you are going to do

561
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,020
相关的问题，如果你要做一个反问题，也许这是更多
you can do okay so this is very much related sort of if you are going to do

562
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,240
相关的问题，如果你要做一个反问题，也许这是更多
related sort of if you are going to do an inverse problem maybe this is more

563
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,250
相关的问题，如果你要做一个反问题，也许这是更多
an inverse problem maybe this is more related but if you do online estimation

564
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,180
相关，但如果您进行在线估算，则想知道在哪里导航
an inverse problem maybe this is more related but if you do online estimation

565
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,390
相关，但如果您进行在线估算，则想知道在哪里导航
related but if you do online estimation you want to know where to navigate about

566
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:03,400
相关，但如果您进行在线估算，则想知道在哪里导航
you want to know where to navigate about let you know you need to know the faith

567
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,600
让您知道您需要一直了解信仰圣经，因此这是
you want to know where to navigate about let you know you need to know the faith

568
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,850
让您知道您需要一直了解信仰圣经，因此这是
let you know you need to know the faith Testament all the time so this is the

569
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:08,860
让您知道您需要一直了解信仰圣经，因此这是
Testament all the time so this is the distribution interplay with obviously

570
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,710
显然，您知道可以进行一些平滑处理
Testament all the time so this is the distribution interplay with obviously

571
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,200
显然，您知道可以进行一些平滑处理
distribution interplay with obviously you know you can do some smoothing not

572
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,210
显然，您知道可以进行一些平滑处理
you know you can do some smoothing not that the state feedback of say P minus L

573
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,480
如果说P减去L的状态反馈，那么这是固定的更大的东西，如果
you know you can do some smoothing not that the state feedback of say P minus L

574
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,730
如果说P减去L的状态反馈，那么这是固定的更大的东西，如果
that the state feedback of say P minus L so this is the fixed large more thing if

575
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:20,740
如果说P减去L的状态反馈，那么这是固定的更大的东西，如果
so this is the fixed large more thing if you pixel so maybe at this time you can

576
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,210
您的像素，所以也许此时您可以获取先前估计的营养
so this is the fixed large more thing if you pixel so maybe at this time you can

577
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,540
您的像素，所以也许此时您可以获取先前估计的营养
you pixel so maybe at this time you can have the nutrient the previous estimates

578
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:27,550
您的像素，所以也许此时您可以获取先前估计的营养
have the nutrient the previous estimates all right this is this fixed large house

579
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,610
好吧，这是这座固定的大房子，你无能为力
have the nutrient the previous estimates all right this is this fixed large house

580
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,630
好吧，这是这座固定的大房子，你无能为力
all right this is this fixed large house nothing you can do predictions of what

581
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:33,640
好吧，这是这座固定的大房子，你无能为力
nothing you can do predictions of what the state is going to be next

582
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,180
状态将是下一个好吧，所以这就是这里
nothing you can do predictions of what the state is going to be next

583
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,440
状态将是下一个好吧，所以这就是这里
the state is going to be next all right so this is and here the simple

584
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:40,450
状态将是下一个好吧，所以这就是这里
all right so this is and here the simple calculation on how using the time of the

585
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,300
计算如何使用时间P的时间实际比
all right so this is and here the simple calculation on how using the time of the

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
计算前进的速度T现在，这实际上是唯一
now this is actually the only thing that you need to know to do this calculation

591
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,340
您需要知道执行此计算就是要知道此过滤分布

the algebra ok the risk you know there is really

605
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:16,720
代数确定，您知道确实存在的风险
ok the risk you know there is really nothing here so it's basically this

606
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,660
这里什么都没有，所以基本上是使用
ok the risk you know there is really nothing here so it's basically this

607
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,610
这里什么都没有，所以基本上是使用
nothing here so it's basically this calculation for dimensionalize with

608
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:20,620
这里什么都没有，所以基本上是使用
calculation for dimensionalize with respect to DT and DT plus 1 so you can

609
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,590
尊重DT和DT加号1，这样您就可以雀巢未来，但是您不会
calculation for dimensionalize with respect to DT and DT plus 1 so you can

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,010
时间T的收集日期，观察到某些需求的概率是多少？
probability of observing some need a part time T plus eight all right so you

624
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:59,520
兼职T加8没事，所以您可以把这辆出租汽车算作是对的
probability of observing some need a part time T plus eight all right so you

625
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,780
兼职T加8没事，所以您可以把这辆出租汽车算作是对的

兼职T加8没事，所以您可以把这辆出租汽车算作是对的
can figure this rental car as a right but based on the knowledge that you have

up to time T it tells you the probability of observing beta X at time

630
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:13,049
在时间T加h观测到βX的概率，所以这就是所谓的a
up to time T it tells you the probability of observing beta X at time

631
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:15,390
在时间T加h观测到βX的概率，所以这就是所谓的a

632
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:15,400
在时间T加h观测到βX的概率，所以这就是所谓的a
T plus h so this is what is called a posterior predictive dance that they are

1055
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:17,350
概率加上观察模型，所以这是一个比喻
probability plus the observation model and so so it's a parable más despacio

1056
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:17,360
概率加上观察模型，所以这是一个比喻
and so so it's a parable más despacio now there's masses past week and even

1057
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,760
现在有群众过去一周，甚至当我们做了交界处树

that they're discussing is more important than the message passing so

1063
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:34,460
比传递的信息重要，所以我要从一个不祥的话题开始
that they're discussing is more important than the message passing so

1064
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,810
比传递的信息重要，所以我要从一个不祥的话题开始

1238
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:28,040
更简单的方法是没有美好的一天，就像我们做的总结一样
will it look like we do the summation of the MS is too long again that's it okay

1239
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:35,450
MS又太长了，没关系
will it look like we do the summation of the MS is too long again that's it okay

that connects the two nights which is this times the evidenced and then we

1279
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:06,780
连接这两个夜晚，这是事实的证明，然后我们
this times the evidenced and then we took the message coming one more than

1280
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,690
收到的消息比剩下的先到达另一个音符多
this times the evidenced and then we took the message coming one more than

direction the message is coming at time T so actually lists exactly the same

1286
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,849
T所以当我们进行传播确定时，实际上列出了完全相同的方程式
direction the message is coming at time T so actually lists exactly the same

T所以当我们进行传播确定时，实际上列出了完全相同的方程式
equations when we did the propagation ok so there's nothing it's just what is

1289
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:25,900
所以什么都没有，那就是变化变小了
equations when we did the propagation ok so there's nothing it's just what is

1290
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:29,090
所以什么都没有，那就是变化变小了
so there's nothing it's just what is know is that the variation is down in

1291
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:29,100
所以什么都没有，那就是变化变小了
know is that the variation is down in this rise with an elementary caution

00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:06,799
因此，如果您想完成此操作，请在工作室使用此衣服移动接头，然后
clothes moving joint for studio and then you have to form a matrix between this

1304
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:09,400
你必须在这个标签和医生之间形成一个矩阵，所以基本上你
clothes moving joint for studio and then you have to form a matrix between this

知道这是缩短业务短缺的原因，让我们在Beta版中说一下
know this is shorten shortage of business let's say here in beta what's

1309
00:59:19,479 --> 00:59:19,489
知道这是缩短业务短缺的原因，让我们在Beta版中说一下
business let's say here in beta what's the vector okay metrics and then

1310
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:25,900
向量正常指标，然后基本上就可以了，所以所有这些事情
business let's say here in beta what's the vector okay metrics and then

1311
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:57,999

basically okay so all of these things are ready to go if you guys want to

1313
00:59:58,009 --> 01:00:00,099
准备好了，如果你们想对此进行编程，又一次您知道您

1316
01:00:04,009 --> 01:00:05,529
不喜欢这样，然后不管您有一个不错的级别化例程，
program this and again you know you don't like this and then whatever you

1317
01:00:05,529 --> 01:00:08,199
不喜欢这样，然后不管您有一个不错的级别化例程，

1318
01:00:08,199 --> 01:00:08,209
不喜欢这样，然后不管您有一个不错的级别化例程，
have a nice level ization routine and you say now normalize so if you means

1319
01:00:08,209 --> 01:00:10,829
您说现在归一化，所以如果您表示知道它错过了
have a nice level ization routine and you say now normalize so if you means

1320
01:00:10,829 --> 01:00:13,599
您说现在归一化，所以如果您表示知道它错过了

1321
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:13,609
您说现在归一化，所以如果您表示知道它错过了
you know it miss this evidence from the bottom and it's better not have to

1322

bother right keeping this track all the time so you miss it you just come and be

1325
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,939
时间，所以你想念它，你只是来成为正常的眼睛，实际上这会给
bother right keeping this track all the time so you miss it you just come and be

1326
01:00:18,939 --> 01:00:20,919
时间，所以你想念它，你只是来成为正常的眼睛，实际上这会给
time so you miss it you just come and be normal eyes and actually that will give

1327
01:00:20,919 --> 01:00:20,929
时间，所以你想念它，你只是来成为正常的眼睛，实际上这会给
normal eyes and actually that will give you immediately what that value of the

1328
01:00:20,929 --> 01:00:22,630
您立即发现证据的价值如何
normal eyes and actually that will give you immediately what that value of the

you immediately what that value of the evidence all right

1330
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:28,130
您立即发现证据的价值如何
evidence all right so basically we use this to compute the

1331
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:31,240
所以基本上我们用它来计算当我们
evidence all right so basically we use this to compute the

1332
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:36,079
所以基本上我们用它来计算当我们
so basically we use this to compute the the sufficient statistics in in when we

1333
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:36,089
所以基本上我们用它来计算当我们
the sufficient statistics in in when we did the you know the EMR growth since I

1334
01:00:36,089 --> 01:00:48,650
自从我提到维特比问题以来，您是否知道EMR的增长，所以让我
