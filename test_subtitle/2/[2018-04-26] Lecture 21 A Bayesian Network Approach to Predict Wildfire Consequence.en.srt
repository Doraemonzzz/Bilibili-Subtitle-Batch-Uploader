1
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:12,900
okay okay I become the first person to give presentation today hello everyone

2
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,850
give presentation today hello everyone my name is Tina I'm the first year

3
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,070
my name is Tina I'm the first year graduate student in the department

4
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,560
graduate student in the department working with environmental combustion

5
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,230
working with environmental combustion yes destroyed I'm experimental people

6
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,230
yes destroyed I'm experimental people and majority of my previous research and

7
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,750
and majority of my previous research and ongoing job are related to experiment

8
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,300
ongoing job are related to experiment instead of computation so this causes

9
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,250
instead of computation so this causes the most challenging class I've ever

10
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,030
the most challenging class I've ever taken but do I have to do I'm very

11
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,820
taken but do I have to do I'm very interested in that and we definitely

12
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,430
interested in that and we definitely know a lot although sometimes we are

13
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,199
know a lot although sometimes we are they take pressure and for my present

14
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,080
they take pressure and for my present for my future I just like a candle is

15
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,070
for my future I just like a candle is the topic which I want to try if you

16
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,320
the topic which I want to try if you want to apply what we've learned class

17
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,620
want to apply what we've learned class to a real world case which is using the

18
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,870
to a real world case which is using the Bayesian network approaches to predict

19
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,620
Bayesian network approaches to predict the well fire consequence

20
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,330
the well fire consequence well fire we generate some some damage

21
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,910
well fire we generate some some damage and you lead to some cost if you are

22
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,120
and you lead to some cost if you are person working maybe government

23
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,699
person working maybe government department when there is a well fire you

24
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,550
department when there is a well fire you will be probably surrounded by a lot of

25
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,000
will be probably surrounded by a lot of people from different media keep asking

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,039
people from different media keep asking you unknowing questions about the

27
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,610
you unknowing questions about the consequence of the well fire do you want

28
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,449
consequence of the well fire do you want to be complete - good job you have to

29
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,940
to be complete - good job you have to keep them down raise doubt the the

30
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,400
keep them down raise doubt the the consequence of the world fire however a

31
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,740
consequence of the world fire however a true value is accountant of the welfare

32
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,500
true value is accountant of the welfare it's kind of hard job because it's

33
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,080
it's kind of hard job because it's information from many different areas

34
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,069
information from many different areas for example you have to think about the

35
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,470
for example you have to think about the type of your city and you the road

36
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,720
type of your city and you the road density and your type of your

37
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,280
density and your type of your construction it's a kind of knowledge

38
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,650
construction it's a kind of knowledge from stable engineering and the

39
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,140
from stable engineering and the landscape environment something related

40
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,949
landscape environment something related to geology or biology and the value of

41
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,150
to geology or biology and the value of your building

42
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,820
your building finish their job of Business School so

43
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,620
finish their job of Business School so your word complex and hard and it keeps

44
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,570
your word complex and hard and it keeps the nightmares who the traditional

45
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,630
the nightmares who the traditional myself to calculate the counts quest

46
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,660
myself to calculate the counts quest however the Bayesian network or hurdle

47
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,210
however the Bayesian network or hurdle can depend on the information from

48
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,730
can depend on the information from different area very well as same time

49
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,060
different area very well as same time and there are many researchers using

50
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,990
and there are many researchers using Bayesian network to do some work on

51
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,930
Bayesian network to do some work on different areas for example the biology

52
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,520
different areas for example the biology system and you know well fire and this

53
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,050
system and you know well fire and this person whose name is I don't know his

54
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,740
person whose name is I don't know his name the correct pronunciation he

55
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,860
name the correct pronunciation he develop up internet work and the user to

56
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,860
develop up internet work and the user to access the suicide the building damage

57
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,250
access the suicide the building damage called the cost to buy well fire in

58
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:06,850
called the cost to buy well fire in tableau and in his work he just used use

59
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,550
tableau and in his work he just used use the software commercial software named

60
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,090
the software commercial software named fusion mister very strong software you

61
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,700
fusion mister very strong software you can't or actually tore your Bayesian

62
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,060
can't or actually tore your Bayesian network and that's the input your CPT

63
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,580
network and that's the input your CPT and click run and you will get your

64
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,470
and click run and you will get your result not very simple but he might I'm

65
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,500
result not very simple but he might I'm worried the interest in his job and want

66
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,680
worried the interest in his job and want to want to reproduce his work to a

67
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,370
to want to reproduce his work to a similar work but I don't want to use

68
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,300
similar work but I don't want to use commercial software and I want to use

69
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,820
commercial software and I want to use that want to view so busy a network in

70
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,070
that want to view so busy a network in MATLAB and to select several inference

71
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:51,760
MATLAB and to select several inference engines and try to see what I can get to

72
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,909
engines and try to see what I can get to decide or a silent

73
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,820
decide or a silent limit theory and see and is very large

74
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,580
limit theory and see and is very large and the wire here for you to study the

75
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,690
and the wire here for you to study the whole island I spend time and to as

76
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,260
whole island I spend time and to as is also similar in my work we just

77
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,920
is also similar in my work we just separate this island into several into

78
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,130
separate this island into several into thousands of a hotel and so each time we

79
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,370
thousands of a hotel and so each time we just the focus on one wire cells which

80
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,650
just the focus on one wire cells which is represented by the right square in

81
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,210
is represented by the right square in the in the matter and it has blood has

82
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,950
the in the matter and it has blood has the area of one of one kilometer square

83
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,250
the area of one of one kilometer square now we decided our aim just tells the

84
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,310
now we decided our aim just tells the next step we try to figure out one way

85
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,440
next step we try to figure out one way to quantify all the consequences of well

86
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,740
to quantify all the consequences of well fire several researchers has established

87
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,970
fire several researchers has established this constants which indicate that the a

88
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,750
this constants which indicate that the a good way to formular the expected value

89
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,950
good way to formular the expected value of the of the well fire is this function

90
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,370
of the of the well fire is this function and this one lifetime size expected

91
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,750
and this one lifetime size expected value may be the little value and leave

92
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,390
value may be the little value and leave the function of probability of hazard

93
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,910
the function of probability of hazard and the probability of damage

94
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,470
and the probability of damage conditional hazard and here and fiercely

95
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:18,720
conditional hazard and here and fiercely cost function and so last weekend we

96
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,240
cost function and so last weekend we know this formula we've got some hint to

97
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,230
know this formula we've got some hint to to think to consider the indicator to to

98
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,110
to think to consider the indicator to to consider the the way to comic-con

99
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,950
consider the the way to comic-con calculates are a consequence the next

100
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,350
calculates are a consequence the next that we tried to find indicator

101
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:41,220
that we tried to find indicator represent either the damage etc let's

102
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,850
represent either the damage etc let's come back to the little cells again and

103
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,970
come back to the little cells again and no judge nor no no are now uncle in job

104
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,720
no judge nor no no are now uncle in job is to find the indicators even if in the

105
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,730
is to find the indicators even if in the little cell they are still a lot of

106
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,010
little cell they are still a lot of indicator you have to think about for

107
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,250
indicator you have to think about for example we assume that the Hatters to be

108
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,420
example we assume that the Hatters to be the burn area and fire intensity and

109
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,320
the burn area and fire intensity and zero several and the earth

110
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,809
zero several and the earth something influenced your damage maybe

111
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:11,409
something influenced your damage maybe for example your your building type if

112
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:15,670
for example your your building type if it is the apartment or it's a single

113
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,059
it is the apartment or it's a single building and the how many building in

114
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:21,249
building and the how many building in this location the building density and

115
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:24,820
this location the building density and at same times your distance to the fire

116
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,140
at same times your distance to the fire station and the road surround you

117
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,490
station and the road surround you maybe maybe also maybe play a role in

118
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,519
maybe maybe also maybe play a role in strife because love did not decide that

119
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,380
strife because love did not decide that your chance to get help from fire

120
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,480
your chance to get help from fire department if you have a better chance

121
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,969
department if you have a better chance to find a chance to control the wealth

122
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,360
to find a chance to control the wealth but also fire not will definitely reduce

123
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,560
but also fire not will definitely reduce your cost

124
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,870
your cost so this speaker just gave me something

125
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,930
so this speaker just gave me something give us some hint about how to fuse the

126
00:08:52,930 --> 00:09:00,009
give us some hint about how to fuse the classic model so what watch the

127
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:03,250
classic model so what watch the indicator we want to study we can create

128
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,370
indicator we want to study we can create these weak raises to act involve graphic

129
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,360
these weak raises to act involve graphic model like this and to be honest the

130
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,329
model like this and to be honest the several indicator has been already

131
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:15,970
several indicator has been already ignored sense we only want to study

132
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,710
ignored sense we only want to study something we are really really

133
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,189
something we are really really interested and it's very hard for you to

134
00:09:21,189 --> 00:09:25,480
interested and it's very hard for you to study piracy in the to build everything

135
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,380
study piracy in the to build everything in a bottle and on the top the while

136
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,350
in a bottle and on the top the while each node represents the the hazard

137
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,420
each node represents the the hazard which is the burn area and fire

138
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,389
which is the burn area and fire intensity so little at least a light

139
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:42,189
intensity so little at least a light green nodes representing the item at at

140
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:46,569
green nodes representing the item at at the item at risk with this list we call

141
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:49,509
the item at risk with this list we call it Explorer this knows where you cost

142
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:52,580
it Explorer this knows where you cost your damage after your building and you

143
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:58,190
your damage after your building and you their major cost so unless we get to our

144
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,640
their major cost so unless we get to our model the next stop is to connect up to

145
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,880
model the next stop is to connect up to find the conditional probability

146
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,630
find the conditional probability distribution and and here we do another

147
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,270
distribution and and here we do another another assumption that we assume each

148
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:16,220
another assumption that we assume each node has finite state and and we assume

149
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,510
node has finite state and and we assume I also assume that the North follows of

150
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,920
I also assume that the North follows of discrete distributed instead of causing

151
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,300
discrete distributed instead of causing distributor also just get this value as

152
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,910
distributor also just get this value as this probability distribution value from

153
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,280
this probability distribution value from some literature research government

154
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,000
some literature research government report or historical record just like

155
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,960
report or historical record just like it's a mic so chose I chose here however

156
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,260
it's a mic so chose I chose here however unfortunately those data I know it's

157
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,320
unfortunately those data I know it's very important but this data is now

158
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,650
very important but this data is now we're not given in the paper that gave

159
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,720
we're not given in the paper that gave me an admirer to compete to do to

160
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,990
me an admirer to compete to do to continue so and forced us to do some

161
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,630
continue so and forced us to do some simplification and do some assumptions

162
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:05,790
simplification and do some assumptions and try to take this hope

163
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:05,800


164
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:13,619
here here let's come back to the graphic model again and and now we have to

165
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:16,199
model again and and now we have to everything ourselves first I want to do

166
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:19,139
everything ourselves first I want to do some simplification for this graphical

167
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,669
some simplification for this graphical model if you example when you when you

168
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:26,249
model if you example when you when you see when you're deciding and we will

169
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:28,679
see when you're deciding and we will decide that is prefigured probability or

170
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,109
decide that is prefigured probability or for the building damage you can see that

171
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:34,410
for the building damage you can see that it has swore parent 1 2 3 4 which I'm

172
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,479
it has swore parent 1 2 3 4 which I'm the each parent has different state

173
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:39,030
the each parent has different state which means that that if you want to

174
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,829
which means that that if you want to create a table that will be a really

175
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:43,289
create a table that will be a really huge large table you have to input a lot

176
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:46,619
huge large table you have to input a lot of data and you are you are under high

177
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:50,039
of data and you are you are under high risk to make mistake and actually I made

178
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,419
risk to make mistake and actually I made that and but interesting you go to his

179
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:57,509
that and but interesting you go to his paper and check that the beauty talk and

180
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,369
paper and check that the beauty talk and the contraction has almost similar

181
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:04,919
the contraction has almost similar similar meanings so for simple to

182
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,720
similar meanings so for simple to simplify this this model I just combine

183
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,100
simplify this this model I just combine them together combined together and then

184
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,039
them together combined together and then assume that the the Firewise know I'll

185
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,769
assume that the the Firewise know I'll have three states inside and the yellow

186
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:27,289
have three states inside and the yellow node has toothpaste inside so that's

187
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,869
node has toothpaste inside so that's fair enough but and not gave me a

188
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:36,239
fair enough but and not gave me a nightmare to defy the cpt and also the

189
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:38,429
nightmare to defy the cpt and also the earth and independence assumption to

190
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:42,900
earth and independence assumption to simplify or chair or so okay like that

191
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,350
simplify or chair or so okay like that KB here's a very example is a very

192
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,829
KB here's a very example is a very simple example for one for CPT for the

193
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:51,659
simple example for one for CPT for the positional

194
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:54,090
positional this is a fire suppression and it has

195
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,730
this is a fire suppression and it has three parents and fire intensity this by

196
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,519
three parents and fire intensity this by real health I define it as three states

197
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,429
real health I define it as three states and this too has has to stay inside so

198
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:06,370
and this too has has to stay inside so you

199
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:12,970
buuuut this table you can sleep on the consider different states of different

200
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,780
consider different states of different parents and each island each elements in

201
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,520
parents and each island each elements in the table I just gave our reasonable

202
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,760
the table I just gave our reasonable reasonable cats for the probability the

203
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,190
reasonable cats for the probability the the meaning of reasonable is that for

204
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,930
the meaning of reasonable is that for example if you have a really low fire

205
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,630
example if you have a really low fire intensity and your building is wearing

206
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,120
intensity and your building is wearing the buildings very close to the fire

207
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,570
the buildings very close to the fire station and you are surrounded by really

208
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,180
station and you are surrounded by really at once the vault system which means to

209
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,000
at once the vault system which means to the role density is very high you will

210
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,670
the role density is very high you will fight you will get better care better

211
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,220
fight you will get better care better health from the fire department which

212
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,820
health from the fire department which means that the fire control could be

213
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,030
means that the fire control could be successful or medium instead of poor so

214
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,640
successful or medium instead of poor so for example this case I just gave the

215
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,250
for example this case I just gave the poor poor can the four states has a

216
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,740
poor poor can the four states has a really low I give him a really low

217
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,380
really low I give him a really low probability and gave the medians control

218
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,350
probability and gave the medians control and successful control a really high

219
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:11,770
and successful control a really high probability so now we built our or

220
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,240
probability so now we built our or graphic model and also also have our

221
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,740
graphic model and also also have our probability distribution table for each

222
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,760
probability distribution table for each note the next stop Ahmet life is to make

223
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,910
note the next stop Ahmet life is to make all the inference engine here in this

224
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,900
all the inference engine here in this problem which 408 y31 see the first line

225
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,600
problem which 408 y31 see the first line is the junction tree an inference engine

226
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,730
is the junction tree an inference engine and neither one has to be belief

227
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,820
and neither one has to be belief propagation engine we have talked a lot

228
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,400
propagation engine we have talked a lot in the class and the tribe test allows

229
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,890
in the class and the tribe test allows in the homework so I won't discuss this

230
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,260
in the homework so I won't discuss this too much there and there is another

231
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,890
too much there and there is another little bit detention to use to use

232
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,350
little bit detention to use to use sampling engine called likelihood

233
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,500
sampling engine called likelihood waiting standpoint hinging

234
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,810
waiting standpoint hinging so it's a kind of temporal inking the

235
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,000
so it's a kind of temporal inking the basic idea of sample engines are you

236
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,060
basic idea of sample engines are you just the cheapest and whole handle turns

237
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,540
just the cheapest and whole handle turns they're from your from your Bayesian

238
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,150
they're from your from your Bayesian network and to compute the probability

239
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,980
network and to compute the probability of this temple computer ancient temple

240
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,380
of this temple computer ancient temple Allah keeps temple in now if you get

241
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,050
Allah keeps temple in now if you get enough sample the final distribution of

242
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,020
enough sample the final distribution of your sampling would be close to the true

243
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,810
your sampling would be close to the true distribution that's a basic idea of

244
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:27,010
distribution that's a basic idea of sampling and likelihood likelihood

245
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,770
sampling and likelihood likelihood waiting sampling is done it will be

246
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,640
waiting sampling is done it will be updated sampling work it's just we have

247
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,160
updated sampling work it's just we have the evidence and it takes to have this

248
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,640
the evidence and it takes to have this variable and only sample the one above

249
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,130
variable and only sample the one above is a wearable variables not related to

250
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,220
is a wearable variables not related to the average not only samples and man

251
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,660
the average not only samples and man evidence variables and for each sample

252
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,560
evidence variables and for each sample we just multiply it by the weight which

253
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,910
we just multiply it by the weight which is fine I've used a lot of literature's

254
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,400
is fine I've used a lot of literature's talk about the likelihood waiting

255
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,200
talk about the likelihood waiting waiting waiting waiting inference and

256
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,030
waiting waiting waiting inference and the sums up term are very complicated

257
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,270
the sums up term are very complicated and contain a lot of information here I

258
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,390
and contain a lot of information here I adjust the last day introduced by using

259
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:18,940
adjust the last day introduced by using a simple simple example let's come back

260
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,770
a simple simple example let's come back our cream-coloured sprinkler model we

261
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,330
our cream-coloured sprinkler model we are which we are worried familiar waste

262
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,350
are which we are worried familiar waste so and assume that we are required to

263
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,680
so and assume that we are required to compute the probability of R of R which

264
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,440
compute the probability of R of R which is ring given as is true that cream

265
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,630
is ring given as is true that cream color is 2 and the white grass is true

266
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,650
color is 2 and the white grass is true and let's start or simply first wish you

267
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:46,300
and let's start or simply first wish you the simple see the quality there is no

268
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,090
the simple see the quality there is no country and say we just assume that we

269
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,830
country and say we just assume that we can call it as true which please

270
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,660
can call it as true which please what which is plastic

271
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,840
what which is plastic and the sense this wife's decide when we

272
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,540
and the sense this wife's decide when we will next with simple the simple sighs

273
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,930
will next with simple the simple sighs so since whiskey style we have we can

274
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,720
so since whiskey style we have we can only offer to like our eyes from this

275
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,600
only offer to like our eyes from this right back however the ice is thick by

276
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,510
right back however the ice is thick by the evidence which is true so we can

277
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,510
the evidence which is true so we can only strike the wider of point one then

278
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,090
only strike the wider of point one then because our first weight of point one

279
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:28,040
because our first weight of point one and then come to our instance tastes

280
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,670
and then come to our instance tastes simple which is part so we can only like

281
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,230
simple which is part so we can only like our values from this bar right box and

282
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,860
our values from this bar right box and and there is no constraint on heart

283
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,360
and there is no constraint on heart which means that we can send off

284
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,620
which means that we can send off whatever we want

285
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,130
whatever we want let's assume that with simple art is

286
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:50,320
let's assume that with simple art is true are true and then we move to

287
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,840
true are true and then we move to example the table and says the our eyes

288
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,300
example the table and says the our eyes way is for that to be true

289
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,470
way is for that to be true our is sample to be true and come back

290
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,550
our is sample to be true and come back to the evidence we record W to be true

291
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,660
to the evidence we record W to be true so because the table can be only only it

292
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,120
so because the table can be only only it can be only in 9.99

293
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,880
can be only in 9.99 and we caught another way finally our

294
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,750
and we caught another way finally our total weight is 0.1 multiplied 199 which

295
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,660
total weight is 0.1 multiplied 199 which is 0.09 tonight and we just just

296
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,820
is 0.09 tonight and we just just multiplied and just multiply our sample

297
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,080
multiplied and just multiply our sample with this is our sample by this weight

298
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,310
with this is our sample by this weight and then to a lot of iterations to trim

299
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,830
and then to a lot of iterations to trim your job and finally the cat's a result

300
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,290
your job and finally the cat's a result of the final of probability and catch

301
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,220
of the final of probability and catch this one there is some problem of

302
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,080
this one there is some problem of likelihood waiting for example if you

303
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,410
likelihood waiting for example if you are required to compute probability of T

304
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,200
are required to compute probability of T given I signed the are you are what

305
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,010
given I signed the are you are what you're worried you can maybe sometimes

306
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,070
you're worried you can maybe sometimes thousands thousands go well with

307
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,600
thousands thousands go well with evidence

308
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,690
evidence sans use the the U star U star sample

309
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,049
sans use the the U star U star sample its sample to see here you don't need to

310
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:09,220
its sample to see here you don't need to think about the as your evidence which

311
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,330
think about the as your evidence which is a silent awfully oh yeah there's some

312
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,250
is a silent awfully oh yeah there's some opted for the sampling for under some

313
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,710
opted for the sampling for under some some other sampling changings to fix it

314
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,779
some other sampling changings to fix it problem which I won't talk here here's

315
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:28,509
problem which I won't talk here here's the result I got from the my life and

316
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:31,720
the result I got from the my life and this this part on the left-hand side I

317
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,299
this this part on the left-hand side I just the picture burn I rare to be zero

318
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,570
just the picture burn I rare to be zero point zero two zero point zero one

319
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,299
point zero two zero point zero one kilometer square and the changing the

320
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:42,519
kilometer square and the changing the fire intensity the actual painting

321
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,200
fire intensity the actual painting change for the cost or the cost that's

322
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,340
change for the cost or the cost that's because I assume last things as a higher

323
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,440
because I assume last things as a higher in fire intensity has a really really

324
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,299
in fire intensity has a really really low very low probabilities and this part

325
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:01,840
low very low probabilities and this part on the right hand side I just fix the

326
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,169
on the right hand side I just fix the fire intensity to be this one and the

327
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:08,009
fire intensity to be this one and the changing the upper area artist showed

328
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:12,490
changing the upper area artist showed generally those increasing trend as a

329
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,500
generally those increasing trend as a function of burn area that makes the

330
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,320
function of burn area that makes the instance if you have a fire intensity

331
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,529
instance if you have a fire intensity and have a larger burn area your result

332
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:22,990
and have a larger burn area your result would be a little your cost will be a

333
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:27,009
would be a little your cost will be a little bit large and this poll also

334
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:29,919
little bit large and this poll also showed the photos do something for

335
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,810
showed the photos do something for different inference engines that we know

336
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,909
different inference engines that we know the junction Creek and of accurate

337
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:37,120
the junction Creek and of accurate changing and the PD publication and

338
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,129
changing and the PD publication and likely who waiting proximate engines you

339
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:44,139
likely who waiting proximate engines you can see that for this case the chance to

340
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:46,960
can see that for this case the chance to be worthwhile where we always compared

341
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,970
be worthwhile where we always compared to the junction you know the belief

342
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,100
to the junction you know the belief complication works very well and there's

343
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,270
complication works very well and there's some

344
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,570
some different but between the likely who to

345
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,550
different but between the likely who to the junction tree and this one belief

346
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,440
the junction tree and this one belief propagation works also worried well but

347
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,470
propagation works also worried well but except here okay

348
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,770
except here okay the beautiful tools to the similar work

349
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,190
the beautiful tools to the similar work Prada but all the thousands of cells in

350
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,680
Prada but all the thousands of cells in on the island you can end up with this

351
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,590
on the island you can end up with this damaged custom at might even to learn in

352
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,010
damaged custom at might even to learn in the project they also just separates

353
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,490
the project they also just separates this island to nine thousand little

354
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,460
this island to nine thousand little cells though I don't have enough time to

355
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,440
cells though I don't have enough time to do Irish to do Irish a for the whole

356
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,480
do Irish to do Irish a for the whole island so this one just give you our

357
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,920
island so this one just give you our hints about the final result which and

358
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,290
hints about the final result which and there are some other thing we can talk

359
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,380
there are some other thing we can talk and the quality of trembling as a

360
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,100
and the quality of trembling as a function of number of your sample so you

361
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,340
function of number of your sample so you can see that the likelihood luckily

362
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,710
can see that the likelihood luckily who's awaiting awaiting inference

363
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,730
who's awaiting awaiting inference engines results come close to the

364
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,290
engines results come close to the junction sweet results the difference

365
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,720
junction sweet results the difference please the petite the appropriate a

366
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,730
please the petite the appropriate a difference that means the difference

367
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,070
difference that means the difference between junction tree and likelihood

368
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,190
between junction tree and likelihood reading so if you increase your number

369
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,530
reading so if you increase your number of sampling you will reduce the

370
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,630
of sampling you will reduce the difference which means the likelihood

371
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:12,100
difference which means the likelihood close to the close to the junction tree

372
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,430
close to the close to the junction tree however there is no freelance and if you

373
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,870
however there is no freelance and if you increase your number of increase your

374
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,050
increase your number of increase your time okay okay

375
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,570
time okay okay future world some future work definitely

376
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,510
future world some future work definitely for the work of this welfare study you

377
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,400
for the work of this welfare study you can definitely add more information more

378
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,770
can definitely add more information more cost more nodes and each note you can

379
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,260
cost more nodes and each note you can separate into more space that will

380
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,240
separate into more space that will definitely increase your accuracy of

381
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,810
definitely increase your accuracy of your approximation and I also think

382
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,740
your approximation and I also think about think about the for my own

383
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,260
about think about the for my own research also think about one way I can

384
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,990
research also think about one way I can maybe who I can I can apply what I've

385
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,450
maybe who I can I can apply what I've learned in this cost in my research

386
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,720
learned in this cost in my research to do some more uncertainty vacation for

387
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,090
to do some more uncertainty vacation for my experiments that would be interesting

388
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,360
my experiments that would be interesting to conclude today's presentation first

389
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,600
to conclude today's presentation first inquiry simple project is a single topic

390
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,640
inquiry simple project is a single topic compared to you guys may be busy Network

391
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,960
compared to you guys may be busy Network definitely really strong for in which

392
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,860
definitely really strong for in which you can use to you to evaluate the fire

393
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,040
you can use to you to evaluate the fire well fire consequence and I'm also think

394
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,530
well fire consequence and I'm also think about one way to apply it to my own

395
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,680
about one way to apply it to my own research and the advantage of busy and

396
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,140
research and the advantage of busy and network is is ability to power

397
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,050
network is is ability to power information from different area parties

398
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,420
information from different area parties to worry computational expense if you

399
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,220
to worry computational expense if you build a really large piece their network

400
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,430
build a really large piece their network and create you have also you need to do

401
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:40,270
and create you have also you need to do a lot of work to find the apt and since

402
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,580
a lot of work to find the apt and since the separatists are known for this for

403
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,760
the separatists are known for this for the other didn't give me in the paper we

404
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,740
the other didn't give me in the paper we can now compute our result with the with

405
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,520
can now compute our result with the with the authors cave without and and another

406
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,720
the authors cave without and and another two chances I act exact approximation

407
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,070
two chances I act exact approximation this exact approach and another to

408
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:08,500
this exact approach and another to proximate approaches and

409
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:08,510


410
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:26,440
[Applause]

411
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:26,450


412
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:38,520
yeah yeah

413
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:38,530


414
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:50,440
[Music]

415
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:50,450


416
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,139
Oh

417
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:54,149


418
00:24:54,149 --> 00:25:00,169
so he asked me where's the most the computation who explains the part for

419
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:05,899
computation who explains the part for the junction tree to compute I think

420
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:10,519
the junction tree to compute I think that the I don't know no score exactly I

421
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,829
that the I don't know no score exactly I think if my answer is salad maybe in the

422
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:15,499
think if my answer is salad maybe in the junction tree you have to we run the

423
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:19,699
junction tree you have to we run the code you have to find the optimize the

424
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:22,699
code you have to find the optimize the biased junction tree for the birthday

425
00:25:22,699 --> 00:25:26,389
biased junction tree for the birthday for your model so maybe that will be

426
00:25:26,389 --> 00:25:28,789
for your model so maybe that will be called sometime or it is computationally

427
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:38,259
called sometime or it is computationally expensive

428
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:38,269


429
00:25:38,269 --> 00:26:48,040
I didn't I didn't do that deeply here

430
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,050


431
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:56,530
I'm a second year student in galactic convenience I'm in possession and today

432
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:00,710
convenience I'm in possession and today my turn project linear time algorithm in

433
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:24,010
my turn project linear time algorithm in Bayesian email engine based on Gaussian

434
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:24,020


435
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:30,980
Deltora is animating noisy I really have two steps first is the hopper parameter

436
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:37,250
two steps first is the hopper parameter estimation by yeah matters

437
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:37,260


438
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:43,320
expectation maximization and second that will be the image restoration by an AP

439
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:55,160
will be the image restoration by an AP maximize a posterior metric and in this

440
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,170


441
00:27:55,170 --> 00:28:02,820
those things change that requires inverse of environment variance matrix

442
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:11,120
inverse of environment variance matrix the computation under order of natives

443
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,650
the computation under order of natives order of Ernie blogging I need this

444
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:22,750
order of Ernie blogging I need this people achieve

445
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:22,760


446
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:28,960
the reason why is because virtually having related to what we can learn

447
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,310
having related to what we can learn about the past like GM adoption my

448
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:44,530
about the past like GM adoption my father and intimidation laughter and

449
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,169
father and intimidation laughter and second reason is that it's highly

450
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:50,890
second reason is that it's highly related to what i'm doing here i'm doing

451
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:54,430
related to what i'm doing here i'm doing the noted image alignment and the melty

452
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,250
the noted image alignment and the melty image development it is the best way to

453
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:01,120
image development it is the best way to show my my algorithm itself so I'm

454
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,990
show my my algorithm itself so I'm really interested to choose excellent

455
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,900
really interested to choose excellent clarity in both insurance caps and the

456
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,510
clarity in both insurance caps and the parameter settings it's very clear for

457
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:17,560
parameter settings it's very clear for me to follow each step so I will not go

458
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,720
me to follow each step so I will not go into a loop or I don't know what's going

459
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,530
into a loop or I don't know what's going on

460
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:23,540


461
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:30,130
this report our first introduced the framers hoste them in 18 only and second

462
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,290
framers hoste them in 18 only and second how are you to introduce you their

463
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:35,590
how are you to introduce you their linear time algorithm second I add a

464
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:39,010
linear time algorithm second I add a comparison other rhythm to do this paper

465
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:43,800
comparison other rhythm to do this paper increase in previous paper the only

466
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,990
increase in previous paper the only averaging everything else which is just

467
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,270
averaging everything else which is just as units together and divide to the

468
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,540
as units together and divide to the remember a free print so I think too

469
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,960
remember a free print so I think too simple I thought to show more features

470
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,250
simple I thought to show more features of this outer limits them so I added the

471
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,430
of this outer limits them so I added the matter called Libyan 3d the original is

472
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:08,130
matter called Libyan 3d the original is very long it's a video Facebook noising

473
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,350
very long it's a video Facebook noising bye-bye passage history being truthful

474
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:15,610
bye-bye passage history being truthful it's very longer recorded vivianne 3d

475
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,850
it's very longer recorded vivianne 3d and this method should there be result

476
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:23,290
and this method should there be result in any papers so I want to show the

477
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,810
in any papers so I want to show the comparison between the people other

478
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:29,970
comparison between the people other algorithm in this paper and Libyan 3d

479
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:33,190
algorithm in this paper and Libyan 3d last I will show you the massage and we

480
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,930
last I will show you the massage and we can discuss the results

481
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:39,320
can discuss the results given given an original image composed

482
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,480
given given an original image composed of we buy the kid for a depleted image

483
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,120
of we buy the kid for a depleted image of the same size of the original one is

484
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,090
of the same size of the original one is generated by adding additive white

485
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:54,410
generated by adding additive white Gaussian noise awgn to the original one

486
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:58,310
Gaussian noise awgn to the original one suppose we independently of team K

487
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:01,070
suppose we independently of team K degrade image and he is bigger than one

488
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:04,340
degrade image and he is bigger than one we denoted the original image by the

489
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:10,010
we denoted the original image by the water so it is actually imagined you

490
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,040
water so it is actually imagined you just vectorized into a vector to

491
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,490
just vectorized into a vector to simplify the computation and it has n

492
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,310
simplify the computation and it has n pick stars

493
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,169
pick stars [Music]

494
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:23,899
[Music] skin roll a burrito you know to the case

495
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:30,139
skin roll a burrito you know to the case degraded image by the rector next I will

496
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:32,329
degraded image by the rector next I will introduce the definition of prior

497
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:36,680
introduce the definition of prior distribution for v5 a square grid graph

498
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,999
distribution for v5 a square grid graph TV in the refuge's of arrivals you know

499
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,659
TV in the refuge's of arrivals you know it in Ezra and E is the edge so the

500
00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:54,370
it in Ezra and E is the edge so the prior distribution is defined as

501
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:54,380


502
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:00,400
on July 2 the broth it's represented by the movement of

503
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,789
it's represented by the movement of energy functions

504
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:05,799


505
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:12,970
as I as I swear

506
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:12,980


507
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:20,790
the parameter team Yaya and alpha is the we want to act

508
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:29,760
we want to act the contract is

509
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:29,770


510
00:32:29,770 --> 00:33:15,400
this is because well it was people try the matter and the waves and complete

511
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,070
the matter and the waves and complete routine to the inverse of this

512
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,760
routine to the inverse of this crustacean a success in doing by natural

513
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,850
crustacean a success in doing by natural decomposition

514
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:26,860


515
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:32,749
in the model of the Moodle office

516
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:32,759


517
00:33:32,759 --> 00:34:23,789
the awgn now we are ready to find the posterior distribution

518
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:23,799


519
00:34:23,799 --> 00:34:45,619
and

520
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:45,629


521
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:50,680
we can do

522
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:50,690


523
00:34:50,690 --> 00:35:02,160
ladies position that means the profit margin lambda

524
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,170


525
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:09,160
since we're already having our prior distribution and

526
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,170


527
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:16,880
the lavenders by EMS search

528
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:16,890


529
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:25,120
Pacific that will be there to function we find a connection with to Maxine

530
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,780
we find a connection with to Maxine is illustrate the use of all production

531
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,700
is illustrate the use of all production posterior distribution are we join the

532
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,180
posterior distribution are we join the group

533
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,599
group and what special abilities we define as

534
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,020
and what special abilities we define as the production

535
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,030


536
00:35:45,030 --> 00:36:26,130
we will compute for each requires the inverse of the covariance magic makes

537
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:31,330
inverse of the covariance magic makes the computation time is thank you

538
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:31,340


539
00:36:31,340 --> 00:37:14,279
for the image restoration

540
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:14,289


541
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:23,180
time is and thank you

542
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,190


543
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:33,870
really like the immunity approximation validation they lead to a scene

544
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:33,880


545
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:41,670
what do we actually do is

546
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:41,680


547
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:50,890
Saavik type of ranchers and old and the old on the mutation time a

548
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:50,900


549
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:59,880
what to me the whole algorithm what we need to do is the partial

550
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:07,680
what we need to do is the partial derivatives in another energy the energy

551
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,120
derivatives in another energy the energy of the fire

552
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,130


553
00:38:13,130 --> 00:39:05,170
as for the Flyers for the triumph energy

554
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:05,180


555
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:31,730
no Allison Stockport this device but I is Alice

556
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:31,740


557
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:42,749
we know the gravity it can be written as

558
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:42,759


559
00:39:42,759 --> 00:40:02,200
similarly the for the area

560
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:02,210


561
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:13,160
for the determinants of decision matrix absolutely

562
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,170


563
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:28,840
really the derivative

564
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:28,850


565
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:34,460
actually very hey it converged please like them 13

566
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,670
hey it converged please like them 13 iterations and the here

567
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:41,660
iterations and the here I will first assure you it's the patch

568
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:57,840
I will first assure you it's the patch faced the baby and three

569
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:57,850


570
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:02,890
but in total we have up to

571
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:02,900


572
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:17,360
ladies to live in that we keep the one of the decree the Prince as the rapper

573
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:17,370


574
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:23,420
in the first part is just for the average of all the projects

575
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,329
average of all the projects and the second part is actually is to

576
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:29,999
and the second part is actually is to attenuate the frequency for positions

577
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:39,089
attenuate the frequency for positions that do not match the record and it is

578
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:39,099


579
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:45,730
Cynthia is constant this fix the constant actually is

580
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:49,540
constant actually is where is the noise variance would

581
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,210
where is the noise variance would activate in the footage function we

582
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,550
activate in the footage function we believe is the difference between the

583
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:59,820
believe is the difference between the touch of the rapper's

584
00:41:59,820 --> 00:41:59,830


585
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:10,720
and here is the result for the number of the gradient noise you make is 3 and the

586
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,730
the gradient noise you make is 3 and the include noise variance is their tape

587
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:25,690
include noise variance is their tape image size is 2 to 5 6 by 2 pi

588
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:25,700


589
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:33,210
I show their results by it he asked I speak tonight racial and asked to have

590
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,970
I speak tonight racial and asked to have dr. Shri Mataji

591
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:36,980


592
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:44,920
the Boosters ts the time as I am the feeder of the Badgers so if you remember

593
00:42:44,920 --> 00:43:35,910
feeder of the Badgers so if you remember the largely work to the wrong tree

594
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:35,920


595
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:54,380
[Music]

596
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:54,390


597
00:43:54,390 --> 00:44:10,130
is the result for bigger image size Oh 5 to 5

598
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:10,140


599
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:22,160
let me show you the even bigger image

600
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:22,170


601
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:27,240
yes

602
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:27,250


603
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:31,060
swing by the doctor twice

604
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:31,070


605
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:42,910
also consider the English team leader I I just popped the remark from the

606
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:54,780
I just popped the remark from the teenage member from zero enough

607
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:54,790


608
00:44:54,790 --> 00:45:01,140
the otherwise

609
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:01,150


610
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:07,420
all our three matches between that

611
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,099
that forever after leaving my village

612
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:13,000
forever after leaving my village immediately

613
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,370
immediately fifty

614
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:17,380


615
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:23,170
fool on the linear record out of two points

616
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:27,020
points these more amazing wonders

617
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:32,700
these more amazing wonders yeah they are very close to each other

618
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:32,710


619
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:36,300
according to Authority benamber may be expiated

620
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,330
expiated I also tie the image type the previous

621
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,750
I also tie the image type the previous month like five five runs to buy I

622
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,960
month like five five runs to buy I wanted things they happen maybe the

623
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,720
wanted things they happen maybe the right life the vision actually is good

624
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,340
right life the vision actually is good in the bean bag is not inclusive that

625
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,430
in the bean bag is not inclusive that price and opportunity so it's

626
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:03,690
price and opportunity so it's preventively welcome

627
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:03,700


628
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:10,020
this linear time neither can you resolve a nice image most successfully than

629
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,460
a nice image most successfully than aberration answered all the time in all

630
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:16,210
aberration answered all the time in all cases for lasher's tries on the small

631
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,480
cases for lasher's tries on the small amount of teammates read the amps medium

632
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,290
amount of teammates read the amps medium 3d is the little battery tender linear

633
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:26,380
3d is the little battery tender linear time but for the larger amount of image

634
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:31,530
time but for the larger amount of image linear matters profound

635
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:31,540


636
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:36,780
maybe the owl earlier the selenium Athens rather than amazing of countries

637
00:46:36,780 --> 00:47:07,350
Athens rather than amazing of countries in my legs

638
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:07,360


639
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:15,890
so your posture is why the number of minutes notice

640
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:15,900


641
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:30,280
let's play of equation two

642
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:30,290


643
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:36,080
if you have a distribution or even for the options and the big hominoid

644
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:42,470
the options and the big hominoid be affected by the tsunami the marries

645
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:47,420
be affected by the tsunami the marries of noise won't be pleased Sigma square

646
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,450
of noise won't be pleased Sigma square well if you crease the into Sigma square

647
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:54,800
well if you crease the into Sigma square a you're in it so the more the more you

648
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:00,200
a you're in it so the more the more you makes you get Latino is very you have so

649
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,700
makes you get Latino is very you have so is something like they'd like to add

650
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,330
is something like they'd like to add them together and the the the noise

651
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:19,999
them together and the the the noise variance

652
00:48:19,999 --> 00:48:20,009


653
00:48:20,009 --> 00:48:24,779
would you mean a cookie

654
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:24,789


655
00:48:24,789 --> 00:48:34,689
if it's difference between the 932 NASA wonder for all of the matter the

656
00:48:34,689 --> 00:48:37,940
wonder for all of the matter the computation time will increase

657
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:42,200
computation time will increase the number of units for the aboriginal

658
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,359
the number of units for the aboriginal it's very small always lifestyle website

659
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:46,370
it's very small always lifestyle website because you didn't do that keep

660
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:48,650
because you didn't do that keep syntactic it has to actually add them

661
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:52,130
syntactic it has to actually add them together but for the other matter it

662
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,950
together but for the other matter it really depends depends on the speech of

663
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:59,949
really depends depends on the speech of matter

664
00:48:59,949 --> 00:48:59,959


665
00:48:59,959 --> 00:49:03,510
I find it

666
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:03,520


667
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:12,390
with more image members the living their master has less computation time than we

668
00:49:12,390 --> 00:51:04,170
master has less computation time than we do you have

669
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:04,180


670
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:10,470
oh hello everyone my name is Lucy same way I'm from the aerospace and

671
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:16,109
way I'm from the aerospace and mechanical engineering taking this

672
00:51:16,109 --> 00:51:18,960
mechanical engineering taking this course it's kind of cold but a great

673
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,329
course it's kind of cold but a great challenge for me and it's my pleasure to

674
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:24,299
challenge for me and it's my pleasure to do my presentation about delivering

675
00:51:24,299 --> 00:51:29,309
do my presentation about delivering using the things I learned in the car I

676
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:33,890
using the things I learned in the car I do this because of its very interesting

677
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:40,349
do this because of its very interesting project on the website so when we

678
00:51:40,349 --> 00:51:43,940
project on the website so when we thought should be laboring we can find a

679
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:49,170
thought should be laboring we can find a lot of examples we can the most famous

680
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:52,230
lot of examples we can the most famous woman is a Caltech 1:01 the labels

681
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:55,109
woman is a Caltech 1:01 the labels airplanes or other object tools in our

682
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:57,270
airplanes or other object tools in our daily lives like a chair or table or

683
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:00,059
daily lives like a chair or table or whatever you can say of recently there's

684
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:06,230
whatever you can say of recently there's another image love love they label these

685
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:11,059
another image love love they label these birds and they can characterize about

686
00:52:11,059 --> 00:52:16,470
birds and they can characterize about either and this is also the reason why

687
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:19,140
either and this is also the reason why we do this labeling before because if

688
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,569
we do this labeling before because if you want to know what this is you first

689
00:52:21,569 --> 00:52:26,250
you want to know what this is you first have to label yet you have a big picture

690
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:30,410
have to label yet you have a big picture then we have to say where is the object

691
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:34,590
then we have to say where is the object this is a primary step

692
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:38,040
this is a primary step when we search on Google who can render

693
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,890
when we search on Google who can render some papers they talk about this project

694
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:44,100
some papers they talk about this project please kind of true product it is a

695
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:48,870
please kind of true product it is a customer Redmond field and we have great

696
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:52,290
customer Redmond field and we have great observations and the hidden value about

697
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:55,610
observations and the hidden value about the hand observe reservations image and

698
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:58,050
the hand observe reservations image and popular methods are iterative

699
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,260
popular methods are iterative conditional mode this Laster we have a

700
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,360
conditional mode this Laster we have a homework in human to when you do this

701
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,420
homework in human to when you do this this is the beginning of this project

702
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:11,550
this is the beginning of this project then based on these at the end we can do

703
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:16,950
then based on these at the end we can do a graphic art and god Carter actually it

704
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:20,070
a graphic art and god Carter actually it can be applied not only on this idea we

705
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:23,430
can be applied not only on this idea we can also applied on Vicki and thousand

706
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:26,370
can also applied on Vicki and thousand methods because the growth current

707
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,850
methods because the growth current basically it can kill a lot of cool

708
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:34,640
basically it can kill a lot of cool pixels not only one pixels and then

709
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,930
pixels not only one pixels and then distill method I will talk about is the

710
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:41,490
distill method I will talk about is the loop he believes to propagation

711
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:41,500


712
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:47,940
poster staffer to catch the master depositing metal and an advanced master

713
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:50,210
depositing metal and an advanced master that would be sequential train waited

714
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,860
that would be sequential train waited message conference which is based on

715
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:57,660
message conference which is based on Avicii and when I talk about this method

716
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,230
Avicii and when I talk about this method I hope you can tell me where I'm wrong

717
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:08,910
I hope you can tell me where I'm wrong because we can say this equation in our

718
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:18,000
because we can say this equation in our work part is observed by the total

719
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,730
work part is observed by the total energy the Sun from the observation and

720
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:26,190
energy the Sun from the observation and the neighbor neighbor the most important

721
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:27,520
the neighbor neighbor the most important part is

722
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,220
part is actually both important under this label

723
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:34,060
actually both important under this label will be actual consume the states naval

724
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:36,490
will be actual consume the states naval reserve information we came out to

725
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,900
reserve information we came out to change because it is what would help and

726
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,880
change because it is what would help and by some summarizes these two parts to

727
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,330
by some summarizes these two parts to have a total energy and whether accept

728
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,760
have a total energy and whether accept or not attractive is the picked

729
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,940
or not attractive is the picked alternative decided by the energy

730
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,160
alternative decided by the energy whether it's decrease or increase in the

731
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,250
whether it's decrease or increase in the Angela will have lowest damages when we

732
00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:06,780
Angela will have lowest damages when we turn all the pixels and we do a lot of

733
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:06,790


734
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:16,090
images and also the weighting factors work from the preservation of bronze

735
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:19,180
work from the preservation of bronze neighbor we can till this part we

736
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,940
neighbor we can till this part we increase or under the division the image

737
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,520
increase or under the division the image will be different and then I will talk

738
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,190
will be different and then I will talk about the graph card both parties are

739
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:31,630
about the graph card both parties are for this part we tune with those colors

740
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:34,560
for this part we tune with those colors it's like a freezer we cut through these

741
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,230
it's like a freezer we cut through these parts and was an account or not it's

742
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,720
parts and was an account or not it's also described by the energy if Y

743
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,870
also described by the energy if Y invalid in brought carton 2000 army just

744
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:46,300
invalid in brought carton 2000 army just calculate the energy again but it will

745
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,390
calculate the energy again but it will be more computational cost because the

746
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,340
be more computational cost because the number of neighbors is enlarged the one

747
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,740
number of neighbors is enlarged the one I do this record and if I increase the

748
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:58,210
I do this record and if I increase the say the size or the D if I want to throw

749
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:03,600
say the size or the D if I want to throw up a lot of pixels and tram will be very

750
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,730
up a lot of pixels and tram will be very maybe not very good for some complicated

751
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:16,950
maybe not very good for some complicated applications but it's very effective

752
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:16,960


753
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:37,040
in my study I didn't surprises not broadcasting to the party it's

754
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:37,050


755
00:56:37,050 --> 00:57:09,480
minimization actually there are a lot of ways to recount all the messages this is

756
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,329
ways to recount all the messages this is actually in my case I did it similar to

757
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:15,030
actually in my case I did it similar to the sequential trade I needed to decide

758
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:18,210
the sequential trade I needed to decide how to accept all of the messages and I

759
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:20,910
how to accept all of the messages and I needed to actually decide the formation

760
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:24,450
needed to actually decide the formation of the trade inside of this mark and in

761
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:27,450
of the trade inside of this mark and in my case I just do love to write the top

762
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:34,289
my case I just do love to write the top bottom and my last part again when I

763
00:57:34,289 --> 00:57:37,349
bottom and my last part again when I can't do a color of the pixel I needed

764
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:41,609
can't do a color of the pixel I needed to maximize this message and in

765
00:57:41,609 --> 00:57:44,010
to maximize this message and in calculation I do also make them because

766
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:47,700
calculation I do also make them because these two are all written in turn we

767
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,980
these two are all written in turn we won't find the maximized

768
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:50,990


769
00:57:50,990 --> 00:58:02,990
and what we want is to have a larger be under simulate society and I have a

770
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:05,599
under simulate society and I have a weighting factors order from other

771
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,080
weighting factors order from other messages from the reservation and from

772
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,540
messages from the reservation and from some neighbors for neighbors in this

773
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:19,500
some neighbors for neighbors in this case the respect eyes

774
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:19,510


775
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:27,359
I mean the contrary to the message passing is the singular is the munster

776
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:31,410
passing is the singular is the munster of believe the publication this case the

777
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:38,330
of believe the publication this case the way how I we have a complicated not here

778
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:40,859
way how I we have a complicated not here it's maybe more complicated than range

779
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:44,400
it's maybe more complicated than range but we can the composite into a lot of

780
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,220
but we can the composite into a lot of groups very simple tree then we

781
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,880
groups very simple tree then we summarize the messages from each of

782
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,080
summarize the messages from each of trainees we get a total messages and

783
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,540
trainees we get a total messages and this works well well and there are a lot

784
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,670
this works well well and there are a lot of things we can design here first is

785
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:02,970
of things we can design here first is how weighted the composer the traced and

786
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:06,090
how weighted the composer the traced and how a way to infiltrate this will be

787
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:11,510
how a way to infiltrate this will be very interesting and in this case in my

788
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:19,790
very interesting and in this case in my coding I got to this left to right and

789
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:19,800


790
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:48,190
with I want to images from the quality library and

791
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:53,140
library and and the way I needed to close to turn

792
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:57,219
and the way I needed to close to turn these to a color RPG into a black white

793
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:01,839
these to a color RPG into a black white I just to use my bathroom like to try

794
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:04,599
I just to use my bathroom like to try the at which the range it should be

795
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:15,339
the at which the range it should be black this is after I am and which is

796
01:00:15,339 --> 01:00:19,349
black this is after I am and which is still the black inside is a white

797
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:38,680
still the black inside is a white surrounded by the whites then I energy

798
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:44,950
surrounded by the whites then I energy is decreasing is no way to sit down the

799
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:48,009
is decreasing is no way to sit down the later I used here I can actually use

800
01:00:48,009 --> 01:00:53,620
later I used here I can actually use different

801
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:53,630


802
01:00:53,630 --> 01:01:03,190
this is the using I send along the board and this is mix good

803
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:03,200


804
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:14,289
drop cards here and here the culture is not very good and this is the

805
01:01:14,289 --> 01:01:18,940
not very good and this is the propagation to believe to be I this is

806
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:22,480
propagation to believe to be I this is the eyes to try summarize to all the be

807
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:28,630
the eyes to try summarize to all the be other images actually long as you stab

808
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:37,240
other images actually long as you stab it just convert this is the message

809
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:45,640
it just convert this is the message accounting I to make a trade

810
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:45,650


811
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:54,010
because of my coding is only doing this to images then I I just gotta spell this

812
01:01:54,010 --> 01:02:00,460
to images then I I just gotta spell this - he looks - fine then I I can also

813
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:11,070
- he looks - fine then I I can also chill before well how do they do

814
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:11,080


815
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:27,500
suppose this tasty I said if I pick another image

816
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:27,510


817
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:46,800
this leads to labels or suppose it's looked also very good for ITN

818
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:46,810


819
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:52,890
this was true

820
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:52,900


821
01:02:52,900 --> 01:03:15,280
wonderful Oh

822
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:15,290


823
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:22,650
in this case I am Prince multi-ball a good because socially big marzyong

824
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:26,710
good because socially big marzyong remove this part we we don't like the

825
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:30,400
remove this part we we don't like the sustain those heart believes to

826
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:46,710
sustain those heart believes to constrain

827
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:46,720


828
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:59,580
- much better than Medicaid

829
01:03:59,580 --> 01:03:59,590


830
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:07,770
and also mr. Messer the sequence to the trailer which is not a department is too

831
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:08,990
trailer which is not a department is too flexible

832
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:13,380
flexible masterda assume look at those parameters

833
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:20,040
masterda assume look at those parameters wait until the weight of each of three I

834
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:24,240
wait until the weight of each of three I have two here and also the way to strong

835
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,960
have two here and also the way to strong evidence and the weight from neighbors

836
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,260
evidence and the weight from neighbors we can tune those and the if I kill me

837
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:38,030
we can tune those and the if I kill me too

838
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:38,040


839
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:48,529
and in one way of

840
01:04:48,529 --> 01:04:48,539


841
01:04:48,539 --> 01:04:52,760
this could be

842
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:52,770


843
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:59,390
I don't know whether this is bad enough but listen can lead to us all those that

844
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:04,640
but listen can lead to us all those that we can select a path parameter this

845
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,010
we can select a path parameter this become a higher quality of photos to the

846
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:19,440
become a higher quality of photos to the picture mechanizations

847
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:19,450


848
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:45,030
because if we make it too far along

849
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:45,040


850
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:50,270
you know this is the truth our ultra spot please the whole part is to

851
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:56,240
spot please the whole part is to becoming the boat because i propagate

852
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:02,240
becoming the boat because i propagate left to right I think after tandem

853
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:10,020
left to right I think after tandem dominant this trilogy is the final a

854
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:12,660
dominant this trilogy is the final a code of throne that love a house I think

855
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:29,380
code of throne that love a house I think they did a very good coding

856
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:29,390


857
01:06:29,390 --> 01:07:44,580
of

858
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:44,590


859
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:48,450
thank you for your attention

860
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:48,460


861
01:07:48,460 --> 01:08:12,830
[Applause]

862
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:12,840


863
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:52,099
yeah

864
01:08:52,099 --> 01:08:52,109


865
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:54,830
  I don't know
