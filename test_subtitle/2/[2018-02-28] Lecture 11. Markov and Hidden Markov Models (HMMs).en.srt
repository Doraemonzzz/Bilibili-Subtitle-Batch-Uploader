1
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:14,610
all right I have not posted this lecture yet it's more than 200 pages and I

2
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,240
yet it's more than 200 pages and I almost have only 10 pages left you know

3
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,670
almost have only 10 pages left you know so let's open the mentary stop so I'm

4
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,080
so let's open the mentary stop so I'm going to be jumping through but I will

5
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,630
going to be jumping through but I will try to finish the last ten pages today

6
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:30,240
try to finish the last ten pages today and post them by the end of the day so I

7
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,560
and post them by the end of the day so I assume all the projects have been

8
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,820
assume all the projects have been submitted including from those who have

9
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,680
submitted including from those who have no plans to submit project all right and

10
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,710
no plans to submit project all right and so we have permission projects and the

11
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,800
so we have permission projects and the deadline was yesterday okay so we need

12
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,940
deadline was yesterday okay so we need project all right so we're going to do

13
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,780
project all right so we're going to do is I'm going to go through you know

14
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,949
is I'm going to go through you know notice there is another point mental

15
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,800
notice there is another point mental state today because I'm over a million

16
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,170
state today because I'm over a million things when we are trying to jump

17
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,020
things when we are trying to jump through the flight to be sure we cover

18
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,460
through the flight to be sure we cover some essential topics and depending on

19
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,759
some essential topics and depending on where we are we decide on Thursday if we

20
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,970
where we are we decide on Thursday if we continue this lecturer would jump to

21
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,190
continue this lecturer would jump to state-space models the slides are very

22
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,500
state-space models the slides are very easy so you guys can read them in detail

23
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,890
easy so you guys can read them in detail so I'm gonna try to to do some something

24
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,759
so I'm gonna try to to do some something here there so things I want to discuss

25
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,259
here there so things I want to discuss today hopefully we will have time to do

26
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,630
today hopefully we will have time to do this how do we complete parameters in

27
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,030
this how do we complete parameters in hmm models and in computing parameters

28
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,890
hmm models and in computing parameters we will see that we need to integrate

29
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,740
we will see that we need to integrate the algorithms for forward and backward

30
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,620
the algorithms for forward and backward passing message passing basically those

31
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,900
passing message passing basically those messages will serve as essential

32
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,250
messages will serve as essential statistics that will allow us to

33
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,280
statistics that will allow us to complete parameters given some training

34
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,900
complete parameters given some training data okay

35
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,130
data okay what number was so I'm going to be

36
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,130
what number was so I'm going to be jumping slide and I'm going to go we

37
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,480
jumping slide and I'm going to go we stopped last lecture on slide 21 so we

38
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,580
stopped last lecture on slide 21 so we can deal extinct

39
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:23,070
can deal extinct simple training with a Markov model okay

40
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,080


41
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,890
conservatively the the problem of learning basically mercy consists of

42
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,110
learning basically mercy consists of words and I'm going to introduce some

43
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:40,290
words and I'm going to introduce some probability models over a single word so

44
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:40,300


45
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,990
information the time is time implies sequence in a sentence okay so it's not

46
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,240
sequence in a sentence okay so it's not really I mean you can apply this as

47
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,410
really I mean you can apply this as opposed when you talk alright so this

48
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,060
opposed when you talk alright so this can be represented once at the given

49
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,750
can be represented once at the given time but right now is world within a

50
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,720
time but right now is world within a text question so this is what we call

51
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,170
text question so this is what we call the Ingram probability this is a bigram

52
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,390
the Ingram probability this is a bigram probability so what's the next word

53
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,340
probability so what's the next word going to be given the previous world and

54
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,160
going to be given the previous world and this is what is the next word given the

55
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,150
this is what is the next word given the previous two words

56
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,860
previous two words so we can train a model like that given

57
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,260
so we can train a model like that given data and do some circuit elementary

58
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,380
data and do some circuit elementary statistics

59
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,860
statistics with some prior modeling to do that this

60
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,360
with some prior modeling to do that this is an essential problem if you are

61
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,420
is an essential problem if you are interested to complete the sentence if

62
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,370
interested to complete the sentence if you want to compress basically text and

63
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,040
you want to compress basically text and also if you want to write automatically

64
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,159
also if you want to write automatically without you know any interference from a

65
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,920
without you know any interference from a human you want to write in a stay which

66
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,170
human you want to write in a stay which of course may not be reading anything

67
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,550
of course may not be reading anything but you know if you want anything

68
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,980
but you know if you want anything somebody will buy okay so this is

69
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,980
somebody will buy okay so this is textbook all right some missed an

70
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,020
textbook all right some missed an example of this probabilities of the

71
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,930
example of this probabilities of the Engram probabilities for the different

72
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,550
Engram probabilities for the different letters they enjoyed in the alphabet and

73
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,340
letters they enjoyed in the alphabet and the first letter is basically implies

74
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,520
the first letter is basically implies nothing unknown so as timber basically

75
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,890
nothing unknown so as timber basically doesn't exist within those symbols this

76
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,719
doesn't exist within those symbols this is the Biograph probabilities to

77
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:16,240
is the Biograph probabilities to transition from one letter to another

78
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,320
transition from one letter to another the biggest this white spaces the high

79
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,210
the biggest this white spaces the high of this probability door so this is sort

80
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,379
of this probability door so this is sort of like a kingdom diagram

81
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:27,270
of like a kingdom diagram so we're going to have trick to the

82
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,839
so we're going to have trick to the mathematical problem and we will try to

83
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,089
mathematical problem and we will try to explain this in the context of sentences

84
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:35,850
explain this in the context of sentences the algebra but a very sort of universal

85
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,189
the algebra but a very sort of universal even for hidden Markov models that he

86
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,140
even for hidden Markov models that he understands this we can understand a

87
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,050
understands this we can understand a little bit more complex pro model the

88
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,339
little bit more complex pro model the Markov chain is rather hidden Markov

89
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,279
Markov chain is rather hidden Markov model right so we have it's a next Ronix

90
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,879
model right so we have it's a next Ronix to our X capital T so using conditional

91
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,770
to our X capital T so using conditional independence relations we like this like

92
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,510
independence relations we like this like that this is the probability of the

93
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,629
that this is the probability of the initial state so this is given and this

94
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,070
initial state so this is given and this of the transition probabilities from

95
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,999
of the transition probabilities from state X want you to XT minus 1 to X T

96
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:11,519
state X want you to XT minus 1 to X T and I can run a test in a much nicer

97
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,010
and I can run a test in a much nicer format the way that you see on the third

98
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,200
format the way that you see on the third lines I want you to pay close attention

99
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,320
lines I want you to pay close attention because sort of the notation is very

100
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,129
because sort of the notation is very standard these are many other problems

101
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:25,559
standard these are many other problems for mixed models and and the like so you

102
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:27,749
for mixed models and and the like so you know this is a standard way to write the

103
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:30,329
know this is a standard way to write the joint probability distribution given the

104
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:32,279
joint probability distribution given the parameters and parameters here referring

105
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:35,279
parameters and parameters here referring to the probability the initial

106
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,930
to the probability the initial probabilities of being upstaged a and

107
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,010
probabilities of being upstaged a and the transition probabilities may carry

108
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,570
the transition probabilities may carry transitioning from state a to state K so

109
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,659
transitioning from state a to state K so look at this again does this make sense

110
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:54,620
look at this again does this make sense is this the same as what we see up there

111
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:54,630


112
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,570
so how do you understand can't see the probability of x1 now this is written

113
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,970
probability of x1 now this is written like that so what does not mean the big

114
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,070
like that so what does not mean the big is the indicator function right so it's

115
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,680
is the indicator function right so it's Rondo and the argument is school zero

116
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,400
Rondo and the argument is school zero otherwise

117
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,870
otherwise so as this don't do here addiction is on

118
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,960
so as this don't do here addiction is on state one right then I have a space for

119
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,540
state one right then I have a space for a lot of times

120
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:28,040
a lot of times so if x1 is equal to let's say is the

121
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,490
so if x1 is equal to let's say is the state Z so this time what will give me

122
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:37,250
state Z so this time what will give me you will give me PJ and if x1 isn't a

123
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,710
you will give me PJ and if x1 isn't a means x1 is not in all the other states

124
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,170
means x1 is not in all the other states so if this process all the attempts will

125
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,660
so if this process all the attempts will give me basically a power of 0 which

126
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,040
give me basically a power of 0 which will result to 1 okay all right so this

127
00:08:49,040 --> 00:09:03,730
will result to 1 okay all right so this is the way to write P of x1 and

128
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:03,740


129
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,930
sentences each with length T all right so this is the one would say in tax but

130
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,070
so this is the one would say in tax but has okay so this is a point remove a

131
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,890
has okay so this is a point remove a sequence this is a beautiful in the

132
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,620
sequence this is a beautiful in the states of J and K and this probability

133
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,540
states of J and K and this probability of transitions to say JK to this

134
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,180
of transitions to say JK to this indicator function transitioning from J

135
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:32,810
indicator function transitioning from J of T minus 1 to K and what interested to

136
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,330
of T minus 1 to K and what interested to compute a JK I mean most of the things

137
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,690
compute a JK I mean most of the things we have done up to now we assume that

138
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,520
we have done up to now we assume that this parameters are known now we don't

139
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,710
this parameters are known now we don't know these parameters and we're going to

140
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,550
know these parameters and we're going to compute them from data so interesting

141
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,820
compute them from data so interesting here will be

142
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,510
here will be this one will it's a sequence of words

143
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,330
this one will it's a sequence of words of lengthy but now I'm going to have any

144
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,290
of lengthy but now I'm going to have any sequence of words each of them having

145
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:04,400
sequence of words each of them having length all right so I'm going to

146
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,120
length all right so I'm going to basically text of different lengths so

147
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,960
basically text of different lengths so x1 we have a lengthy one words executed

148
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,650
x1 we have a lengthy one words executed 2 etc but if you not you can take that

149
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,060
2 etc but if you not you can take that the length of each of this is the same

150
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:26,660
the length of each of this is the same so the is given semester of the logs i

151
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,210
so the is given semester of the logs i given theta and i'm making it like that

152
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,490
given theta and i'm making it like that so i want you to look hard from this

153
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,930
so i want you to look hard from this equation the third line a went to the

154
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:40,510
equation the third line a went to the nothing to it questions this make sense

155
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:40,520


156
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,980
to describe estimation ferrymen which is all my data sets i push it in the works

157
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,310
all my data sets i push it in the works okay and I left the summation so maybe

158
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,230
okay and I left the summation so maybe people books this progress ever becomes

159
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,360
people books this progress ever becomes summation right so I first destination

160
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,720
summation right so I first destination over the states outside and this

161
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,610
over the states outside and this summation over the data sets they push

162
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,490
summation over the data sets they push it inside should I get on this term I

163
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,030
it inside should I get on this term I get this all right and in this term I'm

164
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,130
get this all right and in this term I'm going to push the summation over n an

165
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,730
going to push the summation over n an estimation over the length of verse

166
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,220
estimation over the length of verse sentences inside and then the

167
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,950
sentences inside and then the estimations over the states I will leave

168
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,970
estimations over the states I will leave them outside and the usually not missus

169
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,460
them outside and the usually not missus blaze what I mean is I'm colorblind so

170
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,380
blaze what I mean is I'm colorblind so it's not like I'm doing it because I

171
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,890
it's not like I'm doing it because I enjoy a lot right so what's the reason

172
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,660
enjoy a lot right so what's the reason we mark them for a reason here so what

173
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,350
we mark them for a reason here so what you see this mr. blue colors what are

174
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,270
you see this mr. blue colors what are they for this nation of the parameters

175
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,480
they for this nation of the parameters theta Mr mouse won't know whether we

176
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,330
theta Mr mouse won't know whether we gonna call this

177
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:47,340


178
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:52,880
this is where the information from the data comes so in estimating this part of

179
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,280
data comes so in estimating this part of the speed day and alpha JK the only

180
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,810
the speed day and alpha JK the only information we need this to know this

181
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,610
information we need this to know this quantity this can be so rapidly how do

182
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:08,900
quantity this can be so rapidly how do we call them

183
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:08,910


184
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:14,210
well in principle evidence dissolve this right this is the evidence of the day

185
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,960
right this is the evidence of the day cow so but the very top the bank as

186
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,770
cow so but the very top the bank as independent entities excise a right they

187
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,200
independent entities excise a right they come in making the parameters theta

188
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,630
come in making the parameters theta inside those big summations by anything

189
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,880
inside those big summations by anything we need to know the individual data we

190
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,950
we need to know the individual data we need to know these summations so this

191
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,010
need to know these summations so this summation is in blue or what mister

192
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,910
summation is in blue or what mister patient statistics so you will need this

193
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,470
patient statistics so you will need this to know this blue quantities so I am

194
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,720
to know this blue quantities so I am going to Congress than j1 and I'm gonna

195
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,390
going to Congress than j1 and I'm gonna call this and JK so which words can you

196
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,970
call this and JK so which words can you tell me what isn't anyone so looking at

197
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,340
tell me what isn't anyone so looking at this body that's you know miss baptize

198
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,520
this body that's you know miss baptize it something and j1 because there's a J

199
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,250
it something and j1 because there's a J there there's no I I'm summing Ally and

200
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,890
there there's no I I'm summing Ally and because this refers to state 1 Americas

201
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,280
because this refers to state 1 Americas and J 1 so what is this in words what

202
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,640
and J 1 so what is this in words what sends L 1 I mean obviously mister

203
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,710
sends L 1 I mean obviously mister indicator function some looking at all

204
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,700
indicator function some looking at all the data all right and I'm accounting in

205
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,010
the data all right and I'm accounting in my data set so I have n of laws and

206
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,080
my data set so I have n of laws and sultans this arm accounting how many

207
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:32,580
sultans this arm accounting how many times what

208
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:32,590


209
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:41,190
the first segment is on the web state we should take one and I'ma counting how

210
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,480
should take one and I'ma counting how many times the state one is or what one

211
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:52,260
many times the state one is or what one say some particular Makati how many

212
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,930
say some particular Makati how many times the first and the first world in

213
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,620
times the first and the first world in the end documents is that particular war

214
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:03,150
the end documents is that particular war okay this is again next refers to the

215
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,700
okay this is again next refers to the data thirds right this is the state one

216
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,579
data thirds right this is the state one of each of the sentences I remind you x1

217
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:12,810
of each of the sentences I remind you x1 is a sentence of length TI all right

218
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,750
is a sentence of length TI all right x10 is another long sentence of words of

219
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,710
x10 is another long sentence of words of length T I am okay to capitulate all

220
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,380
length T I am okay to capitulate all right what is the symbol now what is

221
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,930
right what is the symbol now what is this sufficient statistic so I'm coming

222
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:30,200
this sufficient statistic so I'm coming over other data over all the words in it

223
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,690
over other data over all the words in it data set in each of this X 1 to X

224
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,090
data set in each of this X 1 to X capital N and I'm accounting work in

225
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:41,460
capital N and I'm accounting work in those sentences some accounting in all

226
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:45,360
those sentences some accounting in all my data how many times a time T I was

227
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,480
my data how many times a time T I was from state J and the time T plus 1 I was

228
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,340
from state J and the time T plus 1 I was of state K all right so we have two

229
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,870
of state K all right so we have two versions right how many times the pay T

230
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,050
versions right how many times the pay T was the what J and how many times the

231
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,120
was the what J and how many times the stated most one simultaneously was on

232
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:10,590
stated most one simultaneously was on state K I can the log-likelihood as

233
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,320
state K I can the log-likelihood as these sufficient statistic times without

234
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,800
these sufficient statistic times without sufficient statistic and I do alright I

235
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,240
sufficient statistic and I do alright I don't have time to go through the

236
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,579
don't have time to go through the algebra but I want you to look sort of

237
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:21,240
algebra but I want you to look sort of visual

238
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,410
visual we do now to find the parameters by Jay

239
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,999
we do now to find the parameters by Jay and DJ Kay this is sort of a generic

240
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:30,929
and DJ Kay this is sort of a generic inference problem called discrete

241
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:34,050
inference problem called discrete distributions so you should have some

242
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,540
distributions so you should have some good idea on how to do this so how do

243
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,429
good idea on how to do this so how do you compute this power that speeds Aryan

244
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:50,610
you compute this power that speeds Aryan alpha DK I give you the results are

245
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:58,740
alpha DK I give you the results are coming in my model maximizing the

246
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,030
coming in my model maximizing the evidence cause we're gonna take

247
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,040
evidence cause we're gonna take derivatives with respect to Phi J and

248
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,210
derivatives with respect to Phi J and alpha J carry in taking the remnants of

249
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,429
alpha J carry in taking the remnants of this with respect to Phi J you also have

250
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:10,019
this with respect to Phi J you also have to enhance this with something else

251
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,449
to enhance this with something else because the PI J's are not independent

252
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:16,230
because the PI J's are not independent of each other if you take the sum over I

253
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:25,110
of each other if you take the sum over I mean at some state so the terrified

254
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,920
mean at some state so the terrified zatia's to be equal to one alright so

255
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,629
zatia's to be equal to one alright so that we need to do is we need to send

256
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,759
that we need to do is we need to send additional grants multiplier to enforce

257
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,040
additional grants multiplier to enforce the children gonna have to add here a

258
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,189
the children gonna have to add here a term 1/2 times the summation of the Phi

259
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:42,110
term 1/2 times the summation of the Phi J's for take will run to K - Ronnie

260
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:47,960
J's for take will run to K - Ronnie right

261
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:47,970


262
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:54,119
and we take also vary with respect to PI J including the term you will get this

263
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:56,189
J including the term you will get this and partial derivative with respect to a

264
00:16:56,189 --> 00:17:00,179
and partial derivative with respect to a JK you will get that the business will

265
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:02,309
JK you will get that the business will collapse this are central to the obvious

266
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:05,159
collapse this are central to the obvious answer so you say I do not have to do

267
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:06,689
answer so you say I do not have to do any calculations because I know what the

268
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:08,970
any calculations because I know what the answer is going to be but obviously we

269
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,620
answer is going to be but obviously we need this methodology for more complex

270
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,340
need this methodology for more complex problems so with this project

271
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,600
problems so with this project what was the physical meaning offends

272
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,820
what was the physical meaning offends anyone again

273
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:18,830


274
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:26,530
there is how many times in my data sets the step one was upwards I divide it by

275
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,590
the step one was upwards I divide it by how many times I was on anything on

276
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,730
how many times I was on anything on state one let's take one red one okay

277
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,690
state one let's take one red one okay and counting how many times to hit

278
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,170
and counting how many times to hit transitions from state day to carry

279
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:44,830
transitions from state day to carry visitors you know how many times I have

280
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,930
visitors you know how many times I have transitioned from as a to whatever okay

281
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:54,160
transitioned from as a to whatever okay it is really significant transitions

282
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,530
it is really significant transitions from the people to whatever active comm

283
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,040
from the people to whatever active comm transitions from stage a is this the

284
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,410
transitions from stage a is this the normalization factor from j2 anything

285
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,110
normalization factor from j2 anything else so actually to make it sort of more

286
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,450
else so actually to make it sort of more nice and looking at you put the K prime

287
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:17,860
nice and looking at you put the K prime there and K Prime this result okay this

288
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,380
there and K Prime this result okay this models are computationally very

289
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,570
models are computationally very difficult to work with because we

290
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:30,210
difficult to work with because we introduced this probabilities that you

291
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,160
introduced this probabilities that you here for improve immediately basically

292
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,400
here for improve immediately basically like what we did with the inference from

293
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,950
like what we did with the inference from with the parameter estimation problem

294
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,900
with the parameter estimation problem how many parameters we have just to make

295
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:46,260
how many parameters we have just to make theory each of the states it's K

296
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,270


297
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:53,080
the message saying that we computed how many years if this is K and K T squared

298
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,010
many years if this is K and K T squared all right so if you have an engine

299
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:01,000
all right so if you have an engine community this will be K to the power n

300
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,320
community this will be K to the power n so this is computationally very

301
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,610
so this is computationally very expensive and the wrong data sets and I

302
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,940
expensive and the wrong data sets and I was moving actually the other day so one

303
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,220
was moving actually the other day so one of those later says but you can download

304
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,170
of those later says but you can download as 30,000 words and the number of profit

305
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,910
as 30,000 words and the number of profit is basically to calibrate the model and

306
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,220
is basically to calibrate the model and this term diagram model is 2.5 billion

307
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,360
this term diagram model is 2.5 billion parameters actually this is not trivial

308
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,110
parameters actually this is not trivial because you know the model is not

309
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:42,880
because you know the model is not computationally expensive so it's not we

310
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,060
computationally expensive so it's not we need to go away from maximizing the

311
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,310
need to go away from maximizing the likelihood of the data and maybe do

312
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,560
likelihood of the data and maybe do something Bayesian here so this can be

313
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,180
something Bayesian here so this can be give me the situation where the model

314
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:59,680
give me the situation where the model that we discussed will not work so you

315
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,080
that we discussed will not work so you have the Italian the data with a few

316
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,610
have the Italian the data with a few sentences that contain a few words and

317
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,190
sentences that contain a few words and and you know we computed transition

318
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,100
and you know we computed transition probabilities you know and obviously you

319
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,020
probabilities you know and obviously you can do predictions you know you can and

320
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,420
can do predictions you know you can and I will do it actually hopefully in a few

321
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,610
I will do it actually hopefully in a few minutes you can predict what the next

322
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,430
minutes you can predict what the next word is going to be but why do we need

323
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,610
word is going to be but why do we need to do Bayesian rather much more likely

324
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:31,030
to do Bayesian rather much more likely if it's there in the specific mode of

325
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,730
if it's there in the specific mode of the language model what can go wrong

326
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:43,640
the language model what can go wrong with family

327
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:43,650


328
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,170
so that we would say in the training sentences which is missing would you

329
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,650
sentences which is missing would you ever be able to predict that work no

330
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,130
ever be able to predict that work no okay so obviously there are lots of

331
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,260
okay so obviously there are lots of tricks you can go about this all right

332
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,990
tricks you can go about this all right and they go with different names but I'm

333
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,060
and they go with different names but I'm gonna show you briefly on how we can do

334
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,990
gonna show you briefly on how we can do a 20 million population but let me just

335
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:16,280
a 20 million population but let me just put all of these things up here in the

336
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:23,810
put all of these things up here in the estimation you in the when we estimated

337
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,480
estimation you in the when we estimated this parameter say we defined basically

338
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,650
this parameter say we defined basically the MLE estimate as being n JK / MJ in

339
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,260
the MLE estimate as being n JK / MJ in science basically the transitions from J

340
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,419
science basically the transitions from J to anything else and when you sum the

341
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,390
to anything else and when you sum the mjk whole case you get we do know this

342
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,630
mjk whole case you get we do know this as n sorry right so a way to fix

343
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,950
as n sorry right so a way to fix whatever problems you have with Emily is

344
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,060
whatever problems you have with Emily is irrelevant

345
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,669
irrelevant taking the Emily estimate for a JK use

346
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:54,140
taking the Emily estimate for a JK use some weighted average of what you

347
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,330
some weighted average of what you completely with Emily and also the K

348
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,530
completely with Emily and also the K where things NK divided by L so here

349
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,419
where things NK divided by L so here we're interested in the transitions from

350
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:09,169
we're interested in the transitions from Zeta K but this term does what it

351
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:11,960
Zeta K but this term does what it accounts for many times I see the word

352
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,720
accounts for many times I see the word cake it doesn't really care about

353
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,980
cake it doesn't really care about transitions

354
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,970
transitions okay so and this is you select Atlanta

355
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,030
okay so and this is you select Atlanta cross validation so this is not Bayesian

356
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,340
cross validation so this is not Bayesian we will see how possibly we can get

357
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,870
we will see how possibly we can get something like that with a basin

358
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,169
something like that with a basin formulation okay so this is called the

359
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:35,540
formulation okay so this is called the style version is called the belt

360
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,940
style version is called the belt smoothing okay where anyone taking the

361
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,830
smoothing okay where anyone taking the MLE estimate we take a weighted average

362
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,980
MLE estimate we take a weighted average of the Emily estimate or diagonally

363
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,160
of the Emily estimate or diagonally consists and also lambda times of cake

364
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,730
consists and also lambda times of cake where this is the unit of frequencies

365
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,000
where this is the unit of frequencies which is NK / yeah all right so let's

366
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,210
which is NK / yeah all right so let's take how we get the measure model for

367
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,740
take how we get the measure model for this let me put all of this thing up

368
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,400
this let me put all of this thing up actually this is very simple but assumes

369
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,580
actually this is very simple but assumes that you know something about different

370
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:10,180
that you know something about different distributions as prior so this is the

371
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:18,490
distributions as prior so this is the situation and this is the matrix a that

372
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,440
situation and this is the matrix a that is being stirred by all my observations

373
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,350
is being stirred by all my observations so that's why you see these links like

374
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,160
so that's why you see these links like that and each of this is the first in

375
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,840
that and each of this is the first in the a matrix so if you think this will

376
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,700
the a matrix so if you think this will give me the probabilities to transition

377
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,720
give me the probabilities to transition from one to state to state one from one

378
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,700
from one to state to state one from one to clear from one two three one two

379
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,460
to clear from one two three one two three etc so the sum of these things is

380
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,490
three etc so the sum of these things is equal to 1 okay

381
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,040
equal to 1 okay so then this will give you the

382
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:54,790
so then this will give you the transition from you know the one - okay

383
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:58,810
transition from you know the one - okay and so I'm going to take the pitch of

384
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:06,250
and so I'm going to take the pitch of this Rose amethyst and then I'm going to

385
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,220
this Rose amethyst and then I'm going to do is I am going to put a on each of

386
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,950
do is I am going to put a on each of these rows okay and this one is going to

387
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,940
these rows okay and this one is going to be the declare distribution that looks

388
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:21,310
be the declare distribution that looks the way that you see here the distance

389
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,710
the way that you see here the distance basically from silty clay have been

390
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,320
basically from silty clay have been written in an interesting way where I

391
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,660
written in an interesting way where I have the time you know it's not from the

392
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,970
have the time you know it's not from the details but basically a 0 comes

393
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,340
details but basically a 0 comes everywhere then I have M 0 2 and carry

394
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,100
everywhere then I have M 0 2 and carry so this is if you can take the mean of

395
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,320
so this is if you can take the mean of this declare distribution the mean comes

396
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,830
this declare distribution the mean comes to the N ok and the strength of which is

397
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:48,840
to the N ok and the strength of which is defined by this coefficient of 0 okay so

398
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,130
defined by this coefficient of 0 okay so so

399
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:57,990
let's see what this is going to do some of these min satisfies the stomach

400
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:03,210
of these min satisfies the stomach encase has to be cooked one alright so

401
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:09,570
encase has to be cooked one alright so this is the prior and I claim that the

402
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:14,010
this is the prior and I claim that the posterior for its you know I can say and

403
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,140
posterior for its you know I can say and I remind you it's a healthy purge a

404
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,940
I remind you it's a healthy purge a contains the transition probabilities

405
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,290
contains the transition probabilities from J to 1 to J 2 to 20 to 3 right all

406
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:29,550
from J to 1 to J 2 to 20 to 3 right all of the things education you know this

407
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:34,310
of the things education you know this chest do you remember what time he has

408
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:37,500
chest do you remember what time he has so he can look at the analytical

409
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,000
so he can look at the analytical expression which a for alpha J 1 so the

410
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,030
expression which a for alpha J 1 so the terminal for J 1 is going to be sum

411
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:50,090
terminal for J 1 is going to be sum alpha G want some power what's the power

412
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,100


413
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:56,040
you guys to the computer power of youth we have a distribution of does it look

414
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,440
we have a distribution of does it look like you can take for distribution some

415
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,200
like you can take for distribution some parameters theta 1 theta 2 etc you're

416
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:10,590
parameters theta 1 theta 2 etc you're going to have people line to what power

417
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:10,600


418
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:18,450
- this - swan and mythic a it would be if they came to this power minus 1 right

419
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:22,889
if they came to this power minus 1 right can you suppress with the likelihood

420
00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:24,330
can you suppress with the likelihood that had the same form that we had

421
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,749
that had the same form that we had before that they were the parameters to

422
00:26:27,749 --> 00:26:32,299
before that they were the parameters to some power you remember the likelihood I

423
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,039
some power you remember the likelihood I don't want to go back 20 slides all

424
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:42,690
don't want to go back 20 slides all right

425
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:42,700


426
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,360
you remember

427
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:47,370


428
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,990
so you can see now the right to declare distribution is the appropriate

429
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:54,260
distribution is the appropriate conjugate prior alright so you multiply

430
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,260
conjugate prior alright so you multiply stall here with I'd say to some power

431
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,350
stall here with I'd say to some power and here with a educate some power and

432
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:04,010
and here with a educate some power and lower case and object this will give you

433
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:07,690
lower case and object this will give you a very clear prior base okay so the

434
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,710
a very clear prior base okay so the event of the day the collab liquid is

435
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,150
event of the day the collab liquid is declared distribution if the priors in

436
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,980
declared distribution if the priors in the liquor distribution the posterior

437
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,330
the liquor distribution the posterior will come to be a digital distribution

438
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:20,960
will come to be a digital distribution and the posterior we have the same

439
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,490
and the posterior we have the same promise the prior with updated

440
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,000
promise the prior with updated parameters and this will be the form of

441
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,020
parameters and this will be the form of the the operator will be the

442
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,950
the the operator will be the distribution with parameters of a zero

443
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:40,550
distribution with parameters of a zero times M the comes from the prior NJ not

444
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,640
times M the comes from the prior NJ not the scalar and Jerry NJ is the vector of

445
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,940
the scalar and Jerry NJ is the vector of the time to transition from TJ to state

446
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,390
the time to transition from TJ to state one from state a to state two and NJ to

447
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,160
one from state a to state two and NJ to take care okay

448
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,890
take care okay so the posterior distribution looks it's

449
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,810
so the posterior distribution looks it's not going close from the way that this

450
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:07,460
not going close from the way that this is this basically to do a better

451
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,670
is this basically to do a better estimation and prediction for the

452
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,180
estimation and prediction for the language model that's one thing and

453
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:17,690
language model that's one thing and secondly how do you actually can go and

454
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,120
secondly how do you actually can go and ask you something about that for 0 name

455
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,660
ask you something about that for 0 name okay so how do you find this parameter

456
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:30,940
okay so how do you find this parameter seen in the prior but make sure

457
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:30,950


458
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:37,640
we reduce the prestige remain a JK so each of this is that the declared

459
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,960
each of this is that the declared distribution we're going to use the

460
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,850
distribution we're going to use the posterior min and the posterior mean

461
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:45,890
posterior min and the posterior mean basically for the this distribution if

462
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,140
basically for the this distribution if you take each of the partitions the K

463
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,540
you take each of the partitions the K partition it will be M say k plus alpha

464
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:58,820
partition it will be M say k plus alpha 0 MK / MJ suppose dinner and okay so

465
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,120
0 MK / MJ suppose dinner and okay so into the trade is the frequency of

466
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,810
into the trade is the frequency of transition from J to K times n J this is

467
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,840
transition from J to K times n J this is what we came with family estimation plus

468
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,530
what we came with family estimation plus 1 plus 0 times MK and J plus alpha 0 and

469
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,350
1 plus 0 times MK and J plus alpha 0 and I can write this expression like this

470
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:19,850
I can write this expression like this for lambda J is alpha 0 / MJ plus alpha

471
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,420
for lambda J is alpha 0 / MJ plus alpha 0 so basically this approximation that

472
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,180
0 so basically this approximation that people introduced before it comes out to

473
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,860
people introduced before it comes out to be actually the posterior min when it

474
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,860
be actually the posterior min when it uses very clear prior on the rolls of

475
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:37,220
uses very clear prior on the rolls of the transition matrix a JK okay so the

476
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:44,120
the transition matrix a JK okay so the first evening because the 0 the

477
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,490
first evening because the 0 the procedure mean really is the transition

478
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:51,290
procedure mean really is the transition probability from state a to state K ok

479
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,520
probability from state a to state K ok so this integration it is defined

480
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,920
so this integration it is defined exclusively in terms of the prior

481
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,100
exclusively in terms of the prior strength of for 0 and also the number of

482
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,580
strength of for 0 and also the number of time she worked on on stage a on the

483
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,150
time she worked on on stage a on the word shape

484
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:08,160


485
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:17,300
okay so the question is rep all pioneers going to be okay and that is not a

486
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:28,400
going to be okay and that is not a trivial problem so I'm going to if it's

487
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,050
trivial problem so I'm going to if it's something that I know it somehow might

488
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:39,620
something that I know it somehow might slide in the okay it comes to be the

489
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,990
slide in the okay it comes to be the same thing at the end of the day the

490
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:47,060
same thing at the end of the day the likelihood alright remember the steps we

491
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,450
likelihood alright remember the steps we assume that each hole is independent of

492
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,780
assume that each hole is independent of each other so the likelihood basically

493
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,370
each other so the likelihood basically is the product of all the rows of this

494
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,630
is the product of all the rows of this interesting relationship potential

495
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,070
interesting relationship potential should somebody transmit from where this

496
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:10,280
should somebody transmit from where this is coming I were very happy

497
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:10,290


498
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:20,720
so remember we multiply all right we multiply and then we got a posterior

499
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,180
multiply and then we got a posterior that he was also at the clear

500
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,520
that he was also at the clear distribution and this Bank was really an

501
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:35,380
distribution and this Bank was really an j plus alpha so did this formula come

502
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:35,390


503
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:41,210
declare distribution we multiply with the dirichlet prior and then we set the

504
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,300
the dirichlet prior and then we set the reason the posterior is a data flow

505
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:48,230
reason the posterior is a data flow distribution as well so this I can tell

506
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,600
distribution as well so this I can tell you it reminds me very much the

507
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,520
you it reminds me very much the normalizing factor of the delay

508
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,880
normalizing factor of the delay distribution she wanted to have 1 over

509
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,770
distribution she wanted to have 1 over the Aquacade this is really the

510
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,980
the Aquacade this is really the normalizing question of what

511
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:09,170
normalizing question of what distributional problem remember we have

512
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,420
distributional problem remember we have the likelihood we assimilate a prior

513
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,510
the likelihood we assimilate a prior than spirit-led so for this term in the

514
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:19,730
than spirit-led so for this term in the denominator came from

515
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:19,740


516
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:29,120
that's the normalizing factor with mr. Bishop

517
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,130


518
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:41,029
so it's the normalizing factor of the prior right and to normalize it you have

519
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:44,900
prior right and to normalize it you have to multiply and divide by this factor so

520
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,640
to multiply and divide by this factor so one of our best times whatever you have

521
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,529
one of our best times whatever you have as a problem will give you a declared

522
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:50,510
as a problem will give you a declared posterior and this would be the

523
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:55,100
posterior and this would be the normalization factor to the power so the

524
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,080
normalization factor to the power so the product over J a father and also the

525
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,450
product over J a father and also the transition matrix of this ratio will

526
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,279
transition matrix of this ratio will basically give you explicitly the

527
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,100
basically give you explicitly the marginal likelihood and what you can do

528
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,260
marginal likelihood and what you can do is if you are interested to actually now

529
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:11,120
is if you are interested to actually now go and compute this parameters for

530
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,070
go and compute this parameters for example you know what you can do is you

531
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,680
example you know what you can do is you can do an optimization problem and you

532
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,669
can do an optimization problem and you can find the actual calculations semi

533
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,770
can find the actual calculations semi analytically basically this paper by

534
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,960
analytically basically this paper by Mincha using this expression to compute

535
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:35,000
Mincha using this expression to compute these parameters to this expression the

536
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,060
these parameters to this expression the posterior comes our political transition

537
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,480
posterior comes our political transition matrix to be declared distribution so

538
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,330
matrix to be declared distribution so the transition from J to K has this mean

539
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,649
the transition from J to K has this mean value and this mean value is the

540
00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:51,020
value and this mean value is the weighted average basically of the

541
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,320
weighted average basically of the diagram frequencies to collide and this

542
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,680
diagram frequencies to collide and this template that has to do with the prior

543
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,080
template that has to do with the prior now I remind you but if you do this

544
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,450
now I remind you but if you do this empirically people will take this

545
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,779
empirically people will take this coefficient MK to be how many times you

546
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:07,450
coefficient MK to be how many times you have the world carrying the data search

547
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:12,230
have the world carrying the data search alright so here's X ability because NK

548
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,379
alright so here's X ability because NK is defined in terms of the prior so the

549
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:21,159
is defined in terms of the prior so the question is what do you take as MK so

550
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:21,169


551
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:25,760
anything what it saved look at this equation here and it makes

552
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,190
look at this equation here and it makes an K is proportional today such that and

553
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,260
an K is proportional today such that and JK greater than zero can you tell me

554
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,100
JK greater than zero can you tell me what this change

555
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,240
what this change towards take us m'kay what noticing all

556
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,870
towards take us m'kay what noticing all the times you see the words a what how

557
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,120
the times you see the words a what how many times you transition to the web K

558
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,160
many times you transition to the web K for many other words a okay because in

559
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,780
for many other words a okay because in essence this is an entropy I have and

560
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,940
essence this is an entropy I have and how many times you say given war okay

561
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:07,420
how many times you say given war okay and there is an example in Memphis UNC

562
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,300
and there is an example in Memphis UNC okay and you know this that always comes

563
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,170
okay and you know this that always comes after you

564
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,530
after you so if you need to find the transition

565
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,470
so if you need to find the transition probabilities basically can give the

566
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:22,180
probabilities basically can give the same thing and see something you know

567
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,040
same thing and see something you know genius comes up to review all right and

568
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,640
genius comes up to review all right and you will notice the times that you see

569
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,380
you will notice the times that you see appear in this model it's about the

570
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,470
appear in this model it's about the thing okay eleven times is the same but

571
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:43,880
thing okay eleven times is the same but utilizations language you just you could

572
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,520
utilizations language you just you could let you etcetera you know see you

573
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:52,250
let you etcetera you know see you whatever but in this model into account

574
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,620
whatever but in this model into account that this transition probability is the

575
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,650
that this transition probability is the weighted average of these random

576
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,130
weighted average of these random frequencies and how many times you

577
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:04,640
frequencies and how many times you transition to the word k okay defined by

578
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,040
transition to the word k okay defined by this definition does this model performs

579
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,080
this definition does this model performs way better found the any other sort of

580
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:19,820
way better found the any other sort of known estimate for for m'kay if I

581
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,250
known estimate for for m'kay if I understand is the basically non

582
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,890
understand is the basically non parametric model and usually this non

583
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,530
parametric model and usually this non parametric models use practical

584
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,900
parametric models use practical techniques so you can think you know

585
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,250
techniques so you can think you know since you are interested in model the

586
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,660
since you are interested in model the transition from one world to another

587
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,570
transition from one world to another this you can think of this this time so

588
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,370
this you can think of this this time so you can use ideas from sequence to

589
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,980
you can use ideas from sequence to Montecarlo to do that

590
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,650
Montecarlo to do that into service no parametric methods but I

591
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,820
into service no parametric methods but I know by reducing I can go back here I

592
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,640
know by reducing I can go back here I have I'm using the declared distribution

593
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,920
have I'm using the declared distribution as a prior their prior you know what it

594
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,280
as a prior their prior you know what it is that they reflect process and I don't

595
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,810
is that they reflect process and I don't know kind of you will do a profit from

596
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,240
know kind of you will do a profit from this what's the difference not

597
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,940
this what's the difference not automatically but if I go from this

598
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,430
automatically but if I go from this distribution to the clip process what

599
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,710
distribution to the clip process what you know what did the process in general

600
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,870
you know what did the process in general will allow me to do that this particular

601
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:25,960
will allow me to do that this particular model would not allow me anybody knows

602
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:25,970


603
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:33,760
so in this case right I have transitions from J to state 0 to K right in

604
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,410
from J to state 0 to K right in different postures I'm gonna be able to

605
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:39,930
different postures I'm gonna be able to have transitions to handle states

606
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:39,940


607
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:49,450
Antony okay so that way worst of you have not seen with the accountant in the

608
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,849
have not seen with the accountant in the private market you know because you have

609
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:55,839
private market you know because you have transitions to everything okay but I've

610
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,109
transitions to everything okay but I've now told it will not allow you to do

611
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:03,550
now told it will not allow you to do this so the raclette process is you know

612
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,680
this so the raclette process is you know that's why we call it a non parametric

613
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,270
that's why we call it a non parametric model because effectively you have

614
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,280
model because effectively you have infinite parameters to define this model

615
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,120
infinite parameters to define this model so if you are interested the actually

616
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,790
so if you are interested the actually the world of tech from Oxford basically

617
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,520
the world of tech from Oxford basically is the one that has produced one of the

618
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,220
is the one that has produced one of the best language models basically using the

619
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:29,509
best language models basically using the repair process priors from doing that

620
00:38:29,509 --> 00:38:29,519


621
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:44,659
I mentioned something else here with coefficients 1 1 1 1 the you know what

622
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:46,579
coefficients 1 1 1 1 the you know what is going to happen at the end of the day

623
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:52,370
is going to happen at the end of the day on this estimate because that everybody

624
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,409
on this estimate because that everybody does and the girls you know it is your

625
00:38:54,409 --> 00:38:56,659
does and the girls you know it is your series empirically written in a lots of

626
00:38:56,659 --> 00:39:01,689
series empirically written in a lots of machine learning books so the estimate

627
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:06,979
machine learning books so the estimate AJ Clary was m JK / MJ so if my data

628
00:39:06,979 --> 00:39:11,419
AJ Clary was m JK / MJ so if my data layer has coefficients 1 1 1 1 ok all

629
00:39:11,419 --> 00:39:14,149
layer has coefficients 1 1 1 1 ok all was what actually this thing is going to

630
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:19,039
was what actually this thing is going to come to be what is this what will happen

631
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:21,859
come to be what is this what will happen to the mean of digital prior with

632
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:30,480
to the mean of digital prior with Kristin's want

633
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:30,490


634
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:36,620
so it will come out that this quotation here would be 1 and this would be 1

635
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,760
here would be 1 and this would be 1 subjectively what you will be doing in

636
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,040
subjectively what you will be doing in computing the posterior mean you will be

637
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,880
computing the posterior mean you will be adding the quantity 1 all the empirical

638
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,890
adding the quantity 1 all the empirical cows

639
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:49,079
cows so if one word for example doesn't exist

640
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,079
so if one word for example doesn't exist a term in the training data set you will

641
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,260
a term in the training data set you will get 1 there so the transition from J to

642
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,250
get 1 there so the transition from J to that one will not be 0 you're not gonna

643
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,630
that one will not be 0 you're not gonna get anything worth it because the

644
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,970
get anything worth it because the organization that prior will usually

645
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,870
organization that prior will usually have a transition to an award

646
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,900
have a transition to an award okay and this graph would let me see

647
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,730
okay and this graph would let me see what the name is and plus 1 or something

648
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:21,990
what the name is and plus 1 or something this is very typical

649
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,000


650
00:40:22,000 --> 00:41:06,780
somewhere I remember well is with me okay so this is the mouthing okay so

651
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,150
okay so this is the mouthing okay so here we have an evolution of the space

652
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,430
here we have an evolution of the space the way that you see here these are my

653
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,339
the way that you see here these are my exist this or the observations they have

654
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,620
exist this or the observations they have and you know the purpose of introducing

655
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,900
and you know the purpose of introducing sort of this length and representations

656
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:24,450
sort of this length and representations is because it allows us to take very

657
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,130
is because it allows us to take very complex dependencies between the

658
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:29,099
complex dependencies between the external okay so even though given let's

659
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:34,530
external okay so even though given let's say this this observation and

660
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,000
say this this observation and observation are independent of each

661
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:43,250
observation are independent of each other by integrator resist how okay

662
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,140
other by integrator resist how okay lexis depend on each other so this is a

663
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,480
lexis depend on each other so this is a much more complicated model than the

664
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,329
much more complicated model than the Markov model even though conditioned on

665
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:53,660
Markov model even though conditioned on Z you have conditioned you know this GI

666
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,300
Z you have conditioned you know this GI independence relations that simplify the

667
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,559
independence relations that simplify the problem okay so let me just write the

668
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:03,089
problem okay so let me just write the probability distribution is going to

669
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:06,660
probability distribution is going to look like the joint of action three okay

670
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,089
look like the joint of action three okay is again the probability of being in

671
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:11,910
is again the probability of being in state C 1 we have the transition

672
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,500
state C 1 we have the transition probability exactly as in the markov

673
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,309
probability exactly as in the markov model and then we have the observation

674
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:20,430
model and then we have the observation probabilities so at this time the

675
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:25,490
probabilities so at this time the probability of X and given Zn sorry hmm

676
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,830
probability of X and given Zn sorry hmm model

677
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,900
model we will take the state Z to be discreet

678
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,810
we will take the state Z to be discreet but the observation sex can be anything

679
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:35,290
but the observation sex can be anything you want to so it can be - them can be

680
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,540
you want to so it can be - them can be multi no me can be any sort of

681
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,900
multi no me can be any sort of distribution if you make this have this

682
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,000
distribution if you make this have this position to be Gaussian and this to be a

683
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,030
position to be Gaussian and this to be a Gaussian then you get in here

684
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,820
Gaussian then you get in here Gaussian models basically that we will

685
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,250
Gaussian models basically that we will see later on and from there if you can

686
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,320
see later on and from there if you can get a year similar to Kalman filtering

687
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,810
get a year similar to Kalman filtering but right now we're going to take that

688
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,900
but right now we're going to take that this is a discrete distribution this can

689
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,910
this is a discrete distribution this can be we leave it on the earth so it can be

690
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:11,109
be we leave it on the earth so it can be anything we want we want to alright

691
00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:11,119


692
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:18,130
so extremely similar to a Gaussian mixture model okay

693
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:20,230
mixture model okay the only difference so imagine that we

694
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,289
the only difference so imagine that we have this liquid distance right of the

695
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:26,819
have this liquid distance right of the mixture quotations that tells you when

696
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:29,950
mixture quotations that tells you when you know so let's say the parameter of

697
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,710
you know so let's say the parameter of XT given the state is a Gaussian all

698
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,140
XT given the state is a Gaussian all right and maybe in our mixture model we

699
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,529
right and maybe in our mixture model we have three different gaussian right so k

700
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:40,180
have three different gaussian right so k equal 1 2 or 3

701
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,180
equal 1 2 or 3 so if your sister is a data set that

702
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,079
so if your sister is a data set that comes from three different gaussian okay

703
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,380
comes from three different gaussian okay but incident models is a little more

704
00:43:50,380 --> 00:44:37,180
but incident models is a little more complicated because z1 and z2 will again

705
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,789
complicated because z1 and z2 will again point to the childís Gaussian but won't

706
00:44:39,789 --> 00:44:41,710
point to the childís Gaussian but won't survive with three you know what the

707
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,749
survive with three you know what the state trip is gonna be on this ride the

708
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:46,509
state trip is gonna be on this ride the Gaussian so you start taking samples

709
00:44:46,509 --> 00:44:48,940
Gaussian so you start taking samples from this until all so why have you find

710
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,460
from this until all so why have you find yourself on this Gaussian so what's the

711
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,720
yourself on this Gaussian so what's the difference of this from a Gaussian

712
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,019
difference of this from a Gaussian mixture the difference is very simple

713
00:44:56,019 --> 00:44:58,269
mixture the difference is very simple that the state are basically now a

714
00:44:58,269 --> 00:45:04,960
that the state are basically now a Markov chain if you sample next depends

715
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,769
Markov chain if you sample next depends what state they were before all right so

716
00:45:08,769 --> 00:45:11,109
what state they were before all right so in many ways this is very similar to a

717
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:13,410
in many ways this is very similar to a diversion mixed model behind

718
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,410
diversion mixed model behind without this all right I connected

719
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:18,660
without this all right I connected through the Markovian property basically

720
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,690
through the Markovian property basically you know the transition of the

721
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:25,109
you know the transition of the permeability of GI from given CI - Juan

722
00:45:25,109 --> 00:45:28,650
permeability of GI from given CI - Juan what you see here is in constraints on

723
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:33,059
what you see here is in constraints on how we go from you know from one state

724
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:33,660
how we go from you know from one state to another

725
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,660
to another can you tell me if I want to generate

726
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:41,549
can you tell me if I want to generate this data given historical time for this

727
00:45:41,549 --> 00:45:43,680
this data given historical time for this distribution can somebody give me an

728
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,890
distribution can somebody give me an idea if I want to to stop generating

729
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:51,089
idea if I want to to stop generating this picture here and it's this

730
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:52,920
this picture here and it's this observation modest is a direction with

731
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,289
observation modest is a direction with its own mean and variance how are you

732
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:57,000
its own mean and variance how are you going to generate the picture looking at

733
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,460
going to generate the picture looking at this distribution

734
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:01,079
this distribution what's restless I'm going to look like

735
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:05,039
what's restless I'm going to look like to generate data the way that you seen

736
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:10,440
to generate data the way that you seen the showing the picture so how are you

737
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,510
the showing the picture so how are you going to generate the observations that

738
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:17,700
going to generate the observations that we saw there from gaussians you can see

739
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,859
we saw there from gaussians you can see here so what do we do what's the first

740
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:25,210
here so what do we do what's the first step

741
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:25,220


742
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:29,540
from this distribution of g1 the initial State

743
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:39,170
State alright I got it what's next alright the

744
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:43,460
alright I got it what's next alright the next thing is can we sample actual right

745
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,380
next thing is can we sample actual right the answer is yes we can sell furniture

746
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,000
the answer is yes we can sell furniture on the given is d---rom from this

747
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,610
on the given is d---rom from this probability okay what's next

748
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,830
probability okay what's next we have a sample of zero and now also

749
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,570
we have a sample of zero and now also given the sample whatever we gonna do

750
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:59,270
given the sample whatever we gonna do samples it to now giving us the three we

751
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:01,820
samples it to now giving us the three we can sample it do etc so mister you get

752
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,000
can sample it do etc so mister you get this picture that you see on the left

753
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,290
this picture that you see on the left okay so it is a very exactly like a

754
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,000
okay so it is a very exactly like a Gaussian mixture the only difference is

755
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,890
Gaussian mixture the only difference is in a Gaussian mixture you don't have

756
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:15,380
in a Gaussian mixture you don't have this transition probability which we

757
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:24,440
this transition probability which we have here okay because we're running out

758
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:37,910
have here okay because we're running out of time if I can't pee

759
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:37,920


760
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,860
nope I don't see it I'm gonna have to I have to use your imagination now because

761
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:50,069
have to use your imagination now because who knows what try this now okay

762
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:50,079


763
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:57,339
it was made that I can write the initial probability of C 1 because eventually

764
00:47:57,339 --> 00:47:59,020
probability of C 1 because eventually we're going to be interesting to do

765
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,030
we're going to be interesting to do influence of the parameters in this

766
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:03,130
influence of the parameters in this distribution I can write it like that

767
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,290
distribution I can write it like that so you can do something exactly what

768
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,530
so you can do something exactly what this equation gives me on the bottom so

769
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,690
this equation gives me on the bottom so I'm assuming here that the states D 1 is

770
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:21,019
I'm assuming here that the states D 1 is discrete fixed K stage so that is PI K

771
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:21,029


772
00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:28,999
is the probability that that would say one I am on what state okay and where is

773
00:48:28,999 --> 00:48:30,620
one I am on what state okay and where is this coming because this discrete

774
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:34,569
this coming because this discrete variable Z the aleni

775
00:48:34,569 --> 00:48:34,579


776
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:45,259
so I'm gonna get okay cheer win when Z K is equal to R I mean I say the first

777
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:48,319
is equal to R I mean I say the first risk video I should not have it here but

778
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:52,969
risk video I should not have it here but oh hey the first verse 32 no actually

779
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:53,539
oh hey the first verse 32 no actually you know what

780
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:55,789
you know what this should not be an i what should this

781
00:48:55,789 --> 00:49:02,239
this should not be an i what should this be right so when the state you know I'm

782
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:08,149
be right so when the state you know I'm one dataset here right when 0 C is from

783
00:49:08,149 --> 00:49:12,259
one dataset here right when 0 C is from state that's a notation like this what's

784
00:49:12,259 --> 00:49:15,529
state that's a notation like this what's new 1 K is equal to 1 okay so when z1 k

785
00:49:15,529 --> 00:49:18,380
new 1 K is equal to 1 okay so when z1 k equal to 1 this will give me DK and all

786
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,359
equal to 1 this will give me DK and all the other terms we have an exponent 0 so

787
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:22,669
the other terms we have an exponent 0 so would be equal to 1 so I get basically

788
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:26,949
would be equal to 1 so I get basically the distance equal to PI K all right

789
00:49:26,949 --> 00:49:32,310
the distance equal to PI K all right does this make sense

790
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:32,320


791
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,140
alright this exactly basically what we had for the Markov chain right so

792
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,910
had for the Markov chain right so there's nothing different this is the

793
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:44,070
there's nothing different this is the transition from J to K and J in k k

794
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:46,230
transition from J to K and J in k k dimensional right they can take K States

795
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:49,430
dimensional right they can take K States and on the experiences to make this

796
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:53,580
and on the experiences to make this explicit if I have GN minus 1 J this is

797
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:57,060
explicit if I have GN minus 1 J this is equal to 1 when the N minus 1 state is

798
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:00,690
equal to 1 when the N minus 1 state is on J status and this one a time step

799
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:04,380
on J status and this one a time step then I'm alakay alright so if this is

800
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,900
then I'm alakay alright so if this is the case the exponents equal to 1 and

801
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,680
the case the exponents equal to 1 and this give me a JK the rest gives me is

802
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,200
this give me a JK the rest gives me is doing exponent so I get a contribution

803
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,110
doing exponent so I get a contribution of 1 so nothing changes

804
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:19,890
of 1 so nothing changes ok so here's what we're interested we're

805
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,320
ok so here's what we're interested we're interested to protonate for the hidden

806
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,230
interested to protonate for the hidden market one of the dispositions and also

807
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,990
market one of the dispositions and also the history probabilities pi K potential

808
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,640
the history probabilities pi K potential and if you're introducing observation

809
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,370
and if you're introducing observation love them and this observation model we

810
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,960
love them and this observation model we have the chain parameters and we need to

811
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,430
have the chain parameters and we need to compute this as well ok and you know we

812
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:39,900
compute this as well ok and you know we can consider several different choices

813
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,750
can consider several different choices it's lethal for the slides but you can

814
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:47,300
it's lethal for the slides but you can imagine if you are on state K let's say

815
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:51,080
imagine if you are on state K let's say then if this coefficients can be PKA and

816
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,640
then if this coefficients can be PKA and this will be the chosen correspondent

817
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,810
this will be the chosen correspondent about k-state

818
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:59,310
about k-state sharing some mineral child by carrying

819
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:01,170
sharing some mineral child by carrying that's carrying some variants also fits

820
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:03,120
that's carrying some variants also fits all and we're going to have to compute

821
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,040
all and we're going to have to compute all the means and the variances of the

822
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,050
all the means and the variances of the observation model for each of the k

823
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:09,150
observation model for each of the k space but michigan if this is the

824
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:11,090
space but michigan if this is the discrete model can be a multi newly

825
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:13,740
discrete model can be a multi newly distribution so we have to calculate the

826
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,750
distribution so we have to calculate the probabilities of the different states as

827
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:19,530
probabilities of the different states as well I'm supervising this in general

828
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:26,850
well I'm supervising this in general like that ok so so tell me what do we

829
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,730
like that ok so so tell me what do we have here

830
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,620
have here so I'm looking at the emission

831
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,420
so I'm looking at the emission probabilities this we observe a chinois

832
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:36,660
probabilities this we observe a chinois deluxe step 10 all right and it

833
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,050
deluxe step 10 all right and it next scent comes from this model this

834
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:43,590
next scent comes from this model this probability papyrus ink is DNA and DNA

835
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:47,490
probability papyrus ink is DNA and DNA equal to now happens when a step and

836
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:50,580
equal to now happens when a step and almost if I would say I mean on state K

837
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:54,660
almost if I would say I mean on state K so if I'm on spent cave is equal to one

838
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,630
so if I'm on spent cave is equal to one so the parameters basically that define

839
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,730
so the parameters basically that define the observation models of the parameters

840
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:02,660
the observation models of the parameters PK and this is what we need to observe

841
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:05,100
PK and this is what we need to observe what we need to complete basically what

842
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,310
what we need to complete basically what we do Emily you're measuring current

843
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:09,320


844
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,010
[Applause]

845
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:13,020


846
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:18,510
distribution at both the observed variables and I call all of this

847
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,000
variables and I call all of this variable sex so from next one to X

848
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,260
variable sex so from next one to X capital T and G 1 2 G capital in your

849
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,510
capital T and G 1 2 G capital in your subscript a is the initial probability

850
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:30,000
subscript a is the initial probability of this transitions of the state and the

851
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,400
of this transitions of the state and the observation model 3d panel it is

852
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,350
observation model 3d panel it is difficult as you can see from what we

853
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,600
difficult as you can see from what we have seen on a Markov model here where

854
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:42,290
have seen on a Markov model here where is this a difficult problem

855
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:42,300


856
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:46,190
you can open the left hand side what is different from what we had in the market

857
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:51,850
different from what we had in the market Walden

858
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:51,860


859
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:57,040
you remember in a Markov chain we had the likelihood of the observation sex

860
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,840
the likelihood of the observation sex but now here I have the joint likelihood

861
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,050
but now here I have the joint likelihood of X and Z given the parameters and what

862
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:03,780
of X and Z given the parameters and what is different here

863
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:09,190
is different here Benghazi we don't know this tears on

864
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:12,460
Benghazi we don't know this tears on itself so basically this joint look like

865
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,230
itself so basically this joint look like it would it looks nice

866
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:17,050
it would it looks nice it looks exactly like an operating model

867
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,540
it looks exactly like an operating model but unfortunately the states they have

868
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,760
but unfortunately the states they have not known so we cannot go and do an

869
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,360
not known so we cannot go and do an Emily on this you will not work right

870
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:27,370


871
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:44,980
because it looks very this is very easy to look at and manipulate but we don't

872
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,900
to look at and manipulate but we don't know what saves so let's go to slide

873
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,260
know what saves so let's go to slide undred 70 and see on how we can compute

874
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:57,370
undred 70 and see on how we can compute all these unknown parameters hmm

875
00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:00,730
all these unknown parameters hmm so that we covered in last spring and

876
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:03,160
so that we covered in last spring and I'm going to review it basically in the

877
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,080
I'm going to review it basically in the context of the hmm

878
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:23,350
context of the hmm is optimized maximized not the hood the

879
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:25,210
is optimized maximized not the hood the joint of likelihood of the observations

880
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:27,220
joint of likelihood of the observations of the hidden body most but the

881
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,830
of the hidden body most but the expectation of the joint of likelihood

882
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,360
expectation of the joint of likelihood with respect to the posterior

883
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,970
with respect to the posterior distribution of Z given live the waist

884
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:37,630
distribution of Z given live the waist of self and of course the posterior

885
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:40,690
of self and of course the posterior distribution of derivatives erections is

886
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:42,370
distribution of derivatives erections is not now because we don't know the

887
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:44,620
not now because we don't know the parameters so what we're gonna do is

888
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,840
parameters so what we're gonna do is we're gonna try to Eternity we update

889
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,110
we're gonna try to Eternity we update the parameters as follows we're going to

890
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:53,290
the parameters as follows we're going to take some previous iteration takes

891
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,780
take some previous iteration takes department some values and then try to

892
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,660
department some values and then try to compute this for strain of

893
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,660
compute this for strain of the necks with a barometer speaks then

894
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:05,250
the necks with a barometer speaks then compute the expectation of the join of

895
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:07,680
compute the expectation of the join of livelihood and not as this parameters

896
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,440
livelihood and not as this parameters here are parameters that are known and

897
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,559
here are parameters that are known and I'm going to update so first I'm going

898
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:16,230
I'm going to update so first I'm going to compute this expectation using this

899
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,660
to compute this expectation using this posterior that is approximated using

900
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,609
posterior that is approximated using some the previous iteration of the

901
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:23,190
some the previous iteration of the parameters and then once I compute this

902
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,770
parameters and then once I compute this I am going to maximize this with respect

903
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:31,020
I am going to maximize this with respect to parameters theta okay supposedly I am

904
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,299
to parameters theta okay supposedly I am going to abuse the complexity that has

905
00:55:33,299 --> 00:55:36,270
going to abuse the complexity that has to do with the fact that I don't know Z

906
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:39,720
to do with the fact that I don't know Z by reducing the joining applied the

907
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,020
by reducing the joining applied the affections G but somehow transforming

908
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,089
affections G but somehow transforming the optimization and iterative

909
00:55:45,089 --> 00:55:47,220
the optimization and iterative optimization problem who have worked

910
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,990
optimization problem who have worked with the expectation of the Journal of

911
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:51,720
with the expectation of the Journal of likelihood expectation with respect to

912
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,720
likelihood expectation with respect to this posterior and somehow it ray all

913
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,059
this posterior and somehow it ray all the parameters theta and at the same

914
00:55:57,059 --> 00:56:02,130
the parameters theta and at the same time updating this posterior of Z makes

915
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:02,940
time updating this posterior of Z makes a little sense

916
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,640
a little sense so this is sort of the final

917
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,589
so this is sort of the final expectation-maximization algorithm to

918
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:09,599
expectation-maximization algorithm to ensure the problems we have parameters

919
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:15,470
ensure the problems we have parameters and you have some hidden variables right

920
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:15,480


921
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,710
but somehow I'm working directly with the journal of livelihood is a much

922
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:24,690
the journal of livelihood is a much easier proposition than working with the

923
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,460
easier proposition than working with the likelihood effects I mean you can

924
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:28,680
likelihood effects I mean you can imagine here if you put destinations

925
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,109
imagine here if you put destinations they dialect on this distribution this

926
00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:32,579
they dialect on this distribution this is computationally intractable you

927
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:35,370
is computationally intractable you cannot do anything about okay you know

928
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:37,230
cannot do anything about okay you know in this field you come up with Paniagua

929
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,809
in this field you come up with Paniagua later but this is especially when you

930
00:56:39,809 --> 00:56:41,490
later but this is especially when you take the long this is a very easy

931
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:43,950
take the long this is a very easy distribution taking the average with

932
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:45,870
distribution taking the average with respect to this posterior is going to be

933
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:48,480
respect to this posterior is going to be easy and the key thing here is compute

934
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,640
easy and the key thing here is compute this posterior in tentatively using an

935
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,260
this posterior in tentatively using an onset of the variables of these

936
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,990
onset of the variables of these parameters and then when you do this

937
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:57,660
parameters and then when you do this computation of this quantity Q of demise

938
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:00,500
computation of this quantity Q of demise with respect to theta then come back and

939
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,080
with respect to theta then come back and they dressed very compute vest take

940
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,180
they dressed very compute vest take another optimization with respect to

941
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:09,110
another optimization with respect to theta so this lips want us to compute

942
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:11,780
theta so this lips want us to compute this expectation that base that second

943
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:15,050
this expectation that base that second much much respect to theta and hopefully

944
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:17,660
much much respect to theta and hopefully you will achieve some convergence in a

945
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:32,870
you will achieve some convergence in a few duration we discuss you know for

946
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:35,060
few duration we discuss you know for change them and we did this with a

947
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:41,890
change them and we did this with a junction tree etc okay it comes out when

948
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:45,290
junction tree etc okay it comes out when you calculate this expectation of the

949
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:47,330
you calculate this expectation of the joint of likelihood you're gonna need

950
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,910
joint of likelihood you're gonna need some sufficient statistics and those

951
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:52,370
some sufficient statistics and those sufficient statistics basically will

952
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:57,020
sufficient statistics basically will abilities that we have computed from the

953
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,120
abilities that we have computed from the forward and backward passing masters

954
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,820
forward and backward passing masters algorithms so the sufficient statistics

955
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:05,320
algorithms so the sufficient statistics that we will need is this probability

956
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:10,370
that we will need is this probability okay and so it is all of the day time

957
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:12,590
okay and so it is all of the day time the train from actual text copy text

958
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:15,860
the train from actual text copy text with subscript capital T so this is the

959
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,870
with subscript capital T so this is the smoothing distribution that gives me the

960
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,930
smoothing distribution that gives me the trait if they given all my exist with a

961
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,630
trait if they given all my exist with a parameter space alright and I remind

962
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:26,180
parameter space alright and I remind field of symbol we use for ballistic

963
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,280
field of symbol we use for ballistic this is the block was running on a suit

964
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,770
this is the block was running on a suit not the beta masters right this is this

965
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:32,780
not the beta masters right this is this moving distribution of ZT given all the

966
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,840
moving distribution of ZT given all the data and the other sufficient statistics

967
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,360
data and the other sufficient statistics we will need is the joint probably

968
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,470
we will need is the joint probably distribution of of ZT minus prong n CP

969
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:45,350
distribution of of ZT minus prong n CP given to the data so this is the joints

970
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:48,470
given to the data so this is the joints moving distribution that gives me Z at t

971
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:51,380
moving distribution that gives me Z at t minus 1 jointly with GP so if you

972
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:55,550
minus 1 jointly with GP so if you support that to compute this path and do

973
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:58,220
support that to compute this path and do this ex-professional calculation you

974
00:58:58,220 --> 00:58:59,420
this ex-professional calculation you will need to compute these two

975
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,480
will need to compute these two probabilities and that requires a

976
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,510
probabilities and that requires a calculation of messages and this

977
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:07,640
calculation of messages and this basically requires

978
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,520
basically requires with message calculation okay so

979
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:14,090
with message calculation okay so remember so yes with one of his messages

980
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:16,010
remember so yes with one of his messages are coming if you want to find the

981
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,140
are coming if you want to find the parameters in your model you have not

982
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:19,820
parameters in your model you have not choice in the yellow algorithm but the

983
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,350
choice in the yellow algorithm but the calculator is forward and backward

984
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,300
calculator is forward and backward passing messages and when a certain

985
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,830
passing messages and when a certain point of these things are coming but

986
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:25,660
point of these things are coming but rightousness

987
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:30,080
rightousness this is the big picture so let me just

988
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:36,290
this is the big picture so let me just put a plot here the Subic make visible

989
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,450
put a plot here the Subic make visible basically you start with some values of

990
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,960
basically you start with some values of the parameters you know there's lots of

991
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,300
the parameters you know there's lots of guidance we want to use to start with if

992
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:48,130
guidance we want to use to start with if you compute this posterior ok of

993
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:52,040
you compute this posterior ok of overstates given all the data in the

994
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,460
overstates given all the data in the previous parameters you calculate this

995
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:59,090
previous parameters you calculate this quantity Q which is the sexpectations

996
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:01,190
quantity Q which is the sexpectations force here of the joint log likelihood

997
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:03,410
force here of the joint log likelihood but you notice here in the log

998
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:06,020
but you notice here in the log likelihood you have no power

999
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,300
likelihood you have no power all right so whatever he did when I get

1000
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,430
all right so whatever he did when I get is going to be a function of theta then

1001
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:12,560
is going to be a function of theta then on the m-step you maximize with respect

1002
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,580
on the m-step you maximize with respect to theta

1003
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,620
to theta if you convert if you are done if not

1004
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,710
if you convert if you are done if not you come back you update the parameters

1005
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:20,480
you come back you update the parameters you compute a new posterior and you eat

1006
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,480
you compute a new posterior and you eat a new expectation of the joint of

1007
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:42,680
a new expectation of the joint of likelihood you maximize that you can do

1008
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:50,030
likelihood you maximize that you can do anything you want okay I want you to

1009
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:56,840
anything you want okay I want you to look at this expression and so you guys

1010
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:03,770
look at this expression and so you guys can see it again alright so this is the

1011
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:05,600
can see it again alright so this is the backward message is this moving

1012
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,800
backward message is this moving posterior of c30

1013
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:13,589
posterior of c30 all right and you remember city

1014
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:13,599


1015
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:26,259
so for example if the kids are equal to 1 you know what this is equal to is the

1016
01:01:26,259 --> 01:01:28,870
1 you know what this is equal to is the probability those little TJ would make

1017
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:31,749
probability those little TJ would make onto our but is also the expectation of

1018
01:01:31,749 --> 01:01:35,620
onto our but is also the expectation of the Zeta TJ why because if a TJ can only

1019
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:41,489
the Zeta TJ why because if a TJ can only take one is zero or one

1020
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:41,499


1021
01:01:41,499 --> 01:01:47,559
let me explain this again right so this is a vector Z T right but this can take

1022
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:52,150
is a vector Z T right but this can take values the CP you know why do whatever

1023
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:54,849
values the CP you know why do whatever states I have I have at this time I have

1024
01:01:54,849 --> 01:01:57,370
states I have I have at this time I have K different states right so I can write

1025
01:01:57,370 --> 01:02:01,499
K different states right so I can write this in a more easier part and a steak

1026
01:02:01,499 --> 01:02:04,989
this in a more easier part and a steak well now obviously PJ which is the

1027
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:07,450
well now obviously PJ which is the probability basically of ztj being equal

1028
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:10,870
probability basically of ztj being equal to one in a claim that that is actually

1029
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:14,589
to one in a claim that that is actually the expectation of z TJ because he

1030
01:02:14,589 --> 01:02:17,440
the expectation of z TJ because he visited J can take varnish only one and

1031
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,690
visited J can take varnish only one and zero the profession is the same as the

1032
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:26,650
zero the profession is the same as the probability West so effectively what I

1033
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:33,999
probability West so effectively what I claim is that the expectation of this

1034
01:02:33,999 --> 01:02:38,049
claim is that the expectation of this alright is the same community simply

1035
01:02:38,049 --> 01:02:39,970
alright is the same community simply because he fatigues English that the

1036
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:43,749
because he fatigues English that the clay has the varnish one of zero okay so

1037
01:02:43,749 --> 01:02:48,279
clay has the varnish one of zero okay so just and the tree which is the joints

1038
01:02:48,279 --> 01:02:50,920
just and the tree which is the joints moving distribution of ZT minus 1 and GT

1039
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,259
moving distribution of ZT minus 1 and GT they are really nothing else the

1040
01:02:53,259 --> 01:02:56,470
they are really nothing else the posterior expectations of the z TJ

1041
01:02:56,470 --> 01:03:01,450
posterior expectations of the z TJ variable remember that my definition of

1042
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:05,200
variable remember that my definition of gamma J right what was it the first

1043
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,529
gamma J right what was it the first period distribution is the posterior of

1044
01:03:08,529 --> 01:03:14,770
period distribution is the posterior of Z that they given all my data

1045
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:14,780


1046
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:36,290
mr. mission social expectation of Mitchell Pacific a values because forget

1047
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:41,050
Mitchell Pacific a values because forget about it so this is also the expectation

1048
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,030
about it so this is also the expectation so can you look at this equation here

1049
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:48,829
so can you look at this equation here now and tell me how from this equation

1050
01:03:48,829 --> 01:03:52,010
now and tell me how from this equation when I take logs and then expectation I

1051
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:54,319
when I take logs and then expectation I get this equation from what did that

1052
01:03:54,319 --> 01:04:00,970
get this equation from what did that come from I think the assumption is and

1053
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:04,730
come from I think the assumption is and this nice equation with the transition

1054
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:06,980
this nice equation with the transition probabilities to a boundary right and

1055
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:09,260
probabilities to a boundary right and you know we can do this the same thing

1056
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:12,500
you know we can do this the same thing there but how how did I get a grammar

1057
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,630
there but how how did I get a grammar there let's go to think of this now they

1058
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:43,720
there let's go to think of this now they are giving Rama what is 0k

1059
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:43,730


1060
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:52,400
this is also that is the posterior expectation of the z1k so how did they

1061
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:58,810
expectation of the z1k so how did they welcome this time to a gamma x level PK

1062
01:04:58,810 --> 01:04:58,820


1063
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:05,690
remember this terminal used to be the drama still anticipate that their

1064
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:08,540
the drama still anticipate that their indicator function that 0 and K is equal

1065
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:12,980
indicator function that 0 and K is equal to L can give you expectation and what

1066
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:15,800
to L can give you expectation and what is that the expectation is gamma Z 1 K

1067
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:25,730
is that the expectation is gamma Z 1 K so similarly this in the transition from

1068
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:28,900
so similarly this in the transition from t minus 1 to 3 you will get basically

1069
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,660
t minus 1 to 3 you will get basically this quantity K which is this motoring

1070
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,760
this quantity K which is this motoring joining posterior of z t minus 1 and t

1071
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,250
joining posterior of z t minus 1 and t so what is this actually

1072
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:42,170
so what is this actually this is expectation of what distribution

1073
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:46,860
this is expectation of what distribution and in the Hollywood

1074
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:46,870


1075
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:52,590
this is the joint distribution of city - rondell states a and city being a speck

1076
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:55,290
rondell states a and city being a speck a the proceeded expectation of that is

1077
01:05:55,290 --> 01:06:03,300
a the proceeded expectation of that is Vista the quantity T okay so the pension

1078
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,000
Vista the quantity T okay so the pension is right but this van that we completed

1079
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,530
is right but this van that we completed an exchange that we defined them as

1080
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:11,580
an exchange that we defined them as posterior distributions all right this

1081
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:14,400
posterior distributions all right this is how we define them okay this vectors

1082
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,490
is how we define them okay this vectors because if he can take value 1

1083
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:19,860
because if he can take value 1 you know I have different K State okay

1084
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:23,190
you know I have different K State okay so when I simplify this and I'm asking

1085
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:26,160
so when I simplify this and I'm asking what is grandma's GP k yes that is the

1086
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,010
what is grandma's GP k yes that is the posterior of ZT k being equal to on but

1087
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:31,580
posterior of ZT k being equal to on but is also the personal expectation of z TK

1088
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:35,160
is also the personal expectation of z TK similarly when I put this Z to minus 1 3

1089
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,450
similarly when I put this Z to minus 1 3 and c TK yes that is the probability for

1090
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:42,510
and c TK yes that is the probability for stated probability of city - Ron being

1091
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:44,910
stated probability of city - Ron being of say J and this being of state K but

1092
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:47,460
of say J and this being of state K but is also the personal expectation of was

1093
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:53,250
is also the personal expectation of was devoured and so when you take this joint

1094
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:56,940
devoured and so when you take this joint of livelihood right you take the joint

1095
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:58,860
of livelihood right you take the joint of likelihood you will get this

1096
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:01,050
of likelihood you will get this indicator functions from the front when

1097
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:05,640
indicator functions from the front when you write this any JK and on the top

1098
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,500
you write this any JK and on the top level get the indicator function that

1099
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,470
level get the indicator function that city - Sean J equal to 1 and Z 2 k equal

1100
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:13,260
city - Sean J equal to 1 and Z 2 k equal to 1 then when you take this will come

1101
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:21,870
to 1 then when you take this will come in you know expectation of that wine

1102
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:25,830
in you know expectation of that wine expectations because we say that we do

1103
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:28,380
expectations because we say that we do not operate with the joint of likelihood

1104
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:33,410
not operate with the joint of likelihood we have to take expectations

1105
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:33,420


1106
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:39,000
okay we have to take expectation with respect to the posterior of Z and those

1107
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,130
respect to the posterior of Z and those expectations give you basically the

1108
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:44,070
expectations give you basically the sufficient statistics and the sufficient

1109
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:46,820
sufficient statistics and the sufficient statistics come to be nothing else but

1110
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:50,460
statistics come to be nothing else but this before message this gamma and this

1111
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:53,190
this before message this gamma and this so this is moving distribution basically

1112
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:57,630
so this is moving distribution basically and the joint posterior of ZT minus 1

1113
01:07:57,630 --> 01:08:01,470
and the joint posterior of ZT minus 1 and ZT and I have female think here for

1114
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:03,630
and ZT and I have female think here for the observation mobile so there's

1115
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:05,880
the observation mobile so there's missing energy on the first time I'm

1116
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,230
missing energy on the first time I'm going to have k-state

1117
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:10,650
going to have k-state so I'm get the summation here I'm gonna

1118
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:14,670
so I'm get the summation here I'm gonna have this properly

1119
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:17,039
have this properly alright this is this product and I have

1120
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:19,079
alright this is this product and I have transitioned from gay personal space to

1121
01:08:19,079 --> 01:08:20,070
transitioned from gay personal space to carry possible states

1122
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:22,920
carry possible states so here the double summation and this is

1123
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,570
so here the double summation and this is the sufficient statistics do you get

1124
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:27,180
the sufficient statistics do you get longer days okay and here if you get

1125
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:30,960
longer days okay and here if you get again the scan local Christians and this

1126
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,289
again the scan local Christians and this is the log of the observation model

1127
01:08:33,289 --> 01:08:35,430
is the log of the observation model considering the Vermont state flag

1128
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:37,079
considering the Vermont state flag so the parameters corresponding to

1129
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,270
so the parameters corresponding to observation model would be clear big

1130
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:43,620
observation model would be clear big subscript K so I don't know if anybody

1131
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,349
subscript K so I don't know if anybody remembers but what is the meaning we

1132
01:08:46,349 --> 01:08:48,720
remembers but what is the meaning we have given what is given in the

1133
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,289
have given what is given in the literature to this posterior

1134
01:08:51,289 --> 01:09:05,039
literature to this posterior probabilities of z chain and we do not

1135
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:11,670
probabilities of z chain and we do not write the expectation of the there was

1136
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:15,990
write the expectation of the there was no z change instead of having kilogram

1137
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:19,260
no z change instead of having kilogram of z1 k what did we have on the Markov

1138
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:22,969
of z1 k what did we have on the Markov chain remember

1139
01:09:22,969 --> 01:09:22,979


1140
01:09:22,979 --> 01:09:31,529
remember sufficient statistics on a Markov chain just which is the time the

1141
01:09:31,529 --> 01:09:34,519
Markov chain just which is the time the number of times that the first let's say

1142
01:09:34,519 --> 01:09:44,569
number of times that the first let's say of the you know final on home state K so

1143
01:09:44,569 --> 01:09:56,779
of the you know final on home state K so again that was telling me how many times

1144
01:09:56,779 --> 01:09:56,789


1145
01:09:56,789 --> 01:10:04,069
here because this is a procedure quantity so this is observes the data

1146
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:08,580
quantity so this is observes the data right is what is the expectation of the

1147
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:13,169
right is what is the expectation of the times that I will be on on my time step

1148
01:10:13,169 --> 01:10:17,359
times that I will be on on my time step one on state K this is what we call the

1149
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:20,279
one on state K this is what we call the what's the matter that we used what is

1150
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:25,379
what's the matter that we used what is used in the literature that we use

1151
01:10:25,379 --> 01:10:28,109
used in the literature that we use especially for a you remember on how you

1152
01:10:28,109 --> 01:10:35,870
especially for a you remember on how you do the am aware if conversion mixtures

1153
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:35,880


1154
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:48,420
I'm looking you know whip type of things you get frequency okay I know it's a

1155
01:10:48,420 --> 01:11:06,900
you get frequency okay I know it's a little hard responsibility right and I'm

1156
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:11,340
little hard responsibility right and I'm looking at state one in a procedure

1157
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:15,180
looking at state one in a procedure setting how many times my state one is I

1158
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:38,880
setting how many times my state one is I mean you know the parameter and then I'm

1159
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,310
mean you know the parameter and then I'm gonna destroy implying the spy this

1160
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:43,800
gonna destroy implying the spy this payee and this coefficients be in the

1161
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,020
payee and this coefficients be in the observation model we wanted to work with

1162
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:49,710
observation model we wanted to work with a joint likelihood because computation

1163
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:51,720
a joint likelihood because computation is very easy to write this a discrete

1164
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,360
is very easy to write this a discrete model this would say suggestions very

1165
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:58,920
model this would say suggestions very nice okay what years so how can we

1166
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,960
nice okay what years so how can we compute by what we don't know so there

1167
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:06,690
compute by what we don't know so there this yes the expectation with respect to

1168
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:09,330
this yes the expectation with respect to the posterior of Z right and then they

1169
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:12,450
the posterior of Z right and then they stiffen the complexity but how can I do

1170
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:14,160
stiffen the complexity but how can I do this well that posterior depends on the

1171
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,160
this well that posterior depends on the parameters PI an a and C so the second

1172
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,900
parameters PI an a and C so the second step is well start iterating on

1173
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:22,680
step is well start iterating on disparities so something didn't compute

1174
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:25,200
disparities so something didn't compute the expectation of this with respect to

1175
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,300
the expectation of this with respect to the posterior given the parameters all

1176
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:29,630
the posterior given the parameters all right this is what you see here then

1177
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:32,540
right this is what you see here then when we have this quantity

1178
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:34,819
when we have this quantity into this quantity now we didn't take

1179
01:12:34,819 --> 01:12:36,950
into this quantity now we didn't take derivatives with respect to Phi K alpha

1180
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:40,910
derivatives with respect to Phi K alpha JK and with respect to pre-k right and

1181
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:45,169
JK and with respect to pre-k right and we keep doing iteration this is actually

1182
01:12:45,169 --> 01:12:47,359
we keep doing iteration this is actually a first step it looks identical to what

1183
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,069
a first step it looks identical to what we had for Markov chains there is really

1184
01:12:49,069 --> 01:12:51,830
we had for Markov chains there is really nothing that is different okay

1185
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:53,629
nothing that is different okay so you can go in to use Lagrange

1186
01:12:53,629 --> 01:12:55,970
so you can go in to use Lagrange multipliers to infer that the sum of

1187
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:58,520
multipliers to infer that the sum of five K's is equal to one and then take

1188
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,500
five K's is equal to one and then take derivatives with this and I can tell you

1189
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,919
derivatives with this and I can tell you this research on these maximization step

1190
01:13:03,919 --> 01:13:06,049
this research on these maximization step the suit is identical to what we did for

1191
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:08,780
the suit is identical to what we did for a Markov chain but the the medium of the

1192
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:41,890
a Markov chain but the the medium of the singles is very different coming to be

1193
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:41,900


1194
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:56,620
okay

1195
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:56,630


1196
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:02,390
/ this pristine responsibilities of the time Varnum in any state vary from one

1197
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:05,479
time Varnum in any state vary from one to K and similarly energy H is defined

1198
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:10,520
to K and similarly energy H is defined by the posterior transition

1199
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:15,140
by the posterior transition probabilities that so this patient a JK

1200
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:17,660
probabilities that so this patient a JK so but at time t minus one among set

1201
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:20,420
so but at time t minus one among set among state J and then I transitional

1202
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:22,790
among state J and then I transitional time T to state k so this is exactly

1203
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:25,280
time T to state k so this is exactly what we had before the only difference

1204
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,459
what we had before the only difference is that this gene gamma our posterior

1205
01:14:28,459 --> 01:14:31,670
is that this gene gamma our posterior probabilities and there's nothing

1206
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:34,490
probabilities and there's nothing probabilities because here to calculate

1207
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:37,940
probabilities because here to calculate gamma and your current flow the data

1208
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,910
gamma and your current flow the data from time let's say 1 or 0 all the way

1209
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,620
from time let's say 1 or 0 all the way to capital T okay

1210
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:44,950
to capital T okay so this one's smoking probabilities not

1211
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:47,300
so this one's smoking probabilities not predictive probability stress not

1212
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,700
predictive probability stress not something you know you can stay up here

1213
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:54,910
something you know you can stay up here and estimate what this is okay series

1214
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:57,830
and estimate what this is okay series alright and then you say now can you

1215
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:01,700
alright and then you say now can you tell me what the expectation when the

1216
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:03,979
tell me what the expectation when the probability of z1 K being equal to 1 and

1217
01:15:03,979 --> 01:15:06,380
probability of z1 K being equal to 1 and is given by this entity so that will

1218
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:08,630
is given by this entity so that will give you PI K etcetera etcetera

1219
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:12,050
give you PI K etcetera etcetera and insanity enclosures because he's run

1220
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:14,090
and insanity enclosures because he's run for the calendars and how do you

1221
01:15:14,090 --> 01:16:12,409
for the calendars and how do you calculate

1222
01:16:12,409 --> 01:16:12,419


1223
01:16:12,419 --> 01:16:19,349
so this is a possibility because I am counting all of the data right in my

1224
01:16:19,349 --> 01:16:21,779
counting all of the data right in my stickers and I'm waiting them with these

1225
01:16:21,779 --> 01:16:23,129
stickers and I'm waiting them with these probabilities which are the posterior

1226
01:16:23,129 --> 01:16:25,229
probabilities which are the posterior probabilities and similarly for the

1227
01:16:25,229 --> 01:16:28,709
probabilities and similarly for the variance basically it is like you know

1228
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:30,989
variance basically it is like you know you're estimating a Gaussian alright you

1229
01:16:30,989 --> 01:16:33,419
you're estimating a Gaussian alright you are using all the data okay

1230
01:16:33,419 --> 01:16:35,399
are using all the data okay this is with respect to this mean by the

1231
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:36,419
this is with respect to this mean by the way all right

1232
01:16:36,419 --> 01:16:39,329
way all right this is very important and again your

1233
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:41,189
this is very important and again your wafers with respect to the

1234
01:16:41,189 --> 01:16:45,540
wafers with respect to the responsibilities that the data time T

1235
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:48,509
responsibilities that the data time T belongs to theta you can extend this to

1236
01:16:48,509 --> 01:16:52,079
belongs to theta you can extend this to actually to the distribution so if you

1237
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:54,209
actually to the distribution so if you have a multinomial or Bernoulli

1238
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,459
have a multinomial or Bernoulli distribution many other things work you

1239
01:16:56,459 --> 01:17:06,239
distribution many other things work you can work the algebra by the way is I'm

1240
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:10,619
can work the algebra by the way is I'm going to go back and bring it to the

1241
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:13,139
going to go back and bring it to the need basically so completing the smoking

1242
01:17:13,139 --> 01:17:15,270
need basically so completing the smoking distributions so you people think is

1243
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:16,469
distributions so you people think is working distributions

1244
01:17:16,469 --> 01:17:18,049
working distributions sort of

1245
01:17:18,049 --> 01:17:20,839
sort of then you know who wants to use all the

1246
01:17:20,839 --> 01:17:22,359
then you know who wants to use all the data we are interested in online

1247
01:17:22,359 --> 01:17:25,189
data we are interested in online estimation right but you can see when if

1248
01:17:25,189 --> 01:17:26,450
estimation right but you can see when if you do the expectation-maximization

1249
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:30,609
you do the expectation-maximization algorithm you really need to have this

1250
01:17:30,609 --> 01:17:33,490
algorithm you really need to have this posterior responsibilities and disjoint

1251
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:36,950
posterior responsibilities and disjoint expectations and those required that you

1252
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:39,609
expectations and those required that you use all the data so there's nothing

1253
01:17:39,609 --> 01:17:42,080
use all the data so there's nothing distributions so we'll discuss on how

1254
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,500
distributions so we'll discuss on how with message-passing we can compute them

1255
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,359
with message-passing we can compute them I'm going to practice like the best when

1256
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:50,959
I'm going to practice like the best when I look at them to acquire the things

1257
01:17:50,959 --> 01:17:52,700
I look at them to acquire the things looking they're very complicated but I

1258
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:55,520
looking they're very complicated but I think in many ways the hmm model is the

1259
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,000
think in many ways the hmm model is the simplest okay so you should invest some

1260
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,760
simplest okay so you should invest some time to understand
