1
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,900
in the introduction without the microphone so we're gonna start going

2
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,370
microphone so we're gonna start going back to the liquor obligation as an

3
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,080
back to the liquor obligation as an example basically to see how the

4
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,410
example basically to see how the equations look like for an undirected

5
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,330
equations look like for an undirected graph particularly for photography

6
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,990
graph particularly for photography okay so we're going to see how to delete

7
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,640
okay so we're going to see how to delete propagation algorithm loops for animal F

8
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,160
propagation algorithm loops for animal F that has these cell potentials the way

9
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,230
that has these cell potentials the way you have seen in the past and then it

10
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,570
you have seen in the past and then it has this pair of potentials with receipt

11
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,120
has this pair of potentials with receipt here okay so we are the number of nodes

12
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,120
here okay so we are the number of nodes okay

13
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,910
okay SOT our edges in the graph so this term

14
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,180
SOT our edges in the graph so this term vs potential square potentials and Z is

15
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,480
vs potential square potentials and Z is the normalization factor all right so

16
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,710
the normalization factor all right so the the presentation it looks like a

17
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,150
the the presentation it looks like a slightly different but you know if you

18
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,670
slightly different but you know if you got the idea of message passing

19
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,810
got the idea of message passing effectively they are the same things

20
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,350
effectively they are the same things okay so what we're gonna do is we are

21
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,020
okay so what we're gonna do is we are going to assume a general basically

22
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,280
going to assume a general basically Markov random field so and we're gonna

23
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,650
Markov random field so and we're gonna use the same ideas we did for to it so

24
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,330
use the same ideas we did for to it so you know you can take the mountain from

25
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,670
you know you can take the mountain from the whole thing and say you know and

26
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,800
the whole thing and say you know and whatever is from the bottom which are

27
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,200
whatever is from the bottom which are the leaves and in some sense stop

28
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,820
the leaves and in some sense stop sending messages from the leaves to the

29
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,640
sending messages from the leaves to the root that's the collect evidence step

30
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,550
root that's the collect evidence step and then going from the roots all the

31
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,680
and then going from the roots all the way to the link before we are ready to

32
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,460
way to the link before we are ready to calculate marginal can do inference

33
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:18,470


34
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,430
so because I need to do this in the belief propagation sort of concept I'm

35
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,750
belief propagation sort of concept I'm going to define what belief propagation

36
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,670
going to define what belief propagation is so let's take a note - I mean a note

37
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,990
is so let's take a note - I mean a note P but just silver Nessun you even though

38
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,530
P but just silver Nessun you even though this to not you know a directed graph

39
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,960
this to not you know a directed graph but you can think of this if you found

40
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,420
but you can think of this if you found it again from T these are the neighbors

41
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,650
it again from T these are the neighbors directly connected with lists of the of

42
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,320
directly connected with lists of the of the children so we define that is called

43
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,050
the children so we define that is called the bottom half belief state of the node

44
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,460
the bottom half belief state of the node T to be the probability of XT given the

45
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,070
T to be the probability of XT given the evidence from below all right

46
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,820
evidence from below all right so the idea is that you notice the

47
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,830
so the idea is that you notice the phrase the grafton this is the evidence

48
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,430
phrase the grafton this is the evidence coming from below right this is very

49
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,700
coming from below right this is very important so this is what is called the

50
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,760
important so this is what is called the bottom-up belief state as you go from

51
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,160
bottom-up belief state as you go from the leaves to the rope to define the

52
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,780
the leaves to the rope to define the belief state of every node and it

53
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,150
belief state of every node and it represents the probability of XT given

54
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,840
represents the probability of XT given the evidence below alright now the idea

55
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,260
the evidence below alright now the idea is somehow the way we have done in the

56
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,330
is somehow the way we have done in the past we have learned how to propagate

57
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,890
past we have learned how to propagate vestiges from the tape from the timber

58
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:40,560
vestiges from the tape from the timber last few and especially as charged

59
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,460
last few and especially as charged right and so effectively this message

60
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,070
right and so effectively this message that you see here is the probability of

61
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:52,000
that you see here is the probability of XT given this evidence and from the

62
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,620
XT given this evidence and from the graph can you tell me what the words

63
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,070
graph can you tell me what the words what evidence did I mean we did this in

64
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,620
what evidence did I mean we did this in principle when we work with trees and

65
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,270
principle when we work with trees and poly trees so this message is from s to

66
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,420
poly trees so this message is from s to P is really the probability of P and it

67
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,630
P is really the probability of P and it is this you know the belief basically

68
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,800
is this you know the belief basically given what evidence

69
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,159
given what evidence what do you think this evidence is it

70
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:19,360
what do you think this evidence is it says V subscript s and T and then - so

71
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,590
says V subscript s and T and then - so what's the idea here

72
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,070
what's the idea here if I have an edge

73
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:28,380
if I have an edge let this be a speed - is the evidence

74
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,660
let this be a speed - is the evidence comment from what part of the graph from

75
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:40,500
comment from what part of the graph from Mouse thing or plot gives noticed the

76
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,140
Mouse thing or plot gives noticed the HST

77
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,570
HST you remember if you take espy right this

78
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,020
you remember if you take espy right this is subtree and the evidence of comes

79
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,150
is subtree and the evidence of comes from that it's really this message so

80
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,490
from that it's really this message so this master summarizes all the

81
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,580
this master summarizes all the information the evidence that you see

82
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,150
information the evidence that you see here below this blue coastline provides

83
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:04,410
here below this blue coastline provides you know T okay and so similarly to this

84
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,150
you know T okay and so similarly to this message we also have the message to the

85
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,490
message we also have the message to the beauty etc so the bottom-up belief state

86
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:17,420
beauty etc so the bottom-up belief state of the know T it is nothing else but the

87
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,300
of the know T it is nothing else but the potential of the node X P times all the

88
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,250
potential of the node X P times all the messages that are coming from below

89
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,370
messages that are coming from below alright so in this case two example this

90
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,850
alright so in this case two example this graph from s and Q because this vest is

91
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,760
graph from s and Q because this vest is progressing you summarized all the

92
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,060
progressing you summarized all the belief that we get from the bottom down

93
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,630
belief that we get from the bottom down okay so these are the children of T and

94
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,820
okay so these are the children of T and again I'm using this in a liberal sense

95
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,520
again I'm using this in a liberal sense because this is not a directed graph

96
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,860
because this is not a directed graph where I have a definition of children

97
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,720
where I have a definition of children but you can see what this implies from

98
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,430
but you can see what this implies from this graph so we propagate messages and

99
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,620
this graph so we propagate messages and the question is how do we compute this

100
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,020
the question is how do we compute this messages and we compute this messages

101
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,150
messages and we compute this messages recursively the way we have done before

102
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,370
recursively the way we have done before but now this is written slightly

103
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,500
but now this is written slightly different so the message from below from

104
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,350
different so the message from below from s to T it is a maximization s of the

105
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,210
s to T it is a maximization s of the joint potential of the non certainty

106
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,310
joint potential of the non certainty exactly as we have done before

107
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,980
exactly as we have done before times the belief of first - the belief

108
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,170
times the belief of first - the belief of no - coming communal so what is

109
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:27,290
of no - coming communal so what is really the belief subscript s -

110
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:33,320
really the belief subscript s - is evidence of comes from the no

111
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,550
is evidence of comes from the no s-tronic service you can think of this

112
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,769
s-tronic service you can think of this for example the all the message is

113
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,800
for example the all the message is coming to us from its children but now

114
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,690
coming to us from its children but now what I have done is I've written because

115
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,840
what I have done is I've written because I define explicitly what this is for any

116
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,550
I define explicitly what this is for any now I am using the belief from below for

117
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,769
now I am using the belief from below for now to write this equation in a slightly

118
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:53,840
now to write this equation in a slightly different manner

119
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,940
different manner so actually spelling cannabis lists how

120
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,160
so actually spelling cannabis lists how things were written right but if you

121
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,440
things were written right but if you don't like this definition you can go

122
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,810
don't like this definition you can go back to the old way I mean the way with

123
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,750
back to the old way I mean the way with discussions with messages but in the

124
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,670
discussions with messages but in the context of belief propagation this

125
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:13,380
context of belief propagation this equation is written like a so if you

126
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,260
equation is written like a so if you propagate beliefs basically from

127
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,720
propagate beliefs basically from evidence from below all the way to the

128
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,240
evidence from below all the way to the written once you reach the route

129
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,740
written once you reach the route effectively you have the probability of

130
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,210
effectively you have the probability of the route given all the evidence below

131
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,060
the route given all the evidence below and effectively that according to our

132
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,250
and effectively that according to our skin is the marginal of Nordics our

133
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,940
skin is the marginal of Nordics our times the product of all the messages

134
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,150
times the product of all the messages coming from the children of the root to

135
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,430
coming from the children of the root to the okay but the messages are coming

136
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:56,250
the okay but the messages are coming from below or population basically is

137
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,960
from below or population basically is the products of this normalization

138
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,449
the products of this normalization factor CP and the mystical Z becomes Z T

139
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:06,090
factor CP and the mystical Z becomes Z T basically is the normalization factor

140
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,170
basically is the normalization factor for each of this belief phase from below

141
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,850
for each of this belief phase from below you know what actually just produced

142
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,780
you know what actually just produced upon one line compilation to convince

143
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,990
upon one line compilation to convince yourselves that it could take all of

144
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,790
yourselves that it could take all of this is a taste and you multiply them

145
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,790
this is a taste and you multiply them together from the leaves to the road you

146
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,460
together from the leaves to the road you basically get the evidence

147
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,410
basically get the evidence the Maserati could make a pelvic

148
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,690
the Maserati could make a pelvic there's an extra sort of car bombs from

149
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,940
there's an extra sort of car bombs from this hopeless okay so here is and now

150
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,380
this hopeless okay so here is and now you're ready to start distributing

151
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,020
you're ready to start distributing informational downwards to the same way

152
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,370
informational downwards to the same way we have done with message passing so now

153
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,890
we have done with message passing so now as we start sending messages that say

154
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,240
as we start sending messages that say from T to s we are going to update us

155
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,430
from T to s we are going to update us then you notice now because when you

156
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,570
then you notice now because when you stop message sending message from T to s

157
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,630
stop message sending message from T to s actually with no accessories which is

158
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,820
actually with no accessories which is the probability of access given all the

159
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,220
the probability of access given all the evidence because we accounted evidence

160
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,710
evidence because we accounted evidence from banila and some accounting evidence

161
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,650
from banila and some accounting evidence from Abed all right so we the the belief

162
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,550
from Abed all right so we the the belief of X s is T of X s given V and it is

163
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:20,230
of X s is T of X s given V and it is very simple is the belief you know it's

164
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,120
very simple is the belief you know it's from the bottom up this is from the

165
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,700
from the bottom up this is from the first page of the algorithm finds all

166
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,470
first page of the algorithm finds all the messages that are coming from the

167
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,550
the messages that are coming from the parents but know this you agree in this

168
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,890
parents but know this you agree in this case the Jaypee and something else there

169
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:37,450
case the Jaypee and something else there okay so you know what we're doing

170
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,170
okay so you know what we're doing masters passing we have some scallion

171
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,730
masters passing we have some scallion like they actually we're exactly how

172
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,620
like they actually we're exactly how this equation on looking like before the

173
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,810
this equation on looking like before the messages when we didn't have this

174
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,840
messages when we didn't have this concept of belief so obviously we have

175
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,410
concept of belief so obviously we have the messages coming from above from the

176
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,390
the messages coming from above from the parents and here we did we have so if

177
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,990
parents and here we did we have so if you look at any node all right there's

178
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,390
you look at any node all right there's no not only receives messages from team

179
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,480
no not only receives messages from team but also receives message from what

180
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,490


181
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,850
you have to include the messages from the whole then of those messages now

182
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,910
the whole then of those messages now they're inside the belief - of now

183
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,750
they're inside the belief - of now effector some toothpaste the

184
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,460
effector some toothpaste the parameterization of the same Estes

185
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,720
parameterization of the same Estes fasting a questions would have doubt

186
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:39,270
fasting a questions would have doubt there's really nothing you yep

187
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:39,280


188
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:45,420
you know social location we win over the our price we passed the retailers and

189
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,360
our price we passed the retailers and now we need to start replicating belief

190
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,330
now we need to start replicating belief from there it all the way down because a

191
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,940
from there it all the way down because a lot of these notes have not yet received

192
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:23,670
lot of these notes have not yet received information from without going up and

193
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,610
information from without going up and down and actually you can do that the

194
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,990
down and actually you can do that the only thing you have to do is you have to

195
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,690
only thing you have to do is you have to initialize the message to be one so

196
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,550
initialize the message to be one so there is something to send right and

197
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,440
there is something to send right and after that you don't really have to go

198
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,360
after that you don't really have to go up you don't have to go down strong this

199
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,130
up you don't have to go down strong this came out good

200
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,600
came out good and this is sort of what you know using

201
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,250
and this is sort of what you know using sort of an idea of listening

202
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,000
sort of an idea of listening you can't respond same with messages

203
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,320
you can't respond same with messages anymore we can send messages send

204
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,160
anymore we can send messages send messages all right but right now we are

205
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,130
messages all right but right now we are looking for forward and backward

206
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,920
looking for forward and backward propagation and we writing this in terms

207
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,490
propagation and we writing this in terms of the list so the final belief of not

208
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,220
of the list so the final belief of not exist having received information from

209
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,250
exist having received information from above and below is to believe that we

210
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,740
above and below is to believe that we calculate this in as we went from the

211
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,440
calculate this in as we went from the links to the route and all the times all

212
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,880
links to the route and all the times all the products of the messages that

213
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,100
the products of the messages that basically comes from the parlance of no

214
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,190
basically comes from the parlance of no they're all right

215
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,120
they're all right and here's another equation now that the

216
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,840
and here's another equation now that the waves from the

217
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:31,850


218
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,699
from the message passing algorithm you have seen so you may say and what's the

219
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:39,009
have seen so you may say and what's the message that this sends to us now right

220
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:40,629
message that this sends to us now right as we go down goes from the root to the

221
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:44,829
as we go down goes from the root to the lives so that message is basically this

222
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:47,499
lives so that message is basically this is the definition right is the

223
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:50,430
is the definition right is the probability of XT given the upstream

224
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,800
probability of XT given the upstream evidence on the edge of T and it's given

225
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,889
evidence on the edge of T and it's given by marginalizing so this is the

226
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:59,970
by marginalizing so this is the information distance to ask right

227
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,740
information distance to ask right distance press does this look elect to

228
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:10,179
distance press does this look elect to you these term stress so it seems I am

229
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:13,840
you these term stress so it seems I am messed up the summation here okay so the

230
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,539
messed up the summation here okay so the information Teamsters crest will be the

231
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:21,189
information Teamsters crest will be the potential of the sphere and look at this

232
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:24,429
potential of the sphere and look at this now in many circumstances you know

233
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:26,470
now in many circumstances you know whether we have so if you look at the

234
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,230
whether we have so if you look at the message from T to s right so you have to

235
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,180
message from T to s right so you have to include the messages that arrived from

236
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,810
include the messages that arrived from above to ask all right my function you

237
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,159
above to ask all right my function you have to include all the messages are

238
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,560
have to include all the messages are coming from below so look at this

239
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,330
coming from below so look at this equation and tell me what exact is this

240
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,260
equation and tell me what exact is this  there's no - on this belief so what

241
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,060
there's no - on this belief so what exactly is this thing that we see this

242
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,500
exactly is this thing that we see this fraction

243
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:52,510


244
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:57,390
I mean stupid water when looking the messes from repeat to ask okay going

245
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,710
messes from repeat to ask okay going downwards so what is this distance

246
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:08,100
downwards so what is this distance dressed this misbelief state mr. Zhu -

247
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,640
dressed this misbelief state mr. Zhu - search maybe if you want addresses from

248
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,630
search maybe if you want addresses from above and below

249
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,240
above and below but here I'm dividing it by the message

250
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,980
but here I'm dividing it by the message that that sends the tip from below

251
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:24,090
that that sends the tip from below shall I stop you remember when you

252
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,970
shall I stop you remember when you update right I know there's the message

253
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,799
update right I know there's the message coming from below and the message coming

254
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,440
coming from below and the message coming from above all of this really this

255
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,210
from above all of this really this message will give you the belief of

256
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,750
message will give you the belief of Nordics fee but I'm dividing it by the

257
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,030
Nordics fee but I'm dividing it by the message that essence today from below so

258
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:44,190
message that essence today from below so what is that because they are not gonna

259
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,140
what is that because they are not gonna circular knowledge a mess is not an

260
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,180
circular knowledge a mess is not an alternative

261
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,190


262
00:18:51,190 --> 00:19:13,290
life is the same way remember when we don't so that's an early privatization

263
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,990
don't so that's an early privatization of the equations the way originally

264
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,500
of the equations the way originally belief propagation was introduced in

265
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,090
belief propagation was introduced in principle really I mean if you correctly

266
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,220
principle really I mean if you correctly both ways you will get the same answer

267
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,860
both ways you will get the same answer so one way to look is this way another

268
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,980
so one way to look is this way another way is with a message passing passing as

269
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,750
way is with a message passing passing as we did before so it's the same story all

270
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:41,730
we did before so it's the same story all right now the migration and well you do

271
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,190
right now the migration and well you do this division as a song here is called

272
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,130
this division as a song here is called belief updating the Russian will be

273
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,650
belief updating the Russian will be multiplied messages the way we have done

274
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,500
multiplied messages the way we have done in the earlier lectures is really the

275
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,270
in the earlier lectures is really the sum-product algorithm so that's what we

276
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,870
sum-product algorithm so that's what we already have stained and with this new

277
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,460
already have stained and with this new parameterization you get this concept of

278
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:05,750
parameterization you get this concept of belief updating no messages update okay

279
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,260
belief updating no messages update okay all right so this is it can happen that

280
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,250
all right so this is it can happen that the Southwick

281
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,950
the Southwick you know you are operate on a tree the

282
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,740
you know you are operate on a tree the situation is very simple you know if

283
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:23,700
situation is very simple you know if you're going to camp you know so let me

284
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,600
you're going to camp you know so let me look here it says

285
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:26,610


286
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:32,660
actually let me let me because this was in earlier slides okay so we are looking

287
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,240
in earlier slides okay so we are looking now from the messages from top down all

288
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,140
now from the messages from top down all right from feet west okay so we just

289
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,810
right from feet west okay so we just noticed equation okay and we sent the

290
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:45,920
noticed equation okay and we sent the message from feet west is given with

291
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,080
message from feet west is given with these potential times the belief of node

292
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,600
these potential times the belief of node X T divided by the message that comes

293
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,900
X T divided by the message that comes from below from load test so to update

294
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,630
from below from load test so to update this message this from above you need to

295
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,000
this message this from above you need to know investors coming from below so you

296
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,580
know investors coming from below so you need is not the sufficient to only keep

297
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,280
need is not the sufficient to only keep top of the beliefs of the nodes you need

298
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,200
top of the beliefs of the nodes you need to keep track of the messages coming

299
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,990
to keep track of the messages coming from below and that's why this message

300
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,120
from below and that's why this message is from above if you would see lots of

301
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,180
is from above if you would see lots of books interpret the test conditional

302
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,810
books interpret the test conditional posterior probability and actually in

303
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,790
posterior probability and actually in the slides that I gave you for directed

304
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,880
the slides that I gave you for directed graphs and written this is like a cell

305
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,280
graphs and written this is like a cell sample a posterior probability here is

306
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,000
sample a posterior probability here is you are ready considering evidence from

307
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,580
you are ready considering evidence from below in computing these messages with

308
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,070
below in computing these messages with this parametrization so you can put sort

309
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,330
this parametrization so you can put sort of the meaning of this being a

310
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,190
of the meaning of this being a conditional posterior probability but

311
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,550
conditional posterior probability but the old way that we did right if you

312
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,770
the old way that we did right if you cannot do that right so the

313
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,360
cannot do that right so the interpretation is basically these

314
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,210
interpretation is basically these messages are like likelihoods vesicle

315
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,620
messages are like likelihoods vesicle conditional likelihood

316
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:54,630


317
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,539
I mean you can see in for example this is written for a piece here there's no

318
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:01,640
is written for a piece here there's no message from below alright so you cannot

319
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,500
message from below alright so you cannot call it the conditional probability so

320
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,029
call it the conditional probability so the protocol basically in simple terms

321
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:18,049
the protocol basically in simple terms right so we'll explain if you go from to

322
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:20,630
right so we'll explain if you go from to the list and then you can calculate any

323
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,390
the list and then you can calculate any sort of marginal stuff of interest and

324
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,390
sort of marginal stuff of interest and you can calculate the dictates but

325
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,080
you can calculate the dictates but actually what you can do is you can

326
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,000
actually what you can do is you can initialize all the messages to something

327
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,830
initialize all the messages to something and that can be arbitrary let's say

328
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:39,169
and that can be arbitrary let's say equal to 1 and it's really basically to

329
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:40,990
equal to 1 and it's really basically to take messages from all of its neighbors

330
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,640
take messages from all of its neighbors so you have they directly the belief of

331
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,080
so you have they directly the belief of every node as the cell potential times

332
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,789
every node as the cell potential times the product of all the messages coming

333
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:51,200
the product of all the messages coming from all of its neighbors

334
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,899
from all of its neighbors there's no anymore above and below you

335
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:57,560
there's no anymore above and below you know downstream and upstream sort of

336
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,529
know downstream and upstream sort of belief you can actually start updating

337
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:03,490
belief you can actually start updating the belief of all the nodes this way and

338
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,260
the belief of all the nodes this way and when are you going to convert when

339
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,640
when are you going to convert when basically the message that you've

340
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,789
basically the message that you've converted and the message have converged

341
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,960
converted and the message have converged when effectively information from every

342
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,120
when effectively information from every other node so the number of steps

343
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,010
other node so the number of steps basically that you have to drag this

344
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,140
basically that you have to drag this would be as large as the size of your

345
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:32,860
would be as large as the size of your graph ok so so they basically converges

346
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,810
graph ok so so they basically converges linearly with the size of the graph

347
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,520
linearly with the size of the graph which is proportional to the number

348
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:45,110
which is proportional to the number in the gun right and if you check the

349
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,430
in the gun right and if you check the Nicollet sure that you will find too

350
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,260
Nicollet sure that you will find too much of different algorithms for doing

351
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,760
much of different algorithms for doing finalization of this okay and there are

352
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,720
finalization of this okay and there are extremely fast

353
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,090
extremely fast and keep in mind this all gonna start

354
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,220
and keep in mind this all gonna start exactly

355
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,080
exactly there's no approximation there example

356
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,140
there's no approximation there example okay so so they're very nice okay

357
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,740
okay so so they're very nice okay I think so they gave you homework you

358
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,560
I think so they gave you homework you know that if I remember if you're

359
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,160
know that if I remember if you're supposed to implement a marker a magic

360
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,160
supposed to implement a marker a magic marker marker on appeal okay something

361
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,710
marker marker on appeal okay something like that not exactly

362
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:23,720


363
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,070
it was undirected block

364
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,080


365
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:41,800
okay okay I haven't questioned was homework 3 if I

366
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,340
I haven't questioned was homework 3 if I remember so here is a Gaussian Markov

367
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,050
remember so here is a Gaussian Markov random field where the cell potential

368
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,800
random field where the cell potential basically a Gaussian this is sort of a

369
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,970
basically a Gaussian this is sort of a normalized Gaussian

370
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,620
normalized Gaussian all right you close the square you get

371
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,240
all right you close the square you get the Gaussian and then you have their

372
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,970
the Gaussian and then you have their potentials to define Phi of s and T so

373
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,940
potentials to define Phi of s and T so when you put all of this together the

374
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,470
when you put all of this together the joint probability of X is really

375
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,870
joint probability of X is really Gaussian and here I'm reading it I'm

376
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,550
Gaussian and here I'm reading it I'm writing it in sort of an immobilized

377
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:11,620
writing it in sort of an immobilized fall okay so the minima nausea if you

378
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,970
fall okay so the minima nausea if you close the square you're going to have to

379
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,440
close the square you're going to have to invert this matrix a minus 1 B and this

380
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,120
invert this matrix a minus 1 B and this is a very costly calculation right

381
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,630
is a very costly calculation right important metrics it goes to the cube of

382
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,270
important metrics it goes to the cube of the size of this matrix but if you do

383
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:29,050
the size of this matrix but if you do this calculation using this belief

384
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,640
this calculation using this belief propagation now what it means you can do

385
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,410
propagation now what it means you can do it you have you with the size of the

386
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,370
it you have you with the size of the graph so we need to see how we can do

387
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:40,420
graph so we need to see how we can do the propagation with Gaussian with

388
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,820
the propagation with Gaussian with Gaussian distribution so here is the

389
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,030
Gaussian distribution so here is the advance for the cell potential but I out

390
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,530
advance for the cell potential but I out here if you pull of the square

391
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:52,300
here if you pull of the square it is a Gaussian so the mean and the

392
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,820
it is a Gaussian so the mean and the precision are written here explicitly

393
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:01,540
precision are written here explicitly all right the the procedure the

394
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,810
all right the the procedure the marginals at every known country one

395
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,660
marginals at every known country one should be Gaussian right because you can

396
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,190
should be Gaussian right because you can sleep on clearly if the joint is a

397
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,350
sleep on clearly if the joint is a Gaussian obviously all the margins will

398
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,270
Gaussian obviously all the margins will be Gaussian strong of interest will be

399
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,120
be Gaussian strong of interest will be to calculate near T and lambda T okay

400
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,250
to calculate near T and lambda T okay and you need to do this at the cost that

401
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,340
and you need to do this at the cost that is not the same as inverting that matrix

402
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,550
is not the same as inverting that matrix a but something way more efficient to be

403
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,230
a but something way more efficient to be able to do that we need to manipulate

404
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,570
able to do that we need to manipulate the audience and it sounds like a

405
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,840
the audience and it sounds like a right when especially in one dimension

406
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,330
right when especially in one dimension but this can be very complicated if you

407
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:39,220
but this can be very complicated if you can have an explosion of calculation

408
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,590
can have an explosion of calculation says especially if you try to explain

409
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,740
says especially if you try to explain this to you know just gaussians but

410
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,100
this to you know just gaussians but mixture of gaussians so what you need to

411
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,519
mixture of gaussians so what you need to know sir one simple formula or pill one

412
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:54,940
know sir one simple formula or pill one is the format of gaussians and you have

413
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,139
is the format of gaussians and you have to write on what is called an

414
00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:57,789
to write on what is called an information form share to use

415
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:00,159
information form share to use Precision's rather than very insist

416
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,220
Precision's rather than very insist divide this product in a nice form so if

417
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,899
divide this product in a nice form so if you like this with prestigious level two

418
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:07,330
you like this with prestigious level two one laughter - the product of two

419
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:10,600
one laughter - the product of two gaussians has a precision which the sum

420
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,060
gaussians has a precision which the sum of the two Precision's and I mean that

421
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,950
of the two Precision's and I mean that is given like that the normalization

422
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,350
is given like that the normalization postulate is not important even like

423
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,299
postulate is not important even like this

424
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:23,710
this I mean lot of the times right an

425
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,950
I mean lot of the times right an organization you know it is of no

426
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:36,340
organization you know it is of no interest really you an interest rate so

427
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,019
interest really you an interest rate so that we need to do is we need to compute

428
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:39,580
that we need to do is we need to compute to be able to apply the different

429
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,990
to be able to apply the different valuation right so if you look at the

430
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,769
valuation right so if you look at the belief of state note that first is the

431
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:47,110
belief of state note that first is the potential of access times all the

432
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:50,590
potential of access times all the messages arriving from its neighbors so

433
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,019
messages arriving from its neighbors so you need to be able to compute this in a

434
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:55,210
you need to be able to compute this in a closed form as a Gaussian and then

435
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,710
closed form as a Gaussian and then together with this product is another

436
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,529
together with this product is another closed out for Gaussian so you can write

437
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:01,750
closed out for Gaussian so you can write the belief of no excess as a stupid

438
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,190
the belief of no excess as a stupid thousand and this is what this

439
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,639
thousand and this is what this compression is done if you write the

440
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:10,620
compression is done if you write the messages to have a name USP and

441
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,570
messages to have a name USP and precision lambda is 3 and you multiply

442
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,580
precision lambda is 3 and you multiply all of this then you get a nice formula

443
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,930
all of this then you get a nice formula for the belief of know the test to be

444
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:23,350
for the belief of know the test to be long passed right one pass I remind you

445
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:28,299
long passed right one pass I remind you comes from the the precision of this

446
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:32,289
comes from the the precision of this single node potential plus the sum of

447
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:34,750
single node potential plus the sum of the Precision's of all the masses

448
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:41,049
the Precision's of all the masses from the neighbors of s to militate okay

449
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:44,080
from the neighbors of s to militate okay so the very nice 12 minutes a big dollar

450
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,980
so the very nice 12 minutes a big dollar must exist

451
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:49,780
must exist all right nothing and if you don't

452
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,390
all right nothing and if you don't update if you want to do message passing

453
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:56,460
update if you want to do message passing and you want update a message from st p

454
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,690
and you want update a message from st p you know this Bella right here

455
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,659
you know this Bella right here I don't assume things coming from above

456
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:04,090
I don't assume things coming from above and below because the idea is I am

457
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,909
and below because the idea is I am initializing everything with one or with

458
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:09,340
initializing everything with one or with some vouchers that you like and then I

459
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,930
some vouchers that you like and then I mystic messages with every note from

460
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,320
mystic messages with every note from other neighbors so the metas promise to

461
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,610
other neighbors so the metas promise to think much realized in excess of a

462
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,650
think much realized in excess of a mysterious in an integral form you have

463
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,140
mysterious in an integral form you have the senior potential access the

464
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,200
the senior potential access the potential of access honesty and then all

465
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,600
potential of access honesty and then all the messages that arrive from the

466
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,049
the messages that arrive from the neighbors of the no vest except nullity

467
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:35,799
neighbors of the no vest except nullity okay now I want to go through the

468
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:38,080
okay now I want to go through the algebra but effectively we just have

469
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,090
algebra but effectively we just have seen that this are Gaussian this to a

470
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,860
seen that this are Gaussian this to a social Gaussian this was also Gaussian

471
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,710
social Gaussian this was also Gaussian then there's a ssin in excess so

472
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,020
then there's a ssin in excess so technically at the end of the day you

473
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,049
technically at the end of the day you can have a recursive equation that gives

474
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:55,600
can have a recursive equation that gives you this messages as a clothespin

475
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,440
you this messages as a clothespin Gaussian with the given mean in a given

476
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,080
Gaussian with the given mean in a given procedure long term so effectively you

477
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,620
procedure long term so effectively you have this problem of scandi the program

478
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,470
have this problem of scandi the program to did the propagation called Gaussian

479
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,450
to did the propagation called Gaussian market on the fins it's really you know

480
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,890
market on the fins it's really you know the two lines

481
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:13,900


482
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:19,600
this is okay you should people not that you gave this homework okay all right so

483
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,799
you gave this homework okay all right so this is really all right now he realized

484
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:27,640
this is really all right now he realized yes to solve it - okay all right any

485
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,140
yes to solve it - okay all right any questions on this child now the only

486
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,539
questions on this child now the only thing I want to say right when you look

487
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:37,190
thing I want to say right when you look at these formulas for the way

488
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,260
at these formulas for the way dating messages somebody would stay but

489
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,930
dating messages somebody would stay but messages on a Gaussian right nothing is

490
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,130
messages on a Gaussian right nothing is so you're going to do tons of

491
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,820
so you're going to do tons of nonparametric early and then the idea is

492
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,310
nonparametric early and then the idea is can I give you a burst Gaussian matrix

493
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,260
can I give you a burst Gaussian matrix so you know what the problem will be

494
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,110
so you know what the problem will be when every message everything is a

495
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,090
when every message everything is a Gaussian mixture what happens when you

496
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,590
Gaussian mixture what happens when you want to apply a mixed in component with

497
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,460
want to apply a mixed in component with a lot of needs to go for it so multiply

498
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,050
a lot of needs to go for it so multiply you mix the three components with

499
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,540
you mix the three components with another mixtape let's ignacio components

500
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:13,730
another mixtape let's ignacio components how many components you get $30 a

501
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,900
how many components you get $30 a mixture with a lot of three browsers

502
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:21,110
mixture with a lot of three browsers what do you get nine and then humans

503
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,230
what do you get nine and then humans blind with another three all right

504
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,630
blind with another three all right or the Northern Line and it keeps going

505
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,300
or the Northern Line and it keeps going and going and so you get an explosion of

506
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,880
and going and so you get an explosion of thousand components so usually what

507
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,230
thousand components so usually what people do is they survive they take a

508
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,510
people do is they survive they take a mixture than genetic component and then

509
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,950
mixture than genetic component and then they project it to a mixture with three

510
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,720
they project it to a mixture with three components but again so you know some

511
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,640
components but again so you know some information okay and so the

512
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,300
information okay and so the probabilities even that try to you you

513
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,190
probabilities even that try to you you should for these five things don't

514
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,740
should for these five things don't automatically they are not necessarily

515
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,510
automatically they are not necessarily the exact right because you're gonna

516
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,420
the exact right because you're gonna listen information if you go from nine

517
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,800
listen information if you go from nine components two three you won't be able

518
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,430
components two three you won't be able to do this exactly okay buddy has been

519
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,230
to do this exactly okay buddy has been that it has been not for many years

520
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,840
that it has been not for many years almost 20 plus years people know how to

521
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,030
almost 20 plus years people know how to do this with Gaussian

522
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,040


523
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,620
all right

524
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:17,630


525
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:23,940
so mr. Higgs board with the name of nonparametric belief propagation

526
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,760
nonparametric belief propagation especially if you've used a mixed with

527
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,750
especially if you've used a mixed with nonparametric you know you're going to

528
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,460
nonparametric you know you're going to say I have a Gaussian mixture well but

529
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,280
say I have a Gaussian mixture well but you know you're not assuming any

530
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,870
you know you're not assuming any parametric form especially if the gods

531
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,340
parametric form especially if the gods are mixed you can there is many

532
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,580
are mixed you can there is many components as you wish right but also

533
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,600
components as you wish right but also nonparametric can imply distributions

534
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,840
nonparametric can imply distributions that you represent agree with some hopes

535
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,460
that you represent agree with some hopes well I cannot sort of a very nice way of

536
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,520
well I cannot sort of a very nice way of doing it message calculation so rather

537
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,750
doing it message calculation so rather than trying to fit them in some

538
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,760
than trying to fit them in some distribution for what you do is you

539
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,070
distribution for what you do is you represent them with particles and then

540
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,580
represent them with particles and then when you calculate the message updates

541
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,690
when you calculate the message updates you calculate the new particle

542
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,180
you calculate the new particle distribution to represent the questions

543
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,250
distribution to represent the questions okay so what's techniques actually have

544
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,060
okay so what's techniques actually have been extremely successful in in many

545
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,760
been extremely successful in in many dimension and I would say most only they

546
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,760
dimension and I would say most only they are the state of the art for this type

547
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,420
are the state of the art for this type of calculation and another way to do

548
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,170
of calculation and another way to do this

549
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,960
this nonparametric array is to give

550
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,750
nonparametric array is to give additional approximation okay so you

551
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:36,310
additional approximation okay so you vaccinate the distributions with some

552
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,560
vaccinate the distributions with some variation approximations and then the

553
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,280
variation approximations and then the question is how do you compute this new

554
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,480
question is how do you compute this new variation or approximation that's

555
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,930
variation or approximation that's something we will discuss later in the

556
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,220
something we will discuss later in the course we will spend maybe do a few

557
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,630
course we will spend maybe do a few lectures on the topic

558
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:51,640


559
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:57,299
by the way if the scoutship problem that I briefly went through and you will do

560
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:01,440
I briefly went through and you will do it in the home or if your mobile is sort

561
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,320
it in the home or if your mobile is sort of a linear dynamical system the

562
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,970
of a linear dynamical system the questions that you get with masters

563
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,310
questions that you get with masters passing etc become actually to be

564
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:11,760
passing etc become actually to be identical to thermal printer II so you

565
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,379
identical to thermal printer II so you know this message passing algorithm will

566
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:16,520
know this message passing algorithm will give you exactly the same answers that

567
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,149
give you exactly the same answers that come the printer does the questions will

568
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:22,619
come the printer does the questions will more complicated you know and

569
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:25,379
more complicated you know and conceptually but actually much way much

570
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,500
conceptually but actually much way much much more elegant than the derivation of

571
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,010
much more elegant than the derivation of the Kalman filter equations okay and so

572
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,780
the Kalman filter equations okay and so we will actually review and lots of

573
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,730
we will actually review and lots of these things because data simulation is

574
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,889
these things because data simulation is important so I worship to get this

575
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:40,590
important so I worship to get this concept in detail as we go through the

576
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,080
concept in detail as we go through the course

577
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:49,080
course okay so we have 25 minutes to finish the

578
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,490
okay so we have 25 minutes to finish the junction 3 algorithm that we discussed

579
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,710
junction 3 algorithm that we discussed and basically I'm not going to do

580
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,590
and basically I'm not going to do anything you know some very

581
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,880
anything you know some very parameterization of the Albert and then

582
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,730
parameterization of the Albert and then one cute example of applying the

583
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,280
one cute example of applying the junction tree algorithm to the hidden

584
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,700
junction tree algorithm to the hidden Markov models and into the head of so if

585
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,770
Markov models and into the head of so if you start let's say with a directed

586
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,170
you start let's say with a directed graph to get a junction tree the first

587
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,700
graph to get a junction tree the first thing you have to do is marelize and

588
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,349
thing you have to do is marelize and once you realize you replace all the

589
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:24,990
once you realize you replace all the directed edges with undirected edges so

590
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,099
directed edges with undirected edges so here is organization making the path

591
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:33,060
here is organization making the path Tektronix Plagne this red line this is

592
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,070
Tektronix Plagne this red line this is the factorization of the direction graph

593
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,080
the factorization of the direction graph and this is where they have from the

594
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,109
and this is where they have from the undirected graph so you can the color

595
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:43,080
undirected graph so you can the color supposed to represent we want one

596
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,450
supposed to represent we want one correspondence I mean really that's not

597
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,180
correspondence I mean really that's not an issue but this probability here is

598
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,490
an issue but this probability here is nice high potential

599
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,680
nice high potential etcetera etcetera

600
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:53,690


601
00:35:53,690 --> 00:36:01,460
this is a bit more complicated example export history planet so basically have

602
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,410
export history planet so basically have to marry all of them straights not

603
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,780
to marry all of them straights not sufficient to marry actually x2 and you

604
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,250
sufficient to marry actually x2 and you say x1 is the husband of you and excuse

605
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,020
say x1 is the husband of you and excuse the hospital of extreme that x1 is a car

606
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,190
the hospital of extreme that x1 is a car politics the daily right no they have to

607
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:18,230
politics the daily right no they have to have an individual certificate of

608
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,660
have an individual certificate of marriage here so we need to connect x1

609
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,900
marriage here so we need to connect x1 x3 also okay then so this is how the

610
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,360
x3 also okay then so this is how the undirected graph will look like if you

611
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,520
undirected graph will look like if you have evidence we want to discuss this

612
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,250
have evidence we want to discuss this really there is nothing specific you

613
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,920
really there is nothing specific you need to do but take slices of these

614
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,600
need to do but take slices of these potentials okay

615
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,000
potentials okay by fixing to the given values whatever

616
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,250
by fixing to the given values whatever known to travelers you have so in this

617
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,740
known to travelers you have so in this case it's a 4 X 3 and X 4 are given

618
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,020
case it's a 4 X 3 and X 4 are given effectively you take a two-dimensional

619
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,390
effectively you take a two-dimensional slice from let's say this one dimension

620
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:54,020
slice from let's say this one dimension table human dimensions lines etc and in

621
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,320
table human dimensions lines etc and in principle the plane nodes in this

622
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,020
principle the plane nodes in this problem become X 1 X 2 X 5 X 6 and

623
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:04,280
problem become X 1 X 2 X 5 X 6 and excedrin and literally you can think of

624
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,300
excedrin and literally you can think of this equation X 1 X 2 I'll separate it

625
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,030
this equation X 1 X 2 I'll separate it from X 5 X 6 and X 7

626
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,500
from X 5 X 6 and X 7 so maybe you can do this sort of

627
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,900
so maybe you can do this sort of inference short opener in a very trivial

628
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,040
inference short opener in a very trivial manner you don't really have to mix

629
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,720
manner you don't really have to mix things together that don't depend on

630
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:36,110
things together that don't depend on each other the next step was to let me

631
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,380
each other the next step was to let me see this written here already for

632
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,390
see this written here already for buildin well so there was another

633
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,400
buildin well so there was another Stefan's maybe going to come in the next

634
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,299
Stefan's maybe going to come in the next slide because it's not a problem on this

635
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:48,489
slide because it's not a problem on this pictograph what was the other step that

636
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:50,489
pictograph what was the other step that was very essential

637
00:37:50,489 --> 00:37:52,900
was very essential after modernization what do we have to

638
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,410
after modernization what do we have to do to create clicks that they are not

639
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,819
do to create clicks that they are not you know they don't lead to you just

640
00:37:57,819 --> 00:38:00,989
you know they don't lead to you just basically then was the best word we use

641
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:05,259
basically then was the best word we use to get a junction tree we have to do

642
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:09,759
to get a junction tree we have to do what to the graph so example let's say

643
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:12,429
what to the graph so example let's say in my undirected graph if this was not

644
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:15,640
in my undirected graph if this was not there when you're going to be happy if

645
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:22,920
there when you're going to be happy if you had today was not there that was

646
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,420
you had today was not there that was what is the step you have to do

647
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:29,499
what is the step you have to do basically before you start getting you

648
00:38:29,499 --> 00:38:38,100
basically before you start getting you know your junction tree yep

649
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,110


650
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:41,580
no cartographer dr. Graf left them behind us

651
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,300
behind us what's the war I said not supplying us

652
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:55,160
what's the war I said not supplying us here

653
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:55,170


654
00:38:55,170 --> 00:39:35,250
you know one of them which was much more plates okay and the possibilities

655
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:43,160
plates okay and the possibilities basically as we wish I think in okay

656
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,170


657
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:54,300
increasing this this we have to satisfy a fundamental property to make this

658
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,030
a fundamental property to make this problem consistent and we will discuss

659
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,940
problem consistent and we will discuss this with examples today so what was the

660
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,840
this with examples today so what was the exact property that we need to satisfy

661
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:09,349
exact property that we need to satisfy to make this sort of car to work crops

662
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:09,359


663
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:21,690
when I look at this tree here I noticed this first node with a click a VD in

664
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,420
this first node with a click a VD in common so what did we say needs to

665
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,670
common so what did we say needs to happen in between this node and that

666
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:32,490
happen in between this node and that node if they serve no be the whoever of

667
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,609
node if they serve no be the whoever of no change in the junction tree to

668
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:38,810
no change in the junction tree to subscribe well you need to have what D

669
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:43,320
subscribe well you need to have what D ok whenever I receive information going

670
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,680
ok whenever I receive information going to propagate

671
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,890
to propagate from here to there to a baby it's going

672
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,630
from here to there to a baby it's going to mediate notes having no idea they

673
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,390
to mediate notes having no idea they don't care about this okay so you need

674
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,059
don't care about this okay so you need basically when you cancel you need to

675
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:58,240
basically when you cancel you need to satisfy that property of what you've

676
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,020
satisfy that property of what you've been taught now we actually reduce the

677
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,609
been taught now we actually reduce the concept of the separatist and the

678
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:06,130
concept of the separatist and the Cifaretto sphere are the squares

679
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,370
Cifaretto sphere are the squares knowledge that contain the Kuna notes

680
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:12,460
knowledge that contain the Kuna notes between the Terra Mystica VD and the

681
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,319
between the Terra Mystica VD and the click this again in this case are the

682
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,290
click this again in this case are the notes B and D and the converse operators

683
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:21,700
notes B and D and the converse operators and don't oppress them will come out or

684
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,130
and don't oppress them will come out or anything like that because clear every

685
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,589
anything like that because clear every note including the separator subjects

686
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:29,859
note including the separator subjects basically right I'm sorry mmm these are

687
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:31,839
basically right I'm sorry mmm these are the common laws between those two clicks

688
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,240
the common laws between those two clicks but basically there is no factor so

689
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,400
but basically there is no factor so anything like that the way we did in

690
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,300
anything like that the way we did in fact or not

691
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,420
fact or not now may say well but racist if it's a

692
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,819
now may say well but racist if it's a great comes with a potential right so

693
00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:48,130
great comes with a potential right so that sense you can think representation

694
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,260
that sense you can think representation on the photograph but I'm not going to

695
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,150
on the photograph but I'm not going to use the concept today because you know

696
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:56,079
use the concept today because you know the junction tree as a tree of with

697
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,990
the junction tree as a tree of with white nodes immediately comes with its

698
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,970
white nodes immediately comes with its potential all right so these are the

699
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:05,940
potential all right so these are the separators alright and then you know

700
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,740
separators alright and then you know basically let's say without discussing

701
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,050
basically let's say without discussing about how we do inference right let's

702
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:13,300
about how we do inference right let's look at this know the conflict and this

703
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,790
look at this know the conflict and this note that self notes beardy

704
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:18,880
note that self notes beardy what do you think the importance of the

705
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,980
what do you think the importance of the parameter in this case what does it is

706
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,050
parameter in this case what does it is going to help us to remind us at least

707
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:29,740
going to help us to remind us at least walk but when the snake interact what

708
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,620
walk but when the snake interact what Lincoln updates information of this

709
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,040
Lincoln updates information of this click and the other way around

710
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:42,010
click and the other way around happens on what note

711
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:42,020


712
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:49,790
maybe the only notes that they're home to them so in other ways when this time

713
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,590
to them so in other ways when this time okay a masters only we see whether it

714
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:55,610
okay a masters only we see whether it means to this click this TV is no

715
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:58,010
means to this click this TV is no medicine to mess about every because be

716
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,670
medicine to mess about every because be stirred be doesn't care about it it has

717
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,710
stirred be doesn't care about it it has to be only on the notes that are in the

718
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,950
to be only on the notes that are in the separate okay

719
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:10,010
separate okay and there is a mathematical issue that

720
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,380
and there is a mathematical issue that we need to specify here and we will

721
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:17,110
we need to specify here and we will citizen in examples right somehow

722
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:22,100
citizen in examples right somehow I mean business this is let say a

723
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,590
I mean business this is let say a believer countries on potential the

724
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,450
believer countries on potential the separate on the logic on some potential

725
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:29,240
separate on the logic on some potential in a container you can guess maybe that

726
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,460
in a container you can guess maybe that invisible jurisdiction with respect to

727
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,890
invisible jurisdiction with respect to any of the potential of the trickery be

728
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:38,330
any of the potential of the trickery be be finishing up I mean the potential of

729
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,310
be finishing up I mean the potential of the separator be they will be the

730
00:43:40,310 --> 00:44:00,830
the separator be they will be the marginalization of the see but what is

731
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:03,020
marginalization of the see but what is the rational potential do not agree with

732
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,920
the rational potential do not agree with each other that's what the algorithm

733
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,450
each other that's what the algorithm actually try to obtain but consistency

734
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:13,700
actually try to obtain but consistency that makes the two organizations equal

735
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,510
that makes the two organizations equal to each other

736
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:17,660
to each other so in some sense having dissipators

737
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,050
so in some sense having dissipators that's what they will do so the sending

738
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,990
that's what they will do so the sending message is basically this two clicks to

739
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:26,300
message is basically this two clicks to each other in a way that when given two

740
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,120
each other in a way that when given two allies this with respect to a and you

741
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,130
allies this with respect to a and you marginalize this with respect to see

742
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,590
marginalize this with respect to see somehow you can get a consistent

743
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:34,260
somehow you can get a consistent calculate

744
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:40,980
calculate of the separator for then shall be in

745
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:46,230
of the separator for then shall be in the process yes absolutely and this is

746
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:49,280
the process yes absolutely and this is what we will discuss today yes so we

747
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,650
what we will discuss today yes so we think and then it was talking to rating

748
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,750
think and then it was talking to rating you sent me a message I sent you a

749
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,310
you sent me a message I sent you a message everybody sends messages to each

750
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:01,920
message everybody sends messages to each other until we're all happy okay so

751
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,780
other until we're all happy okay so where's my desk I told you way too much

752
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,810
where's my desk I told you way too much information so let's as the plots come

753
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:10,650
information so let's as the plots come again we will see this again so we get

754
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:14,100
again we will see this again so we get the main so then this is the Train on

755
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,010
the main so then this is the Train on directed and you can see the

756
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:21,000
directed and you can see the triangulation process all right so we

757
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,810
triangulation process all right so we connected this block if the edges are

758
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:26,160
connected this block if the edges are this is the definition of the trip and

759
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,320
this is the definition of the trip and effectively the message that I think we

760
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:51,360
effectively the message that I think we passed last lecture was that so there

761
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,540
passed last lecture was that so there are many ways we can pose some what we

762
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,010
are many ways we can pose some what we said we are going to choose the one that

763
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:02,280
said we are going to choose the one that maximizes something and what is the many

764
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,460
maximizes something and what is the many challenges which one should be used so

765
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,280
challenges which one should be used so in this case we have this trade that has

766
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,900
in this case we have this trade that has two separate first each of them has two

767
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,030
two separate first each of them has two elements and then we have this 3 which

768
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,630
elements and then we have this 3 which is 30 minute and he has one element of

769
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:18,600
is 30 minute and he has one element of this separator and turned out whatever

770
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:24,310
this separator and turned out whatever you like

771
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:24,320


772
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:30,140
we have to redefine the maximum spanning tree with you know we will call it the

773
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,120
tree with you know we will call it the junction tree and when we say the

774
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,220
junction tree and when we say the maximum spanning tree maximal with

775
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:40,520
maximum spanning tree maximal with respect to what he has too much my son

776
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,690
respect to what he has too much my son tree so if you look at verse days what

777
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:54,270
tree so if you look at verse days what is the time between the two three

778
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:54,280


779
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,710
well the answer is you have to look at the separator

780
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:07,950
what is littering the separators invest twit P and in this the number of no all

781
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,130
twit P and in this the number of no all right so here we have 2 + 10 + 2 + 2 is

782
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:22,320
right so here we have 2 + 10 + 2 + 2 is greater than 1 + 2 3 and these lots of

783
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,180
greater than 1 + 2 3 and these lots of heuristic algorithms on how to do this

784
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:28,110
heuristic algorithms on how to do this the actual calculation is a very hard

785
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:31,740
the actual calculation is a very hard one you know for a complex 3 but using

786
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,070
one you know for a complex 3 but using the empirical methods give a job ok so

787
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:36,960
the empirical methods give a job ok so the natural trick has the largest total

788
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,540
the natural trick has the largest total separator of cardinality in this case

789
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:44,610
separator of cardinality in this case for example you can notice here is the

790
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:48,750
for example you can notice here is the cardinality here is still so 10 plus 2

791
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:52,920
cardinality here is still so 10 plus 2 is greater than 1 plus I'm sorry 1 plus

792
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:59,640
is greater than 1 plus I'm sorry 1 plus plus 2 okay in the running intersection

793
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,070
plus 2 okay in the running intersection property is what we discussed before it

794
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,800
property is what we discussed before it you know this self between this and this

795
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,410
you know this self between this and this next it has to be stare constant but any

796
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:10,320
next it has to be stare constant but any other click in between on the path okay

797
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:16,500
other click in between on the path okay so I just copy this 3 seconds before I

798
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,200
so I just copy this 3 seconds before I came from the lecture you know I always

799
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,640
came from the lecture you know I always try to find links for you to read more

800
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,610
try to find links for you to read more about these things right but not sure if

801
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,310
about these things right but not sure if you actually do but so stratosphere is

802
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:31,700
you actually do but so stratosphere is an empirical law group on how to find

803
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,830
an empirical law group on how to find this maximal spanning tree and and the

804
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:37,620
this maximal spanning tree and and the algorithm is just under the name of this

805
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,230
algorithm is just under the name of this crystal stir algorithm that is really

806
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:42,030
crystal stir algorithm that is really sort of a heuristic algorithm that works

807
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:45,300
sort of a heuristic algorithm that works in not change not just for Junction

808
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,220
in not change not just for Junction trees but this is very useful in many

809
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,710
trees but this is very useful in many other contexts as well so you know if

810
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,900
other contexts as well so you know if you hit this you will come up to this

811
00:48:51,900 --> 00:49:04,710
you hit this you will come up to this live animation and an example and region

812
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:07,500
live animation and an example and region of the problem now and revisit the

813
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,510
of the problem now and revisit the junction tree algorithm using the

814
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:13,380
junction tree algorithm using the separated potentials so I'm going to

815
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,170
separated potentials so I'm going to cross paths with a parameterization that

816
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:18,690
cross paths with a parameterization that of the Joint Distribution that looks

817
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:20,840
of the Joint Distribution that looks like this relation that you see here

818
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,360
like this relation that you see here that is the product of the potentials of

819
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,800
that is the product of the potentials of for the maximal cliques

820
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,800
for the maximal cliques on my junction tree divided by the

821
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,930
on my junction tree divided by the product of the potentials of the

822
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:34,950
product of the potentials of the separators and in conceptual and please

823
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,170
separators and in conceptual and please does this make sense right why you

824
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,700
does this make sense right why you develop here by the potential of the

825
00:49:38,700 --> 00:50:07,950
develop here by the potential of the separators

826
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:07,960


827
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:15,400
doesn't look like this I gave you a preview way to start defining the

828
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,950
preview way to start defining the superlative the different one so these

829
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:20,230
superlative the different one so these potentials you take know from the simple

830
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:27,880
potentials you take know from the simple interpretation equals one discussion

831
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,470
interpretation equals one discussion here basically first operators are one

832
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:31,780
here basically first operators are one and you can affiliate the connect

833
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:35,319
and you can affiliate the connect potentials in your original undirected

834
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:38,170
potentials in your original undirected graph with the clip potentials that you

835
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:40,930
graph with the clip potentials that you used in the junction 3 then the

836
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:43,270
used in the junction 3 then the numerator in that expression is actually

837
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,640
numerator in that expression is actually the joint probability bution of all the

838
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:50,109
the joint probability bution of all the variables all right so mr. very general

839
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:52,780
variables all right so mr. very general expression I'm going to use if you are

840
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,980
expression I'm going to use if you are confused as to why is that consider that

841
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,780
confused as to why is that consider that I'm starting with the denominator to be

842
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,970
I'm starting with the denominator to be equal to answer there's no issue ok and

843
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:03,880
equal to answer there's no issue ok and then we would see what happens as we go

844
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:15,069
then we would see what happens as we go along okay you know the parameterization

845
00:51:15,069 --> 00:51:17,680
along okay you know the parameterization we discussed on the last lecture but the

846
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,230
we discussed on the last lecture but the equations are identical in other ways if

847
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,910
equations are identical in other ways if you put the two x's next to each other

848
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:25,660
you put the two x's next to each other and you look at the equations they plan

849
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,849
and you look at the equations they plan to start with but then you know with

850
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:30,190
to start with but then you know with some thinking they're identical so here

851
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:34,480
some thinking they're identical so here we have separator right everywhere okay

852
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,980
we have separator right everywhere okay we do not have this in the previous

853
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,960
we do not have this in the previous lecture so let's so we're going to start

854
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,750
lecture so let's so we're going to start planting messages basically from the

855
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,319
planting messages basically from the links to vary

856
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:48,300
links to vary to tell you the way we have done it in

857
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,839
to tell you the way we have done it in the past and so let's tell the message

858
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:58,589
the past and so let's tell the message from a curriculum die to click no J did

859
00:51:58,589 --> 00:52:01,470
from a curriculum die to click no J did we stay by the initial mr. political

860
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:04,109
we stay by the initial mr. political potential that no information no the

861
00:52:04,109 --> 00:52:11,220
potential that no information no the eyes consent today is about which no so

862
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,660
eyes consent today is about which no so if I understand some information from

863
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,400
if I understand some information from right answer if your information a

864
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,220
right answer if your information a consent is the information related to an

865
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,010
consent is the information related to an updated the knowledge that are shared by

866
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:24,089
updated the knowledge that are shared by CI n CJ I am going to send two giant

867
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:27,990
CI n CJ I am going to send two giant firm ation what some knows this click

868
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:30,839
firm ation what some knows this click contains blood I'm not contain is to say

869
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,780
contains blood I'm not contain is to say because that's your anyone so not only

870
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,089
because that's your anyone so not only are going to sent information that is

871
00:52:36,089 --> 00:52:38,510
are going to sent information that is related with the current variables

872
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:41,220
related with the current variables effectively what I need to do is the

873
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,410
effectively what I need to do is the message I'm gonna sell to my today will

874
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,410
message I'm gonna sell to my today will be the potential of you know I defined

875
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:49,410
be the potential of you know I defined by the flick of NotI where I integrate

876
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:51,540
by the flick of NotI where I integrate all the variables about the variables

877
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:57,290
all the variables about the variables that are involved in the separator

878
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:57,300


879
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:23,880
extent so we sent information contained here but this point to the local

880
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,339
here but this point to the local potentials for each of these nodes and

881
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:29,069
potentials for each of these nodes and the ideas well you know take the old

882
00:53:29,069 --> 00:53:33,059
the ideas well you know take the old potentials time if this is propagation

883
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:35,040
potentials time if this is propagation from the list of nodes times are the

884
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,470
from the list of nodes times are the messages that are coming from the times

885
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:42,070
messages that are coming from the times of Pi I mean on the side

886
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:42,080


887
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:49,220
well so let me say this just for update all right you know the picture let me

888
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,060
all right you know the picture let me see again

889
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:52,070


890
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:58,580
so this okay Charlie they things to I all right maybe this

891
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:00,530
they things to I all right maybe this picture is know that proper to general

892
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:08,210
picture is know that proper to general dating see I actually you know was it

893
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:10,790
dating see I actually you know was it thank you here actually thinking if it's

894
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:14,780
thank you here actually thinking if it's because me from business out scare okay

895
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:18,200
because me from business out scare okay so basically all the messages of the

896
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,260
so basically all the messages of the propagated from the children of no guy

897
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:24,560
propagated from the children of no guy okay so basically you know I had one

898
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,440
okay so basically you know I had one graphing they have to use it you can use

899
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,000
graphing they have to use it you can use the industries and give them the right

900
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:37,790
the industries and give them the right interpretation of the way you wanted a

901
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:40,580
interpretation of the way you wanted a physical IJ and because mister natality

902
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,910
physical IJ and because mister natality processed what we need to do is we need

903
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:51,260
processed what we need to do is we need to update the messages without basically

904
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,650
to update the messages without basically separate the potential okay and so look

905
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,930
separate the potential okay and so look at this equation carefully and and

906
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:59,150
at this equation carefully and and trying to give some personal meaning to

907
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:05,090
trying to give some personal meaning to what it takes

908
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:05,100


909
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:11,300
so this is sort of a definition right but this you can think of this being the

910
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:17,500
but this you can think of this being the amazing potential of the separator s9j

911
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:17,510


912
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:26,110
so what this equation says the other information of the fast from Lodi today

913
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:29,000
information of the fast from Lodi today we have to integrate over modernist

914
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,770
we have to integrate over modernist except the ones contain a separate them

915
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,750
except the ones contain a separate them but the notice here there's a division

916
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:48,830
but the notice here there's a division from surprise

917
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:48,840


918
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:58,130
and again this is related to what your concept

919
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:58,140


920
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:02,769
I'm gonna convince you with a precise calculation why this works right but

921
00:56:02,769 --> 00:56:05,930
calculation why this works right but shared this division is very similar to

922
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:07,430
shared this division is very similar to the division who has the belief

923
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,680
the division who has the belief propagation algorithm respectively why

924
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:21,200
propagation algorithm respectively why do we have this in the denominator

925
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:21,210


926
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:27,680
you didn't tell Commonwealth my message from Jake are we no one can doubt

927
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,230
from Jake are we no one can doubt melancholy the message that basically

928
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,599
melancholy the message that basically the Bison taste of chains so this

929
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:39,160
the Bison taste of chains so this calculation

930
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:39,170


931
00:56:39,170 --> 00:57:46,660
okay okay all right

932
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:46,670


933
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:53,660
everything from very acceptable semester project so then I'm gonna days once I

934
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:56,030
project so then I'm gonna days once I have updated this operator potential I

935
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:59,120
have updated this operator potential I am going to update the potential of the

936
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:03,349
am going to update the potential of the Qaddafi and the real dated is the old

937
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:07,130
Qaddafi and the real dated is the old potential of trig W times the abated

938
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:09,620
potential of trig W times the abated separated people potential divided by

939
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:12,829
separated people potential divided by the original separated potential okay

940
00:58:12,829 --> 00:58:14,120
the original separated potential okay that sounds good

941
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:18,970
that sounds good we will show right what obviously

942
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:21,400
we will show right what obviously passing messages can wait to battle you

943
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,290
passing messages can wait to battle you so the potential if there's no way to

944
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:36,130
so the potential if there's no way to change to another man exactly so let's

945
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:37,930
change to another man exactly so let's see how we're gonna send those Mexican

946
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:40,000
see how we're gonna send those Mexican value T to V so we're gonna have to

947
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,940
value T to V so we're gonna have to update the potential of the separator

948
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,680
update the potential of the separator how do we do this by taking the

949
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,080
how do we do this by taking the potential of W which remember was update

950
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,450
potential of W which remember was update me to this and we're going to integrate

951
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,400
me to this and we're going to integrate all the vitamins buffers in the

952
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,849
all the vitamins buffers in the separator and then we are going to

953
00:58:54,849 --> 00:58:57,730
separator and then we are going to update the potential of V which remember

954
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:00,660
update the potential of V which remember was this and how we're going to update

955
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:03,570
was this and how we're going to update there may be potential of the separator

956
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:06,460
there may be potential of the separator divided by the previous value of the

957
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,370
divided by the previous value of the potential of the separators times try

958
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:11,980
potential of the separators times try the star which is this and the potential

959
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,980
the star which is this and the potential of Gavi will remain the updated to start

960
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:19,410
of Gavi will remain the updated to start swimming with what it was before so

961
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:23,680
swimming with what it was before so messages from V to W and I'm updating

962
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,260
messages from V to W and I'm updating the separator potential the davia

963
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,120
the separator potential the davia potential the V potential really doesn't

964
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,420
potential the V potential really doesn't change and then messages from EE here to

965
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:31,960
change and then messages from EE here to me

966
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,300
me I am updating the separation it separate

967
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,150
I am updating the separation it separate the potential the potential of V and the

968
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:44,440
the potential the potential of V and the potential now he doesn't say why this

969
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:56,290
potential now he doesn't say why this works most - those that belong in ask so

970
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:59,020
works most - those that belong in ask so well so this is probably double stars

971
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:03,849
well so this is probably double stars try plant-eating right this is this this

972
01:00:03,849 --> 01:00:06,599
try plant-eating right this is this this comes outside the summation sign

973
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:12,400
comes outside the summation sign hispanist IV and what is this this is pH

974
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,550
hispanist IV and what is this this is pH are you still at the discount of tau

975
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:18,310
are you still at the discount of tau this is the second half length of the

976
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:21,160
this is the second half length of the separator potential which is what is the

977
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,230
separator potential which is what is the summation of all the nodes but as from

978
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:27,060
summation of all the nodes but as from darling you

979
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:27,070


980
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:52,970
[Applause]

981
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:52,980


982
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:57,840
the potential of the separator is the same regardless my completed my

983
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,849
same regardless my completed my marginalization of the potential on the

984
01:00:59,849 --> 01:01:03,930
marginalization of the potential on the left or the potential overall so

985
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:07,380
left or the potential overall so basically by you can think of this you

986
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,400
basically by you can think of this you know a forward and a mess disgusting I

987
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,720
know a forward and a mess disgusting I have achieved basically with some

988
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:25,310
have achieved basically with some consistency which is exactly what I work

989
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:25,320


990
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:31,290
is based on the papers this consistency between the potentials defined by the

991
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:33,930
between the potentials defined by the clicks if you don't have this sort of

992
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:38,010
clicks if you don't have this sort of explicitly you know somehow still you

993
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:40,650
explicitly you know somehow still you will need to satisfy some consistency

994
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:43,560
will need to satisfy some consistency relations but here they are sort of

995
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:51,210
relations but here they are sort of straightforward basically for the

996
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,880
straightforward basically for the previous picture this the slide because

997
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:59,720
previous picture this the slide because I'm not going to repeat them again the

998
01:01:59,720 --> 01:01:59,730


999
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:05,490
you cannot say you sent messages from here to there so we have to update

1000
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:09,540
here to there so we have to update basically the potential of the separator

1001
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:13,290
basically the potential of the separator this is what we did then we have to

1002
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:17,090
this is what we did then we have to update the potential of this click by

1003
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:19,260
update the potential of this click by multiplying the previous values of the

1004
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,210
multiplying the previous values of the potential with size start dividing

1005
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:24,020
potential with size start dividing lifestyle and you remember we start with

1006
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,880
lifestyle and you remember we start with the separator potential to be equal to 1

1007
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,809
the separator potential to be equal to 1 and then we do the markers

1008
01:02:29,809 --> 01:02:34,170
and then we do the markers so he marginalised say I start for

1009
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:36,390
so he marginalised say I start for everything except mr. Perret embody most

1010
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:38,910
everything except mr. Perret embody most and then you have take as we spend Isis

1011
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:40,680
and then you have take as we spend Isis provide to jail you update the potential

1012
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:44,160
provide to jail you update the potential of J this factor and at the end of the

1013
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:49,640
of J this factor and at the end of the day if you actually consistency and when

1014
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,609
day if you actually consistency and when you know doing all of these calculations

1015
01:02:52,609 --> 01:02:56,519
you know doing all of these calculations the marginal distribution and you know

1016
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:04,200
the marginal distribution and you know the variables remains unchanged okay and

1017
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,609
the variables remains unchanged okay and I think there is some put in the slides

1018
01:03:05,609 --> 01:03:09,510
I think there is some put in the slides that shows that but basically very we

1019
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:11,309
that shows that but basically very we don't play with the joint probability

1020
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:13,440
don't play with the joint probability distribution with all these local

1021
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,789
distribution with all these local updates because the local updates

1022
01:03:14,789 --> 01:03:16,920
updates because the local updates maintain the joyful of in distribution

1023
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:22,010
maintain the joyful of in distribution to be to be the same during iterations

1024
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:26,420
to be to be the same during iterations and actually chemists you know I am I

1025
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:29,370
and actually chemists you know I am I just said with the trivial example that

1026
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:32,940
just said with the trivial example that perfect does not change basically in

1027
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,740
perfect does not change basically in either the forward of the backwards that

1028
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:42,510
either the forward of the backwards that it remains the same okay I have 30

1029
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:46,309
it remains the same okay I have 30 minutes and I'm going to do one example

1030
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:48,569
minutes and I'm going to do one example the struggles it sounds like another

1031
01:03:48,569 --> 01:03:50,250
the struggles it sounds like another killed right but I wanted to show you

1032
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:54,150
killed right but I wanted to show you how you can actually apply this to real

1033
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:56,069
how you can actually apply this to real problems so this is cohesion Markov

1034
01:03:56,069 --> 01:03:58,109
problems so this is cohesion Markov models that I will start discussing

1035
01:03:58,109 --> 01:04:01,079
models that I will start discussing detail on Thursday but we're going to do

1036
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:02,519
detail on Thursday but we're going to do the junction tree algorithm with the

1037
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:08,840
the junction tree algorithm with the separators for the hmm model today

1038
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:08,850


1039
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:16,400
for those who have not seen it the hmm LD - can we have some sugar dynamics so

1040
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,470
LD - can we have some sugar dynamics so there's notes that the shielded waffle

1041
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:21,170
there's notes that the shielded waffle is the system state that evolves with

1042
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:23,900
is the system state that evolves with some dynamics and right now we assumed

1043
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,360
some dynamics and right now we assumed that the modern smart for bein so the

1044
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,890
that the modern smart for bein so the probability of being on a given state

1045
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:30,380
probability of being on a given state here depends only on the state that you

1046
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,030
here depends only on the state that you were before and it's defined by this

1047
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:35,060
were before and it's defined by this transition that you say hey and somehow

1048
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:37,640
transition that you say hey and somehow you want to infer this hidden states by

1049
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,700
you want to infer this hidden states by some large observations that I volunteer

1050
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:44,180
some large observations that I volunteer y0 y1 white the white pocket empty or

1051
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:46,580
y0 y1 white the white pocket empty or something like that so we want to do

1052
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:50,750
something like that so we want to do sort of the junction 3 algorithm and in

1053
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:54,280
sort of the junction 3 algorithm and in the process you can discover the

1054
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,690
the process you can discover the probabilistic after matters all the

1055
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:59,960
probabilistic after matters all the equations from you know you may not know

1056
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:02,480
equations from you know you may not know about Kalman filtering in a show you can

1057
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,520
about Kalman filtering in a show you can derive any sort of extensions to come a

1058
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,350
derive any sort of extensions to come a filtering your interest rate for the

1059
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:22,370
filtering your interest rate for the shuttle distribution I using a cure but

1060
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:25,040
shuttle distribution I using a cure but somehow I have to change the slides so

1061
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:28,220
somehow I have to change the slides so this parity scare the durations of Y so

1062
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:30,650
this parity scare the durations of Y so the joint of a minute radiation of Q and

1063
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:33,290
the joint of a minute radiation of Q and y is given by the probability of the

1064
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:35,000
y is given by the probability of the initial stage which is the transition

1065
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,330
initial stage which is the transition probabilities from - t2 t2 plus 1 and

1066
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:41,780
probabilities from - t2 t2 plus 1 and this is the observation model many most

1067
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:42,560
this is the observation model many most probably hoped

1068
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,170
probably hoped without right some sort of just a little

1069
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:51,860
without right some sort of just a little bit all right so again I want you as an

1070
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:56,510
bit all right so again I want you as an overkill application right because you

1071
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:57,920
overkill application right because you can't apply something that is very

1072
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,490
can't apply something that is very general a trivial problem

1073
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:00,780
general a trivial problem we know the answer they sound like

1074
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:08,690
we know the answer they sound like another kid but it's a very good

1075
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:08,700


1076
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:16,980
position ethics AI J the in the join distribution

1077
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:20,099
ethics AI J the in the join distribution here right I can write it's playable

1078
01:06:20,099 --> 01:06:23,130
here right I can write it's playable this is the probability of QT plus 1

1079
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:26,130
this is the probability of QT plus 1 given Q T so we find all the metrics say

1080
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:30,120
given Q T so we find all the metrics say which components a I'm very defined the

1081
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:33,990
which components a I'm very defined the way is secure so I go from state I time

1082
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:40,260
way is secure so I go from state I time step T you know state J on T plus 1 I

1083
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:46,849
step T you know state J on T plus 1 I can write this as a IJ 250 I 50 plus 1 J

1084
01:06:46,849 --> 01:06:49,589
can write this as a IJ 250 I 50 plus 1 J from and I'm assuming here I have a

1085
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:52,109
from and I'm assuming here I have a multinomial distribution so the values

1086
01:06:52,109 --> 01:06:54,359
multinomial distribution so the values of the states can be n different values

1087
01:06:54,359 --> 01:07:00,380
of the states can be n different values of its time then you should ask I mean

1088
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:06,930
of its time then you should ask I mean isn't this triply eyes except you know

1089
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:09,210
isn't this triply eyes except you know some of them would be 1 and that's what

1090
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:11,060
some of them would be 1 and that's what we want they will give you the correct

1091
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:14,550
we want they will give you the correct element for my transition matrix AI J

1092
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:21,089
element for my transition matrix AI J there's nothing faster okay again the

1093
01:07:21,089 --> 01:07:23,370
there's nothing faster okay again the for identification state to ask this

1094
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:25,200
for identification state to ask this transition probabilities from the

1095
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,700
transition probabilities from the dynamics and times of the vegetable so

1096
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:32,400
dynamics and times of the vegetable so the when we do states a state-space

1097
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,780
the when we do states a state-space models in the next week or so the

1098
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:39,329
models in the next week or so the fundamental problems in the context of

1099
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:42,000
fundamental problems in the context of data simulation is basically if you're

1100
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,030
data simulation is basically if you're given don't define P to estimate the

1101
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:47,220
given don't define P to estimate the state of time T that's what is called

1102
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,370
state of time T that's what is called the sintering problem the prediction

1103
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,140
the sintering problem the prediction problem is if you are given data up to

1104
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:55,549
problem is if you are given data up to time s to the predictions of habit

1105
01:07:55,549 --> 01:07:57,890
time s to the predictions of habit raishin but the prediction problem and

1106
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:00,439
raishin but the prediction problem and then the smithing problem is if you are

1107
01:08:00,439 --> 01:08:03,439
then the smithing problem is if you are given observations from now on till

1108
01:08:03,439 --> 01:08:05,660
given observations from now on till tomorrow can we predict distributing

1109
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:08,660
tomorrow can we predict distributing what the state is so here using a lot of

1110
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,579
what the state is so here using a lot of data including future data to predict

1111
01:08:10,579 --> 01:08:13,130
data including future data to predict the state of the given value time and

1112
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,679
the state of the given value time and suppose nothing obviously because this

1113
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:18,289
suppose nothing obviously because this would be very smooth to answer than what

1114
01:08:18,289 --> 01:08:20,959
would be very smooth to answer than what you would get with printer various

1115
01:08:20,959 --> 01:08:22,999
you would get with printer various problems you can address them with

1116
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:25,569
problems you can address them with probabilistic graphical models and

1117
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:27,829
probabilistic graphical models and actually we talked on deeper messages

1118
01:08:27,829 --> 01:08:30,769
actually we talked on deeper messages the way we did for for changed but I

1119
01:08:30,769 --> 01:08:35,209
the way we did for for changed but I will again do another King today to use

1120
01:08:35,209 --> 01:08:36,829
will again do another King today to use the junction tree over to show this

1121
01:08:36,829 --> 01:08:40,729
the junction tree over to show this problem okay just think you can get the

1122
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:51,049
problem okay just think you can get the Peconic if the junction tree thinking

1123
01:08:51,049 --> 01:08:53,180
Peconic if the junction tree thinking deeply so children for example to

1124
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,740
deeply so children for example to calculate the marginal of the

1125
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:57,200
calculate the marginal of the observations you can see the summation

1126
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,660
observations you can see the summation here this challenge because if you have

1127
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:02,419
here this challenge because if you have these steps and each day but you have to

1128
01:09:02,419 --> 01:09:04,879
these steps and each day but you have to some take some values this is M to the

1129
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:10,069
some take some values this is M to the time m to Capitol Hill calculations so

1130
01:09:10,069 --> 01:09:12,470
time m to Capitol Hill calculations so this is very expensive we need to be

1131
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:16,780
this is very expensive we need to be able to do this table for problems with

1132
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:26,160
able to do this table for problems with well better than this exponential course

1133
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:26,170


1134
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:31,590
I don't think I would be able to proceed um realizing it but let's try to do our

1135
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:36,240
um realizing it but let's try to do our best so if you reminders of some of the

1136
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,820
best so if you reminders of some of the things beginning we will come and

1137
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:42,390
things beginning we will come and discuss them slowly in front of lectures

1138
01:09:42,390 --> 01:10:07,080
discuss them slowly in front of lectures but I want to use okay if you see here

1139
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,570
but I want to use okay if you see here is the smoothing problem I am well aware

1140
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:12,560
is the smoothing problem I am well aware of the derivations because I don't have

1141
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,090
of the derivations because I don't have the time and since we will repeat this

1142
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:20,540
the time and since we will repeat this right let me just say that by using this

1143
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:28,470
right let me just say that by using this basic probability was a no-show

1144
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:32,370
basic probability was a no-show by using conditional independence

1145
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:33,840
by using conditional independence relationships applied by this graph

1146
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,440
relationships applied by this graph basically that which are given the node

1147
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:40,650
basically that which are given the node P P Q P plus 1 is independent of QT

1148
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:43,290
P P Q P plus 1 is independent of QT minus 1 right the type of Independence

1149
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:46,110
minus 1 right the type of Independence relations you can show that this moving

1150
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:48,990
relations you can show that this moving probability it's really the product of

1151
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:51,360
probability it's really the product of the non semesters which is absolute

1152
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:55,530
the non semesters which is absolute masters x 2 bar minus beta divided by P

1153
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:58,920
masters x 2 bar minus beta divided by P of Y the marginal of Y and the

1154
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,320
of Y the marginal of Y and the definition of the alpha methods is this

1155
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,960
definition of the alpha methods is this entity here and the definition of the

1156
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:07,770
entity here and the definition of the meta message just presented there if you

1157
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:09,180
meta message just presented there if you look at this definition that comes

1158
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:13,560
look at this definition that comes basically do the derivation is very

1159
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,750
basically do the derivation is very simple is that is the probability that

1160
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:20,130
simple is that is the probability that you will observe y0 y1 y3 and then in

1161
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:24,000
you will observe y0 y1 y3 and then in the end of stage GT all right

1162
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,670
the end of stage GT all right so alpha is merely something that

1163
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:28,530
so alpha is merely something that accounts for all your observations of

1164
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:31,080
accounts for all your observations of deterring TV sort of forward calculation

1165
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,240
deterring TV sort of forward calculation but the trace is the joint probability

1166
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,090
but the trace is the joint probability of

1167
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:37,990
the observed date of to little T assuming that you've finished in state

1168
01:11:37,990 --> 01:12:23,770
assuming that you've finished in state 50 and you can show the first message is

1169
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:25,800
50 and you can show the first message is that you have to calculate this

1170
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,540
that you have to calculate this probability and this really can be

1171
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:30,310
probability and this really can be calculated recursively we have been

1172
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:31,510
calculated recursively we have been encouraged to the questions for the

1173
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:33,910
encouraged to the questions for the Alpha method and the recursive equation

1174
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:37,000
Alpha method and the recursive equation for the beta message noticed that the

1175
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,310
for the beta message noticed that the updating of the Alpha message is

1176
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:41,680
updating of the Alpha message is affirmative date so we reverse the

1177
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:47,200
affirmative date so we reverse the message alpha Q T and the observation

1178
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,810
message alpha Q T and the observation model of the dynamics to update so there

1179
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:51,430
model of the dynamics to update so there is a marginalization if you take here

1180
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:53,620
is a marginalization if you take here and the bigger message is the bathroom

1181
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:55,390
and the bigger message is the bathroom message because you need to know the

1182
01:12:55,390 --> 01:13:00,280
message because you need to know the bigger masses of 350 plus one we've seen

1183
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:08,870
bigger masses of 350 plus one we've seen this batch away yes when we change okay

1184
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:16,470
this batch away yes when we change okay [Applause]

1185
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:16,480


1186
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:23,410
it's really that's what we did before but now we have this observation system

1187
01:13:23,410 --> 01:13:26,260
but now we have this observation system but literally this is the update

1188
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:28,660
but literally this is the update equation this is a equation for the

1189
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:33,470
equation this is a equation for the market

1190
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:33,480


1191
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:41,750
in mrs. Ballew constant and it is you know you're not still be remaining which

1192
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:45,620
know you're not still be remaining which part are you expensive actually the the

1193
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:46,880
part are you expensive actually the the automation of the death with the

1194
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,070
automation of the death with the junction tree if you missed a map of

1195
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:50,900
junction tree if you missed a map of propagation related to not to the

1196
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,150
propagation related to not to the message beta but to this message gamma

1197
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:55,160
message beta but to this message gamma and this message garlic you know what

1198
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:58,280
and this message garlic you know what the pH is the posterior of QT given long

1199
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,979
the pH is the posterior of QT given long terms of relations from y 0 to Y

1200
01:14:00,979 --> 01:14:04,670
terms of relations from y 0 to Y tropical T so this map of messed again

1201
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:07,400
tropical T so this map of messed again is the posterior of should be given all

1202
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,350
is the posterior of should be given all the observations of the capital T and

1203
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:12,170
the observations of the capital T and you may say wife tomorrow message

1204
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:14,360
you may say wife tomorrow message because if you do the calculations and

1205
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:17,840
because if you do the calculations and they are simple to reveal the only gives

1206
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,970
they are simple to reveal the only gives mister collation of the so to account

1207
01:14:19,970 --> 01:14:21,920
mister collation of the so to account for some conditional independence you

1208
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,770
for some conditional independence you can show that the gamma Q T to complete

1209
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:26,180
can show that the gamma Q T to complete each you have to compute the Masters

1210
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:28,729
each you have to compute the Masters gamma 3 T plus 1 and then months analyze

1211
01:14:28,729 --> 01:14:31,310
gamma 3 T plus 1 and then months analyze with respect to K T plus one semester

1212
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:34,220
with respect to K T plus one semester and I want you to right now to worry

1213
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:38,240
and I want you to right now to worry about the details of the questions for

1214
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,970
about the details of the questions for basically there is a data mess is

1215
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:43,820
basically there is a data mess is propagating backwards but also is a

1216
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:44,660
propagating backwards but also is a reminiscence

1217
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:47,390
reminiscence if you like what's a little different ok

1218
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:50,870
if you like what's a little different ok they have different definitions okay and

1219
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:53,450
they have different definitions okay and their days if you know the sulfur masses

1220
01:14:53,450 --> 01:14:55,939
their days if you know the sulfur masses and the beta masters program a message

1221
01:14:55,939 --> 01:15:00,140
and the beta masters program a message effectively you can calculate there is

1222
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:02,060
effectively you can calculate there is nothing probability distribution of QT

1223
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:04,220
nothing probability distribution of QT given all the data so if you never

1224
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:06,130
given all the data so if you never observe esters you say give me a nice

1225
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:08,750
observe esters you say give me a nice smooth prediction of the state to take

1226
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:11,030
smooth prediction of the state to take its effectively multiplying at least

1227
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:12,860
its effectively multiplying at least knowledge the further than the marketing

1228
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:14,300
knowledge the further than the marketing message the same way with an unequal

1229
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:17,810
message the same way with an unequal training remember for the chain we need

1230
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:21,620
training remember for the chain we need to calculate the posterior several types

1231
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,240
to calculate the posterior several types of common measures the market message

1232
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:29,270
of common measures the market message this is it do anything except to tell

1233
01:15:29,270 --> 01:16:10,010
this is it do anything except to tell you

1234
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:10,020


1235
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:17,729
this and the other and we will see the formulas we get to the junction 3 they

1236
01:16:17,729 --> 01:16:19,979
formulas we get to the junction 3 they are basically identical to the out

1237
01:16:19,979 --> 01:16:23,609
are basically identical to the out program updates that you get with the

1238
01:16:23,609 --> 01:16:26,959
program updates that you get with the classical length we put using

1239
01:16:26,959 --> 01:16:46,890
classical length we put using conditional okay the next homework

1240
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:49,260
conditional okay the next homework project so make it a comma because

1241
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:51,180
project so make it a comma because that's why you can learn something about

1242
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:55,440
that's why you can learn something about data assimilation alright so so perfect
