00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:39,660
为什么所以我们离开了上一堂课，所以这是针对那些基于
why so we left the previous lecture so this is for those that was based on

2
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:39,670
为什么所以我们离开了上一堂课，所以这是针对那些基于
this is for those that was based on lying this is the earlier lecture on

introduction to approximate Bayesian inference what's right was the other one

6
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,780
推断正确的是我让您忘记的另一个，好吧，我们找到了它
introduction to approximate Bayesian inference what's right was the other one

7
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:56,730
推断正确的是我让您忘记的另一个，好吧，我们找到了它
inference what's right was the other one I had you forgot okay we locate it so

8
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:56,740
推断正确的是我让您忘记的另一个，好吧，我们找到了它
I had you forgot okay we locate it so we're going to continue on that every

9
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,070
我们将继续在每个讲座中都有这个结冰的例子
I had you forgot okay we locate it so we're going to continue on that every

10
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,980
我们将继续在每个讲座中都有这个结冰的例子
we're going to continue on that every lecture there was this icing example

11
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:01,990
我们将继续在每个讲座中都有这个结冰的例子
lecture there was this icing example that I went rapidly so let's review it

12
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,990
我走得很快，所以让我们回顾一下，因为这对于很多人来说非常重要
lecture there was this icing example that I went rapidly so let's review it

13
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,690
我走得很快，所以让我们回顾一下，因为这对于很多人来说非常重要
that I went rapidly so let's review it because it's very fundamental to lots of

14
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:09,700
我走得很快，所以让我们回顾一下，因为这对于很多人来说非常重要
because it's very fundamental to lots of areas all right so obviously you have

15
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:16,290
没事的地方，所以很明显，您已经在家庭作业中列出了清单
because it's very fundamental to lots of areas all right so obviously you have

16
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,890
没事的地方，所以很明显，您已经在家庭作业中列出了清单
areas all right so obviously you have worked on lists in the homework we

17
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:18,900
没事的地方，所以很明显，您已经在家庭作业中列出了清单
worked on lists in the homework we assume here we have some observations

18
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,760
假设在这里我们有一些观察为什么，但是被定义为以像素为单位

20
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,190
假设在这里我们有一些观察为什么，但是被定义为以像素为单位
why but are defined let's say pixel wise and X maybe the tradition image this is

21
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,890
X可能是传统图像，这是该图像的某些嘈杂版本，
why but are defined let's say pixel wise and X maybe the tradition image this is

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,510
X可能是传统图像，这是该图像的某些嘈杂版本，
and X maybe the tradition image this is some noisy version of the image and

23
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:30,520
X可能是传统图像，这是该图像的某些嘈杂版本，
some noisy version of the image and these are the original pictures we try

24
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,640
这些是我们尝试估计的原始图片，所以这里没有看到
some noisy version of the image and these are the original pictures we try

25
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,780
这些是我们尝试估计的原始图片，所以这里没有看到
these are the original pictures we try to estimate so there is no see here so

26
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:36,790
这些是我们尝试估计的原始图片，所以这里没有看到
to estimate so there is no see here so you can think the unknowns basically are

27
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,610
您可以认为未知数基本上是X，这就是我们想要做的
to estimate so there is no see here so you can think the unknowns basically are

您可以认为未知数基本上是X，这就是我们想要做的
you can think the unknowns basically are X this is what we want to do an

29
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:40,660
您可以认为未知数基本上是X，这就是我们想要做的
X this is what we want to do an inference and so we've worked with the

30
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:47,360
推论，所以我们使用了一些关节和后部
X this is what we want to do an inference and so we've worked with the

31
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,310
推论，所以我们使用了一些关节和后部
inference and so we've worked with the joint and the posterior with with some

32
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:50,320
推论，所以我们使用了一些关节和后部
joint and the posterior with with some prior the prior is basically standard

33
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,340
事前事前基本上是这类付款的标准是礼物
joint and the posterior with with some prior the prior is basically standard

34
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,460
事前事前基本上是这类付款的标准是礼物
prior the prior is basically standard for this type of payments is is gift

35
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:56,470
事前事前基本上是这类付款的标准是礼物
for this type of payments is is gift like distribution e to the minus e0 some

36
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,900
例如将e分配到e0，则某些能量函数占
for this type of payments is is gift like distribution e to the minus e0 some

37
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,740
例如将e分配到e0，则某些能量函数占

38
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:03,750
例如将e分配到e0，则某些能量函数占
energy functional that accounts for nearest neighbors basically interactions

39
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,360
最近的邻居基本上是互动的，好吧，这是非常典型的
energy functional that accounts for nearest neighbors basically interactions

40
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,610
最近的邻居基本上是互动的，好吧，这是非常典型的
nearest neighbors basically interactions okay this is sort of very typical of

41
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:08,620
最近的邻居基本上是互动的，好吧，这是非常典型的
okay this is sort of very typical of massaging models these are some

42
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,700
按摩模型这些是这里给出的一些系数兴奋的一天
okay this is sort of very typical of massaging models these are some

43
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,710
按摩模型这些是这里给出的一些系数兴奋的一天
massaging models these are some coefficients given here excited day

44
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:15,720
按摩模型这些是这里给出的一些系数兴奋的一天
coefficients given here excited day they're binary variables plus minus one

45
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,190
它们是二进制变量再加上一减就可以了，所以我们喜欢这种可能性
coefficients given here excited day they're binary variables plus minus one

46
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:25,260
它们是二进制变量再加上一减就可以了，所以我们喜欢这种可能性
they're binary variables plus minus one okay all right so we like the likelihood

47
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,270
它们是二进制变量再加上一减就可以了，所以我们喜欢这种可能性
okay all right so we like the likelihood locally is the product for all eyes on

48
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,990
在我为什么给定X的Y概率的情况下，本地产品是所有人的眼睛
okay all right so we like the likelihood locally is the product for all eyes on

49
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,140
在我为什么给定X的Y概率的情况下，本地产品是所有人的眼睛

50
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,150
在我为什么给定X的Y概率的情况下，本地产品是所有人的眼睛
why I given the probability of Y given X I and we write this probability so we

51
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,840
我和我们写下这个概率，这样我们就可以
why I given the probability of Y given X I and we write this probability so we

52
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,680
我和我们写下这个概率，这样我们就可以
I and we write this probability so we can

53
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:34,690
我和我们写下这个概率，这样我们就可以
can make the algebra to look nice has to get

54
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,410
要使代数看起来更好，就必须撒谎，所以总的来说
can make the algebra to look nice has to get

55
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,470
要使代数看起来更好，就必须撒谎，所以总的来说
make the algebra to look nice has to get to the power a lie so the total

56
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:40,480
要使代数看起来更好，就必须撒谎，所以总的来说
to the power a lie so the total likelihood basically is the exponential

57
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,300
可能性基本上是该能量单元I的总和的指数
to the power a lie so the total likelihood basically is the exponential

58
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,880
可能性基本上是该能量单元I的总和的指数
likelihood basically is the exponential of the summation of this energy cell I

59
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:44,890
可能性基本上是该能量单元I的总和的指数
of the summation of this energy cell I of X I okay so that way we can write the

60
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,270
XI好的，这样我们就可以写出后验，就像在某些人的脑海中一样
of the summation of this energy cell I of X I okay so that way we can write the

61
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,230
XI好的，这样我们就可以写出后验，就像在某些人的脑海中一样
of X I okay so that way we can write the posterior as if to the mind of some

62
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
XI好的，这样我们就可以写出后验，就像在某些人的脑海中一样

65
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:57,910
为这些小矿工提供能量的地方证据的目的地
miners destination of the local evidence which okay so what we want is we want to

66
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:03,720
好的，所以我们想要计算一个近似值
miners destination of the local evidence which okay so what we want is we want to

67
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,360
好的，所以我们想要计算一个近似值
which okay so what we want is we want to compute an approximation to this

68
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:06,370
好的，所以我们想要计算一个近似值
compute an approximation to this posterior all right that's our objective

69
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,790
后路好吧，这是我们的目标，我想你可以转弯，这很容易
compute an approximation to this posterior all right that's our objective

70
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,540
后路好吧，这是我们的目标，我想你可以转弯，这很容易
posterior all right that's our objective I mean you can this turn is an easy

71
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:12,550
后路好吧，这是我们的目标，我想你可以转弯，这很容易
I mean you can this turn is an easy problem you can directly work with it so

72
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,610
问题，您可以直接使用它，所以您真的不需要近似值

74
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,030
问题，您可以直接使用它，所以您真的不需要近似值
you don't really need an approximation this chain is a going distribution but

75
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,810
这个链条是一个持续的分布，但是我们说很好，您知道我们想
you don't really need an approximation this chain is a going distribution but

76
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,270
这个链条是一个持续的分布，但是我们说很好，您知道我们想
this chain is a going distribution but we say well you know we want to

77
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
这个链条是一个持续的分布，但是我们说很好，您知道我们想
we say well you know we want to factorize QX in a nice form that is

78
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,720
以一种很好的形式分解QX，可以很好地分解我，所以对于每个i

factorizable i alright so for each i we're going to have the corresponding Q

81
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,170
我们将有相应的XI Q I，因为XI是正负2
factorizable i alright so for each i we're going to have the corresponding Q

我们将有相应的XI Q I，因为XI是正负2
I of X I and because X I is plus minus 2 R is discrete the only thing we need to

84
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,340
R是离散的，我们唯一需要用分布描述它的是

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:27,460
我们对什么分配的大部分期望都寄予厚望


124
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,530
我们对什么分配的大部分期望都寄予厚望
most of what distribution we have the expectation of the love of what

125
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:31,540
我们对什么分配的大部分期望都寄予厚望
expectation of the love of what distribution before one with the other

126
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:37,890
一般而言，我们先观察到X和
expectation of the love of what distribution before one with the other

127
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,790
一般而言，我们先观察到X和
distribution before one with the other in general right we had observable X and

128
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:41,800
一般而言，我们先观察到X和
in general right we had observable X and we had less enviable Z so what

129
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,760
我们的Z不那么令人羡慕，所以右边的分布是什么
in general right we had observable X and we had less enviable Z so what

130
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,600
我们的Z不那么令人羡慕，所以右边的分布是什么
we had less enviable Z so what distribution the right-hand side what

131
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:48,610
我们的Z不那么令人羡慕，所以右边的分布是什么
distribution the right-hand side what the question was referring to the joint

132
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,620
问题是指联合是一种可能性权利，即
distribution the right-hand side what the question was referring to the joint

133
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,010
问题是指联合是一种可能性权利，即
the question was referring to the joint was a likelihood right that was the

134
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,020
问题是指联合是一种可能性权利，即
was a likelihood right that was the starting point so the joint of like

135
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,290
起点，所以像把它留在这里的关节尤其可能错过了
was a likelihood right that was the starting point so the joint of like

136
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,470
起点，所以像把它留在这里的关节尤其可能错过了
starting point so the joint of like leave it here especially could've missed

137
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:00,480
起点，所以像把它留在这里的关节尤其可能错过了
leave it here especially could've missed all right so we started the of

138
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,330
好吧，所以我们开始这个因素的bit子真的是什么都没有
leave it here especially could've missed all right so we started the of

139
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,210
好吧，所以我们开始这个因素的bit子真的是什么都没有
all right so we started the of this factor really is nothing at the

140
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:06,220
好吧，所以我们开始这个因素的bit子真的是什么都没有
this factor really is nothing at the language of these factors is the

141
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,280
这些因素的语言是期望值还是请登录
this factor really is nothing at the language of these factors is the

142
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,470
这些因素的语言是期望值还是请登录
language of these factors is the expectation or please doing log

143
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:10,480
这些因素的语言是期望值还是请登录
expectation or please doing log likelihood which is basically minus this

144
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
基本上是减去这种能量的可能性，这就是我们
expectation or please doing log likelihood which is basically minus this

145
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,930
基本上是减去这种能量的可能性，这就是我们
likelihood which is basically minus this energy you take the logs this is we're

146
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:15,940
基本上是减去这种能量的可能性，这就是我们
energy you take the logs this is we're talking about the UH normalized thing

147
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,310
谈论UH归一化的东西很清楚，所以减去了能量影响
energy you take the logs this is we're talking about the UH normalized thing

148
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,660
谈论UH归一化的东西很清楚，所以减去了能量影响
talking about the UH normalized thing clear so it's minus the energy effects

149
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:20,670
谈论UH归一化的东西很清楚，所以减去了能量影响
clear so it's minus the energy effects so so the number of the joint of

150
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,810
因此，似然的关节数显然更容易，因为这
clear so it's minus the energy effects so so the number of the joint of

151
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,200
因此，似然的关节数显然更容易，因为这
so so the number of the joint of likelihood is obviously easier as this

152
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,210
因此，似然的关节数显然更容易，因为这
likelihood is obviously easier as this right so with the - time it will be

153
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,580
对，所以-时间将是外部时间乘以所有时间的总和
likelihood is obviously easier as this right so with the - time it will be

154
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,650
对，所以-时间将是外部时间乘以所有时间的总和
right so with the - time it will be external times the summation of all the

155
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:34,660
对，所以-时间将是外部时间乘以所有时间的总和
external times the summation of all the neighbors of I plus ally of X I and I is

156
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:39,540
我和XI的同盟的邻居，我有很多问题，我认为这是

158
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:42,360
我和XI的同盟的邻居，我有很多问题，我认为这是
many many problems and I think this reflects I to be a problem because I'm

妈妈对不起，所以当对所有人的这种痛苦期待时
expectation of this with respect to all other body most

185
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,790
其他的身体，你最不想去扎达克领带
expectation of this with respect to all other body most

186
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,140
其他的身体，你最不想去扎达克领带
other body most you're not going to datsuk tie right

187
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,150
其他的身体，你最不想去扎达克领带
you're not going to datsuk tie right because it's a lot of re most part istic

188
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,750
因为在大多数情况下，您一直是他们的替代者
you're not going to datsuk tie right because it's a lot of re most part istic

189
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,760
因为在大多数情况下，您一直是他们的替代者
because it's a lot of re most part istic days you have been a substitute them

190
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:00,770
因为在大多数情况下，您一直是他们的替代者
days you have been a substitute them with what my definition with there are

191
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:06,970
我的定义有很多值，因为它们的表达式
days you have been a substitute them with what my definition with there are

192
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,770
我的定义有很多值，因为它们的表达式
with what my definition with there are many values because their expressions

193
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:08,780
我的定义有很多值，因为它们的表达式
many values because their expressions are what is the mean values of XJ is

194
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,590
XJ的平均值在J附近是什么，所以我们说
many values because their expressions are what is the mean values of XJ is

195
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:19,630
XJ的平均值在J附近是什么，所以我们说
are what is the mean values of XJ is near J alright so we said that the

196
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:19,640
XJ的平均值在J附近是什么，所以我们说
near J alright so we said that the longer Qi was equal to that sir Qi is

197
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,760
齐等于先生齐是下一个高倍的指数
near J alright so we said that the longer Qi was equal to that sir Qi is

198
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,430
齐等于先生齐是下一个高倍的指数
longer Qi was equal to that sir Qi is the exponential of next high times

199
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:24,440
齐等于先生齐是下一个高倍的指数
the exponential of next high times destination over the neighbors of I plus

200
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,390
我的邻居的目的地加上当地的证据将取决于您
the exponential of next high times destination over the neighbors of I plus

201
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,940
我的邻居的目的地加上当地的证据将取决于您
destination over the neighbors of I plus the local evidence will depend on your

202
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:30,950
我的邻居的目的地加上当地的证据将取决于您
the local evidence will depend on your exile alright because X I can only take

203
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:37,060
放逐是可以的，因为XI只能取值加一减一
the local evidence will depend on your exile alright because X I can only take

204
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,950
放逐是可以的，因为XI只能取值加一减一
exile alright because X I can only take values plus one and minus one there so

205
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:41,960
放逐是可以的，因为XI只能取值加一减一
values plus one and minus one there so I'm introducing two different

206
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,590
我在这里介绍两个不同的定义。
values plus one and minus one there so I'm introducing two different

207
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,980
我在这里介绍两个不同的定义。
I'm introducing two different definitions here Li plus is the value

208
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:47,990
我在这里介绍两个不同的定义。
definitions here Li plus is the value for life when X is equal to one Li minus

209
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,160
X等于一Li时的生命减去呼气等于
definitions here Li plus is the value for life when X is equal to one Li minus

210
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,440
X等于一Li时的生命减去呼气等于
for life when X is equal to one Li minus the value of a life when exhale equal to

211
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:53,450
X等于一Li时的生命减去呼气等于
the value of a life when exhale equal to minus one and the reason I do this is

212
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,990
减一，我这样做的原因是因为X是离散的
the value of a life when exhale equal to minus one and the reason I do this is

213
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,960
减一，我这样做的原因是因为X是离散的
minus one and the reason I do this is because since X is the discrete

214
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:58,970
减一，我这样做的原因是因为X是离散的
because since X is the discrete distribution I am going to calculate the

215
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,050
分布我要计算X等于时的变分近似Qi
because since X is the discrete distribution I am going to calculate the

216
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,430
分布我要计算X等于时的变分近似Qi
distribution I am going to calculate the variational approximation Qi at X equal

217
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:06,440
分布我要计算X等于时的变分近似Qi
variational approximation Qi at X equal to one so with this formula William this

218
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,390
一个这样的公式威廉这个呃归一化的分配权是
variational approximation Qi at X equal to one so with this formula William this

219
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,190
一个这样的公式威廉这个呃归一化的分配权是
to one so with this formula William this uh normalized distribution right that's

220
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:12,200
一个这样的公式威廉这个呃归一化的分配权是
uh normalized distribution right that's why you have this symbol here do you

221
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,140
为什么在这里有此符号，您是否相信-例如-1是
uh normalized distribution right that's why you have this symbol here do you

222
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,750
为什么在这里有此符号，您是否相信-例如-1是
why you have this symbol here do you believe that - I for example - 1 is

223
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:16,760
为什么在这里有此符号，您是否相信-例如-1是
believe that - I for example - 1 is equal to really let's call this whole

224
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,920
等于真的让我们在这里称这整个总和为好，所以这
believe that - I for example - 1 is equal to really let's call this whole

225
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,030
等于真的让我们在这里称这整个总和为好，所以这
equal to really let's call this whole summation here mi alright so this

226
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
等于真的让我们在这里称这整个总和为好，所以这
summation here mi alright so this conservation work all is mi so we agreed

227
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,150
保护工作都是mi，所以我们同意qi 4 x等于1就是1
summation here mi alright so this conservation work all is mi so we agreed

228
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:33,670
保护工作都是mi，所以我们同意qi 4 x等于1就是1
conservation work all is mi so we agreed that qi 4 x equals 1 is this would be 1

229
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
保护工作都是mi，所以我们同意qi 4 x等于1就是1
that qi 4 x equals 1 is this would be 1 so you need to the mi + x I equal 1 plus

230
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,330
因此您需要将mi + x I等于1加li加除以该归一化
that qi 4 x equals 1 is this would be 1 so you need to the mi + x I equal 1 plus

231
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,670
因此您需要将mi + x I等于1加li加除以该归一化
so you need to the mi + x I equal 1 plus li plus divided by this normalization

232
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:42,680
因此您需要将mi + x I等于1加li加除以该归一化
li plus divided by this normalization factor

233
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,400
因素
li plus divided by this normalization factor

234
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,100
好吧，如果我写这个，我可以这样做
li plus divided by this normalization factor

235
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,110
好吧，如果我写这个，我可以这样做


236
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:52,670
好吧，如果我写这个，我可以这样做
right okay if I write this I can do it like this

237
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:52,680
好吧，如果我写这个，我可以这样做
if I write this I can do it like this and immediately you see that this

238
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,680
然后您立即发现这种流量周期将被采用
if I write this I can do it like this and immediately you see that this

239
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,590
然后您立即发现这种流量周期将被采用
and immediately you see that this traffic cycles one comes to be employed

240
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
然后您立即发现这种流量周期将被采用
traffic cycles one comes to be employed okay so that's a very nice result

241
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,280
好吧，这是一个非常不错的结果，好吧，同样，七月的身体
traffic cycles one comes to be employed okay so that's a very nice result

242
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:07,880
好吧，这是一个非常不错的结果，好吧，同样，七月的身体
okay so that's a very nice result okay and and similarly the body of july

243
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:07,890
好吧，这是一个非常不错的结果，好吧，同样，七月的身体
okay and and similarly the body of july 4 ik cycle -1 comes to be this 2.4

244
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,360
4 ik周期-1成为这个2.4参数--AI的AI很好
okay and and similarly the body of july 4 ik cycle -1 comes to be this 2.4

245
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,770
4 ik周期-1成为这个2.4参数--AI的AI很好
4 ik cycle -1 comes to be this 2.4 argument - - AI for AI is this nice

anything that does not depend on you we don't play with okay so the prior and

478
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:00,090
不要玩，所以先验和tau是常数，所以如果您扩展
anything that does not depend on you we don't play with okay so the prior and

有人可以说这件事是否有下降测验这个学期目标很重要
time we get if we expand let you come can somebody tell it's important if this

488
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:26,309
有人可以说这件事是否有下降测验这个学期目标很重要
can somebody tell it's important if this thing have drop quiz this term target

489
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:30,450
所以这来自那里可能的可能性
can somebody tell it's important if this thing have drop quiz this term target

490
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:30,460
所以这来自那里可能的可能性


491
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:36,139
所以这来自那里可能的可能性
so this came from the the likelihood there all right

492
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:36,149
所以这来自那里可能的可能性
there all right okay and the query is to this time

493
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:39,629
好的，查询到现在为止是从您开始计算的。
there all right okay and the query is to this time

494
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:47,940
好的，查询到现在为止是从您开始计算的。
okay and the query is to this time counting from you given top okay which

495
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:47,950
好的，查询到现在为止是从您开始计算的。
counting from you given top okay which is Gaussian okay so and you remember the

496
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,680
是高斯的，所以，您还记得那是lambda 0倍的精度
counting from you given top okay which is Gaussian okay so and you remember the

497
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,159
是高斯的，所以，您还记得那是lambda 0倍的精度
is Gaussian okay so and you remember the precision of that it was lambda 0 times

498
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:56,169
是高斯的，所以，您还记得那是lambda 0倍的精度
precision of that it was lambda 0 times tau so obviously you're gonna get 1 2 0

499
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:58,919
tau很明显，你会得到1 2 0倍的tau，但是Tau变成了期望
precision of that it was lambda 0 times tau so obviously you're gonna get 1 2 0

500
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,249
tau很明显，你会得到1 2 0倍的tau，但是Tau变成了期望
tau so obviously you're gonna get 1 2 0 times tau but the Tau became expectation

501
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:02,259
tau很明显，你会得到1 2 0倍的tau，但是Tau变成了期望
times tau but the Tau became expectation of tau Y because every queries any time

502
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:05,970
的原因，因为每一次询问我们都需要期望就可以了
times tau but the Tau became expectation of tau Y because every queries any time

503
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:11,220
的原因，因为每一次询问我们都需要期望就可以了
of tau Y because every queries any time we need to take expectations okay

504
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,230
的原因，因为每一次询问我们都需要期望就可以了
we need to take expectations okay and again the rest terms that depend

505
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,379
其余仅依赖于不依赖于视图的术语
we need to take expectations okay and again the rest terms that depend

506
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:17,879
其余仅依赖于不依赖于视图的术语
and again the rest terms that depend only on on the don't depend on view we

507
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:17,889
其余仅依赖于不依赖于视图的术语
only on on the don't depend on view we don't include them okay so you look at

508
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:19,950
不要把它们包括在内，所以无论您使用哪种发行版，您都可以看到它
only on on the don't depend on view we don't include them okay so you look at

509
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,409
不要把它们包括在内，所以无论您使用哪种发行版，您都可以看到它
don't include them okay so you look at this nice whatever distribution do you

510
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:22,419
不要把它们包括在内，所以无论您使用哪种发行版，您都可以看到它
this nice whatever distribution do you think you will get here if you play for

511
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:25,680
我想如果你以此计算玩了五分钟你会到达这里
this nice whatever distribution do you think you will get here if you play for

512
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,690
我想如果你以此计算玩了五分钟你会到达这里
think you will get here if you play for five minutes with this calculation I

513
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:29,700
我想如果你以此计算玩了五分钟你会到达这里
five minutes with this calculation I mean we need a distribution of you know

514
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,070
意味着我们需要您知道的分布，并且我向您发送一个新的正方形和一个正方形
five minutes with this calculation I mean we need a distribution of you know

00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,669
意味着我们需要您知道的分布，并且我向您发送一个新的正方形和一个正方形
mean we need a distribution of you know and I stream u square a new square and a

516
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
意味着我们需要您知道的分布，并且我向您发送一个新的正方形和一个正方形
and I stream u square a new square and a linear term in una Linea Turing new plus

517
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,680
una中的线性项Linea Turing新加常数，因此显然会闭合平方
and I stream u square a new square and a linear term in una Linea Turing new plus

518
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,350

519
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:40,360
una中的线性项Linea Turing新加常数，因此显然会闭合平方
constant so obviously closing the square we're gonna get a Gaussian distribution

520
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,330
我们将获得这种花园传统的高斯分布
constant so obviously closing the square we're gonna get a Gaussian distribution

521
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,680
我们将获得这种花园传统的高斯分布
we're gonna get a Gaussian distribution of this garden tradition you can so with

522
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:45,690
我们将获得这种花园传统的高斯分布
of this garden tradition you can so with zero time has this mean and has this

523
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,139
零时间具有该均值，并且具有这种精度，所以X是样本
of this garden tradition you can so with zero time has this mean and has this

524
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:55,230
零时间具有该均值，并且具有这种精度，所以X是样本
zero time has this mean and has this precision okay and so X is the sample

525
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:55,240
零时间具有该均值，并且具有这种精度，所以X是样本
precision okay and so X is the sample mean basically this is for the data come

526
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,539
基本上意味着这是因为数据来自于先前的lambda n
precision okay and so X is the sample mean basically this is for the data come

527
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:02,690
基本上意味着这是因为数据来自于先前的lambda n
mean basically this is for the data come from this comes from the prior lambda n

528
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:02,700
基本上意味着这是因为数据来自于先前的lambda n
from this comes from the prior lambda n involves the precision of tau in

529
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,149
涉及到tau的精度立即提醒您，因为我们
from this comes from the prior lambda n involves the precision of tau in

530
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:08,519
涉及到tau的精度立即提醒您，因为我们
involves the precision of tau in immediately that reminds you because we

531
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:08,529
涉及到tau的精度立即提醒您，因为我们
immediately that reminds you because we don't know that the posterior but

532
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:10,289
不知道后路，但是我们需要做些什么
immediately that reminds you because we don't know that the posterior but

533
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,879
不知道后路，但是我们需要做些什么
don't know that the posterior but somehow we're gonna need to do

534
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:11,889
不知道后路，但是我们需要做些什么
somehow we're gonna need to do iterations so basically to compute this

535
00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:14,190
迭代，因此基本上要计算此分布，您需要知道
somehow we're gonna need to do iterations so basically to compute this

536
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,970
迭代，因此基本上要计算此分布，您需要知道
iterations so basically to compute this distribution you need to know what the

537
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:17,980
迭代，因此基本上要计算此分布，您需要知道
distribution you need to know what the mean of tau it's okay so we need to go

538
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,879
牛头意味着没有问题，所以我们需要计算一下
distribution you need to know what the mean of tau it's okay so we need to go

539
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:23,549
牛头意味着没有问题，所以我们需要计算一下
mean of tau it's okay so we need to go and compute off

540
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:23,980
所以同样离开了我们，我们对所有人都寄予了厚望
mean of tau it's okay so we need to go and compute off

541
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:23,990
所以同样离开了我们，我们对所有人都寄予了厚望


542
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:30,980
所以同样离开了我们，我们对所有人都寄予了厚望
so similarly left the power again we have big expectation with respect to all

543
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:30,990
所以同样离开了我们，我们对所有人都寄予了厚望
have big expectation with respect to all the other variables which dearest meal

544
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,570
其他变量，这些变量最珍惜事前的可能性
have big expectation with respect to all the other variables which dearest meal

tau的分布，所以这个术语来自数据的可能性，所以
comes from the data likelihood so obviously didn't be an ex-professional

553
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,840
显然不是一个专业人士，期待您来自此，所以
comes from the data likelihood so obviously didn't be an ex-professional

583
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,830
另一个人从那里来，所以可以吗，所以我们有
another person coming from there all right so for is it okay so we have

584
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:10,840
另一个人从那里来，所以可以吗，所以我们有
all right so for is it okay so we have this term Plus this term so effectively

585
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,650
这个学期加上这个学期，如此有效，如果你看的话，你需要做什么
all right so for is it okay so we have this term Plus this term so effectively

586
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,930
这个学期加上这个学期，如此有效，如果你看的话，你需要做什么
this term Plus this term so effectively what you need to do if you look at it

587
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:15,940
这个学期加上这个学期，如此有效，如果你看的话，你需要做什么
what you need to do if you look at it carefully it is the log of the gamma

588
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,990
仔细地，它是伽马分布的对数，所以在正常情况下
what you need to do if you look at it carefully it is the log of the gamma

589
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,570
仔细地，它是伽马分布的对数，所以在正常情况下

590
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:21,580
仔细地，它是伽马分布的对数，所以在正常情况下
distribution alright so in the normal distribution when you take logs you get

591
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,490
分配原木时，会得到大量的tau和粉末，因此您
distribution alright so in the normal distribution when you take logs you get

592
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,330
分配原木时，会得到大量的tau和粉末，因此您
distribution when you take logs you get a lot of tau and a powder so that you

593
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:27,340
分配原木时，会得到大量的tau和粉末，因此您

all the power terms together alright what you will get is you will get a

597
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,210
您会得到的是，您将获得这种类型的伽玛分布
all the power terms together alright what you will get is you will get a

598
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,980
您会得到的是，您将获得这种类型的伽玛分布
what you will get is you will get a gamma distribution for this type of

599
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:37,990
您会得到的是，您将获得这种类型的伽玛分布
gamma distribution for this type of alpha 0 you have our fire and instead of

600
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,620
alpha 0，您拥有我们的火力，而不是bazzill，您拥有beta N，再次在这里

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,130
alpha 0，您拥有我们的火力，而不是bazzill，您拥有beta N，再次在这里
bazzill you have beta N and again here you need to have expectation with

603
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,530
您需要对MU有所期望，而无需全力以赴
bazzill you have beta N and again here you need to have expectation with

604
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:51,060
您需要对MU有所期望，而无需全力以赴
you need to have expectation with respect to MU and don't need to do all

605
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,070
您需要对MU有所期望，而无需全力以赴
respect to MU and don't need to do all of this so basically this distribution

606
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,520
因此，基本上所有qfm的分布汇总都是高斯分布
respect to MU and don't need to do all of this so basically this distribution

他们在这里您可以看到定义您需要知道的Q Prem的均值
parameters are defined the way you see them here you can see to define the mean

613
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,680
他们在这里您可以看到定义您需要知道的Q Prem的均值
them here you can see to define the mean the variance of Q Prem you need to know

614
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:10,690
他们在这里您可以看到定义您需要知道的Q Prem的均值
the variance of Q Prem you need to know the mean of tau in the ministry remember

615
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:16,800
内务部tau的均值记住正态分布，该均值
the variance of Q Prem you need to know the mean of tau in the ministry remember

00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,460
内务部tau的均值记住正态分布，该均值
the mean of tau in the ministry remember for a normal distribution which the mean

617
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:19,470
内务部tau的均值记住正态分布，该均值
for a normal distribution which the mean if you have gamma distribution of the

618
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,350
如果您的止损点有伽玛分布，则beta代表任何人
for a normal distribution which the mean if you have gamma distribution of the

619
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,450
如果您的止损点有伽玛分布，则beta代表任何人
if you have gamma distribution of the stop and beta would the mean anybody

620
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:24,460
如果您的止损点有伽玛分布，则beta代表任何人
stop and beta would the mean anybody remembers alpha divided by beta all

621
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,870
记得可以用alpha除以beta，所以您可以立即看到
stop and beta would the mean anybody remembers alpha divided by beta all

622
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,940
记得可以用alpha除以beta，所以您可以立即看到
remembers alpha divided by beta all right so you can see immediately that

623
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:29,950
记得可以用alpha除以beta，所以您可以立即看到
right so you can see immediately that the mean of tau depends on Alpha and

624
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:33,240
tau的平均值取决于Alpha和Beta n，后者又取决于
right so you can see immediately that the mean of tau depends on Alpha and

625
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:39,440
tau的平均值取决于Alpha和Beta n，后者又取决于
the mean of tau depends on Alpha and Beta n which again depends on moments of

626
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:39,450
tau的平均值取决于Alpha和Beta n，后者又取决于
Beta n which again depends on moments of alright so we need to know the

627
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,730
好吧，所以我们需要知道您的分布，所以您需要
Beta n which again depends on moments of alright so we need to know the

628
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,860
好吧，所以我们需要知道您的分布，所以您需要
alright so we need to know the distribution of you so what you need to

629
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:43,870
好吧，所以我们需要知道您的分布，所以您需要
distribution of you so what you need to do is you need to iterate ok it's like

630
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,040
要做的是，您需要进行迭代，好吧，就像您从某人的背心开始，然后
distribution of you so what you need to do is you need to iterate ok it's like

631
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,430
要做的是，您需要进行迭代，好吧，就像您从某人的背心开始，然后
do is you need to iterate ok it's like you start with somebody's vest then you

632
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:50,440
要做的是，您需要进行迭代，好吧，就像您从某人的背心开始，然后
you start with somebody's vest then you compute gamma then you find the moments

633
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,360
计算伽玛值，然后您便会发现当下所知道的瞬间

这样做是不是科学的魔术，您需要持续显示下半身
it does then whatever interests is you do it's magic is not science you need to

715
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,590
这样做是不是科学的魔术，您需要持续显示下半身
do it's magic is not science you need to show that the lower body continuously

716
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:46,600
这样做是不是科学的魔术，您需要持续显示下半身
show that the lower body continuously increases okay so we need to compute the

717
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,220
可以增加，所以我们现在需要计算较低的值，这就是标准
show that the lower body continuously increases okay so we need to compute the

718
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,330
可以增加，所以我们现在需要计算较低的值，这就是标准
increases okay so we need to compute the lower now that's the standard

719
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:51,340
可以增加，所以我们现在需要计算较低的值，这就是标准
lower now that's the standard calculation you have to do in this

725
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:02,890
尝试为高斯的简单情况做一个下界，所以我要
case of the Gaussian so I'm going to remind you the calculation it's also bad

726
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,940
提醒您计算也很糟糕，但是它的标准功能是可以做到两次或

univariate gaussians so you should be able to to live with it okay so let's

783
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,800
能够忍受它，好吧，让我们来看一下如果您愿意的话
univariate gaussians so you should be able to to live with it okay so let's

00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,720
能够忍受它，好吧，让我们来看一下如果您愿意的话
able to to live with it okay so let's see let's pick up the easy terms if you

785
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:03,730
能够忍受它，好吧，让我们来看一下如果您愿意的话
see let's pick up the easy terms if you take one more fuel and what type of

786
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,630
女权主义者多喝一种燃料，以及自我分配的类型
see let's pick up the easy terms if you take one more fuel and what type of

女权主义者多喝一种燃料，以及自我分配的类型
take one more fuel and what type of distribution self you feminists

788
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,379
它变成了高斯子爵的，很明显是对的，所以当你有
take one more fuel and what type of distribution self you feminists

789
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:13,389
它变成了高斯子爵的，很明显是对的，所以当你有


790
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:17,730
它变成了高斯子爵的，很明显是对的，所以当你有
it came to be a Gaussian viscount's and clear right so when you have the

791
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:17,740
它变成了高斯子爵的，很明显是对的，所以当你有
clear right so when you have the expected obviously there is not here

794
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:23,019
预期显然这里没有，所以期望与
alright so the expectation was with respect to me on power but this now

795
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:24,600
尊重我的权力，但这现在成为期望您的期望
alright so the expectation was with respect to me on power but this now

796
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,940

797
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:26,950
尊重我的权力，但这现在成为期望您的期望
becomes expectation expecting you so leave me what you have here is nothing

798
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,580
离开我，你在这里拥有的就是这个高斯的熵
becomes expectation expecting you so leave me what you have here is nothing

803
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:38,289
分布，所以您可以查看Wikipedia并说熵列表
Wikipedia and say entropy list there's the answer okay alright so this is the

804
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:44,820
答案很好，所以这是QP的熵就是
Wikipedia and say entropy list there's the answer okay alright so this is the

805
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:52,710
答案很好，所以这是QP的熵就是
the answer okay alright so this is the entropy of QP would be the entropy of

806
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:52,720
答案很好，所以这是QP的熵就是
entropy of QP would be the entropy of the gamma distribution you can again

807
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,409
当我75分钟后，您可以再次查看Wikipedia的伽马分布
entropy of QP would be the entropy of the gamma distribution you can again

808
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:59,060
当我75分钟后，您可以再次查看Wikipedia的伽马分布
the gamma distribution you can again look at Wikipedia 75 minutes when I

809
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,070
当我75分钟后，您可以再次查看Wikipedia的伽马分布
look at Wikipedia 75 minutes when I check these things right there is

810
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,950
检查这些东西对您有无处不在的信息
look at Wikipedia 75 minutes when I check these things right there is

出现在伽玛分布中，它也出现在分布中，所以这
also appears in the distribution so this is it so this is the by gamma

819
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,269
就是这样，这是伽玛分布，好吧，我不会告诉你
also appears in the distribution so this is it so this is the by gamma

00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:04,980
我在这里，谢谢您记住噪声过滤，这是一个非线性过滤
I'm here thank you remember noise filtering and it's a nonlinear filtering

1212
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:04,990
我在这里，谢谢您记住噪声过滤，这是一个非线性过滤
filtering and it's a nonlinear filtering all right so what is that entity is -

1213
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:08,980
好吧，那个实体是什么-这个词
filtering and it's a nonlinear filtering all right so what is that entity is -

1214
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,260
好吧，那个实体是什么-这个词
all right so what is that entity is - the word

1215
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:16,620
现在看起来像是一个期望，但是对什么是更好的定义
all right so what is that entity is - the word

1216
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,630
现在看起来像是一个期望，但是对什么是更好的定义


1217
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:20,610
现在看起来像是一个期望，但是对什么是更好的定义
now it looks like an expectation but there is a better definition of what is

1218
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:20,620
现在看起来像是一个期望，但是对什么是更好的定义
there is a better definition of what is this is - I gave you half of the story -

1219
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,000
这是-我给你讲了一半的故事-是因为Q和P之间的KL差异
there is a better definition of what is this is - I gave you half of the story -

1220
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,570
这是-我给你讲了一半的故事-是因为Q和P之间的KL差异
this is - I gave you half of the story - out of the KL divergence between Q and P

1221
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:30,580
这是-我给你讲了一半的故事-是因为Q和P之间的KL差异
out of the KL divergence between Q and P of 10 times e to the 11 all right so the

1222
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:36,270
是11的10倍e的倍数，所以目标是使总体
out of the KL divergence between Q and P of 10 times e to the 11 all right so the

1223
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,480
是11的10倍e的倍数，所以目标是使总体
of 10 times e to the 11 all right so the objective is to maximize the overall

1224
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:38,490
是11的10倍e的倍数，所以目标是使总体
objective is to maximize the overall lower bound then you have to minimize

1225
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:43,410
下界，那么你必须最小化
objective is to maximize the overall lower bound then you have to minimize

1226
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:43,490
这，我们知道确切的答案，当qfm等于
objective is to maximize the overall lower bound then you have to minimize

1227
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:43,500
这，我们知道确切的答案，当qfm等于


1228
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:51,240
这，我们知道确切的答案，当qfm等于
this and we know the exact answer right this will be optimised when qfm equal to

1229
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:51,250
这，我们知道确切的答案，当qfm等于
this will be optimised when qfm equal to PM e to the LM where the ram is equal

1230
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,690
PM e到LM等于ram的LM，所以现在真的是第一次
this will be optimised when qfm equal to PM e to the LM where the ram is equal

1231
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,360
PM e到LM等于ram的LM，所以现在真的是第一次
PM e to the LM where the ram is equal like that so really now for the first

1232
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:57,370
PM e到LM等于ram的LM，所以现在真的是第一次
like that so really now for the first time you no need to slide you have seen

1233
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:00,330
当您无需滑动时，您已经看到模型的后验
like that so really now for the first time you no need to slide you have seen

1234
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:03,870
当您无需滑动时，您已经看到模型的后验
time you no need to slide you have seen a variational posterior of a model in

1235
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:03,880
当您无需滑动时，您已经看到模型的后验
a variational posterior of a model in two slides okay so you can I mean this

1236
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:12,450
两张幻灯片都可以，所以我可以说，如果您想
a variational posterior of a model in two slides okay so you can I mean this

1237
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:15,090
两张幻灯片都可以，所以我可以说，如果您想
two slides okay so you can I mean this can be extremely useful if you want to

1238
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:15,100
两张幻灯片都可以，所以我可以说，如果您想
can be extremely useful if you want to do model selection in regression

1239
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,700
在回归分类中选择模型只是提及其中
can be extremely useful if you want to do model selection in regression

1240
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:25,770
在回归分类中选择模型只是提及其中
do model selection in regression classification just mention it which

1241
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:25,780
在回归分类中选择模型只是提及其中
classification just mention it which model does the best alright so this

1242
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,200
模型做得最好，所以这给了你一个近似值
classification just mention it which model does the best alright so this

1243
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,970
模型做得最好，所以这给了你一个近似值
model does the best alright so this gives you an approximation give it the

1244
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:29,980
模型做得最好，所以这给了你一个近似值
gives you an approximation give it the data of the posterior over models and if

1245
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,730
模型的后验数据，如果您为模型1 2和3绘制此图，则您
gives you an approximation give it the data of the posterior over models and if

1246
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:36,150
模型的后验数据，如果您为模型1 2和3绘制此图，则您
data of the posterior over models and if you plot this for model 1 2 &amp; 3 etc you

1247
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:36,160
模型的后验数据，如果您为模型1 2和3绘制此图，则您
you plot this for model 1 2 &amp; 3 etc you know you will eventually be able to do

1248
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,180
知道您最终将能够进行模型选择，弄清楚这是什么
you plot this for model 1 2 &amp; 3 etc you know you will eventually be able to do

1249
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,770
知道您最终将能够进行模型选择，弄清楚这是什么
know you will eventually be able to do model selection figure out what's the

1250
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:40,780
知道您最终将能够进行模型选择，弄清楚这是什么
model selection figure out what's the best model that interprets the data okay

1251
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,230
解释数据的最佳模型还可以，因此使用
model selection figure out what's the best model that interprets the data okay

1252
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:48,390
解释数据的最佳模型还可以，因此使用
best model that interprets the data okay so this is a very nice calculation using

1253
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:48,400
解释数据的最佳模型还可以，因此使用
so this is a very nice calculation using variational methods of expense basically

1254
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,250
费用变动法基本上是这个用于分配的概念
so this is a very nice calculation using variational methods of expense basically

型号很好，非常好
models alright so very nice

1262
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,900
1990年的草食，所以他们决定这个，如果有新的
models alright so very nice

1263
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:06,910
1990年的草食，所以他们决定这个，如果有新的


1264
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:13,170
1990年的草食，所以他们决定这个，如果有新的
so

1265
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:13,180
1990年的草食，所以他们决定这个，如果有新的


1266
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:20,370
1990年的草食，所以他们决定这个，如果有新的
the 1990 pastula so they decide on this actually where I can if there is a new

1267
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:20,380
1990年的草食，所以他们决定这个，如果有新的
actually where I can if there is a new tactic that's a little bit more

1268
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,410
这种策略比即将来临的主题要复杂一点，但是
actually where I can if there is a new tactic that's a little bit more

1269
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:26,430
这种策略比即将来临的主题要复杂一点，但是
tactic that's a little bit more complicated than the topics to come but

1270
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:26,440
这种策略比即将来临的主题要复杂一点，但是
complicated than the topics to come but because I need somehow put them together

1271
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,490
因为我需要以某种方式将它们放在一起让我让它正确完成并尝试
complicated than the topics to come but because I need somehow put them together

00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:36,000
因为我需要以某种方式将它们放在一起让我让它正确完成并尝试
because I need somehow put them together let me let me finish it up right and try

1273
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,010
因为我需要以某种方式将它们放在一起让我让它正确完成并尝试
let me let me finish it up right and try to do our best to understand it again

1274
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:47,760
尽我们最大的努力再次理解它，这将是汤姆治安官，有点
let me let me finish it up right and try to do our best to understand it again

1275
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,039
尽我们最大的努力再次理解它，这将是汤姆治安官，有点
to do our best to understand it again this will be by Sheriff Tom it's a bit

1276
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:50,049
尽我们最大的努力再次理解它，这将是汤姆治安官，有点
this will be by Sheriff Tom it's a bit more difficult than some of the problems

1277
00:48:50,049 --> 00:48:52,289
比接下来将要看到的一些问题更困难，但让我们滚蛋
this will be by Sheriff Tom it's a bit more difficult than some of the problems

more difficult than some of the problems we will see next but let's get get out

1279
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:54,880
比接下来将要看到的一些问题更困难，但让我们滚蛋
we will see next but let's get get out of the way okay well first what the

1280
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,200
首先，通心粉是关于什么的，所以您在这里看到的是
we will see next but let's get get out of the way okay well first what the

1281
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,329
首先，通心粉是关于什么的，所以您在这里看到的是
of the way okay well first what the macaronis is about so what you see here

1282
00:49:00,329 --> 00:49:00,339
首先，通心粉是关于什么的，所以您在这里看到的是
macaronis is about so what you see here is a model where you know I mean it

1283
00:49:00,339 --> 00:49:07,609
是一个模型，您知道我的意思是在先前的讲座中下雪了
macaronis is about so what you see here is a model where you know I mean it

1284
00:49:07,609 --> 00:49:10,019
是一个模型，您知道我的意思是在先前的讲座中下雪了
is a model where you know I mean it snows here in earlier lectures the

1288
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:15,339
与我们在hmm的大多数演示中讨论的内容不同的是
most of the presentations from hmm is but we have multiple chains but they're

1289
00:49:15,339 --> 00:49:18,839
但是我们有多个链条，但是它们被链接在一起并且被链接在一起

00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:20,140
但是我们有多个链条，但是它们被链接在一起并且被链接在一起
linked together and they're linked together as you can see because the

1292
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,019
如您所见，因为每次的观察都取决于

1306
00:49:51,779 --> 00:49:51,789
所谓的检控隐马尔可夫模型好了，那我就不
Markov models okay so then I don't highlight basically today it can somehow

1307
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:54,569
今天基本上强调它可以从某种程度上减少一些想法
Markov models okay so then I don't highlight basically today it can somehow

1331
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:41,240
例如，如果您可以认为我的课程提纲真的很好，那就是
approximate method for everything first example if you can think here my

1332
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,240
例如，如果您可以认为我的课程提纲真的很好，那就是
example if you can think here my syllabus is really act alright this is

1333
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:44,250
例如，如果您可以认为我的课程提纲真的很好，那就是
syllabus is really act alright this is the unknown states the data why you can

1334
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,330
未知状态说明数据，为什么您可以在这里坚持很多，所以如果加入

1335
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:53,480
未知状态说明数据，为什么您可以在这里坚持很多，所以如果加入
the unknown states the data why you can stick here much so if the joining

1336
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:53,490
未知状态说明数据，为什么您可以在这里坚持很多，所以如果加入
stick here much so if the joining likelihood is basically my transition

1337
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:56,930
可能性基本上是我从t减去一二三的转换模型
stick here much so if the joining likelihood is basically my transition

1338
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,870
可能性基本上是我从t减去一二三的转换模型

1339
00:50:59,870 --> 00:50:59,880
可能性基本上是我从t减去一二三的转换模型
model from t minus one two three okay and the observation model okay and you

1340
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,040
观察模型还可以，您会注意到这里有一个副本，我是
model from t minus one two three okay and the observation model okay and you

1341
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,690
观察模型还可以，您会注意到这里有一个副本，我是
and the observation model okay and you notice there is a copy here and I'm

1342
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:05,700
观察模型还可以，您会注意到这里有一个副本，我是
notice there is a copy here and I'm gonna show you here explicitly because

1343
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,980
要在这里明确地告诉你，因为为什么P取决于所有这些轴
notice there is a copy here and I'm gonna show you here explicitly because

1344
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,330
要在这里明确地告诉你，因为为什么P取决于所有这些轴
gonna show you here explicitly because why P depends on the axis of all these

1345
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:10,340
要在这里明确地告诉你，因为为什么P取决于所有这些轴
why P depends on the axis of all these state X M alright and this the profit

1346
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:16,930
声明XM好吧，这简让简的利润我的意思是约翰喜欢
why P depends on the axis of all these state X M alright and this the profit

1348
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:20,460
声明XM好吧，这简让简的利润我的意思是约翰喜欢
the Jane looked like I mean John like liquids a product over the change and

1349
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,640
在变更后为产品浇灌液体，并且在所有情况下都能正常运转，因此
the Jane looked like I mean John like liquids a product over the change and

1350
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,220
在变更后为产品浇灌液体，并且在所有情况下都能正常运转，因此
liquids a product over the change and all the time instances teeth okay so the

1351
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:28,230
在变更后为产品浇灌液体，并且在所有情况下都能正常运转，因此
all the time instances teeth okay so the definition is very very similar to what

1352
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:30,560
定义与我们从确切的日志中看到的非常相似
all the time instances teeth okay so the definition is very very similar to what

1354
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:33,030
定义与我们从确切的日志中看到的非常相似
we have seen from the exact logs on a log likelihood that we have seen the

1355
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:34,730
我们已经看到陷阱的对数可能性，所以我们为
we have seen from the exact logs on a log likelihood that we have seen the

1356
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:37,040
我们已经看到陷阱的对数可能性，所以我们为
log likelihood that we have seen the trap so a we give a for the

1357
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,050
我们已经看到陷阱的对数可能性，所以我们为
trap so a we give a for the transition matrix we have some

1358
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,890
过渡矩阵，我们对初始空间有一些概率

probabilities for the initial space which is better from what we have done

1361
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:44,150
这比我们几年前所做的更好，但是有一个很好的指数

1362
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:48,350
这比我们几年前所做的更好，但是有一个很好的指数

1363
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:48,360
这比我们几年前所做的更好，但是有一个很好的指数
before years but there is an index well there is a named exam because this

1364
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,660
有一个命名考试，因为这种过渡概率和初始
before years but there is an index well there is a named exam because this

1365
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,520
有一个命名考试，因为这种过渡概率和初始
there is a named exam because this transition probabilities and initial

1366
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:52,530
有一个命名考试，因为这种过渡概率和初始
transition probabilities and initial probabilities have to refer to its chain

1367
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:54,680
概率必须参考从k 1到M的链K，所以可能性
transition probabilities and initial probabilities have to refer to its chain

1368
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:02,060
概率必须参考从k 1到M的链K，所以可能性

1369
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:02,070
概率必须参考从k 1到M的链K，所以可能性
K from k 1 to M okay so the likelihood model this is departure from what we

1370
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:04,520
模型，这与我们在hmm演示中所做的不同
K from k 1 to M okay so the likelihood model this is departure from what we

1372
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:08,430
模型，这与我们在hmm演示中所做的不同
have done in the hmm presentations it is now the moon is defined to be estimation

1381
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:27,540
系数在这里我们以开始就可以给出，所以均值是

1386
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:42,380
我记得从小等于R到大写M的名字，所以没关系，

1387
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:42,390
我记得从小等于R到大写M的名字，所以没关系，
to capital M okay so this is alright and it's computationally very difficult to

1388
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,480
由于这个等式，因此在计算上很难使用
to capital M okay so this is alright and it's computationally very difficult to

1389
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,150
由于这个等式，因此在计算上很难使用
it's computationally very difficult to work with because of this equation so

1390
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:47,160
由于这个等式，因此在计算上很难使用
work with because of this equation so this equation constraint so you won't be

1391
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,450
这个方程式约束，所以您将无法知道自己是否期望
work with because of this equation so this equation constraint so you won't be

1397
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,500
用于后向消息传递，因为这些消息是耦合的，所以它

1398
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:05,480
用于后向消息传递，因为这些消息是耦合的，所以它

1399
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:05,490
用于后向消息传递，因为这些消息是耦合的，所以它
because these messages are coupled so it will be computationally very big okay so

1400
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:11,240
在计算上会很好，所以我认为确切的后验
because these messages are coupled so it will be computationally very big okay so

1401
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,380
在计算上会很好，所以我认为确切的后验
will be computationally very big okay so I am I think the exact posterior

1406
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:26,030

1412
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:37,010
我们在想肺，所以这里的向量是

1421
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,770
根据我们与hmm讨论的内容，除了现在我拥有的不是

1423
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:56,850
根据我们与hmm讨论的内容，除了现在我拥有的不是
the fact now that I have instead of having one chain I have a summation of

1429
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:05,730
自己的利润初始概率，并且在过渡中具有另一个求和
the transitions have another summation then for all the transition

1430
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:07,490
那么对于所有的转移概率，所以我们需要找到
the transitions have another summation then for all the transition

1431
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,310
那么对于所有的转移概率，所以我们需要找到
then for all the transition probabilities right so we need to find

1432
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:10,320
那么对于所有的转移概率，所以我们需要找到
probabilities right so we need to find some way to

1433
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,680
一些方法来近似推断来解决这个问题
probabilities right so we need to find some way to

1435
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:15,390
一些方法来近似推断来解决这个问题
just approximate inference to solve this problem okay and the idea is the

1436
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:22,400
问题好了，想法是像世界是近似的差异
just approximate inference to solve this problem okay and the idea is the

1438
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:25,109
问题好了，想法是像世界是近似的差异
difference like the world is approximate so miss can you have to use your

1439
00:54:25,109 --> 00:54:27,200
所以小姐，您是否可以使用您的直觉，或者您说我要尝试
difference like the world is approximate so miss can you have to use your

1440
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,720
所以小姐，您是否可以使用您的直觉，或者您说我要尝试
so miss can you have to use your intuition or you say I'm gonna try

1441
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:29,730
所以小姐，您是否可以使用您的直觉，或者您说我要尝试
intuition or you say I'm gonna try something that looks like that and let's

1442
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:31,760
看起来像这样的东西，让我们希望最好
intuition or you say I'm gonna try something that looks like that and let's

1443
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,510
看起来像这样的东西，让我们希望最好
something that looks like that and let's hope for the best

1444
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:32,520
看起来像这样的东西，让我们希望最好
hope for the best all right so the situation we will

1445
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,200
好的，所以我们将要讨论的情况是一个近似值
hope for the best all right so the situation we will

1446
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,520
好的，所以我们将要讨论的情况是一个近似值
all right so the situation we will discuss is an approximation that will

1447
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:40,530
好的，所以我们将要讨论的情况是一个近似值
discuss is an approximation that will decouple the change okay so somehow we

1448
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:45,260
解耦变更好吧，所以我们以某种方式将它们解耦，这样我们就可以成为
discuss is an approximation that will decouple the change okay so somehow we

1449
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:50,059
解耦变更好吧，所以我们以某种方式将它们解耦，这样我们就可以成为
decouple the change okay so somehow we decouple them so that way we can become

1450
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:50,069
解耦变更好吧，所以我们以某种方式将它们解耦，这样我们就可以成为
decouple them so that way we can become messages back and forth basically change

1451
00:54:50,069 --> 00:54:53,319
现在，来回消息基本上独立地更改为其中的几个
decouple them so that way we can become messages back and forth basically change

1452
00:54:53,319 --> 00:54:56,960
现在，来回消息基本上独立地更改为其中的几个
messages back and forth basically change independently now to the couple of them

1453
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:56,970
现在，来回消息基本上独立地更改为其中的几个
independently now to the couple of them let me just tell you what the idea is

1454
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:58,640
让我告诉你这个主意显然是什么，所以如果我们尝试近似
independently now to the couple of them let me just tell you what the idea is

1455
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:11,390
让我告诉你这个主意显然是什么，所以如果我们尝试近似
let me just tell you what the idea is obviously so if we try to approximate

1456
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:11,400
让我告诉你这个主意显然是什么，所以如果我们尝试近似
obviously so if we try to approximate them it's independent can you imagine in

1457
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,240
它们是独立的，您能在保持近似的情况下想象吗
obviously so if we try to approximate them it's independent can you imagine in

1458
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,400
它们是独立的，您能在保持近似的情况下想象吗
them it's independent can you imagine in the context of maintained approximations

1459
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:16,410
它们是独立的，您能在保持近似的情况下想象吗
the context of maintained approximations something we need to do to get rid of

1460
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:19,760
我们需要做的一些事情来摆脱这个术语，这是
the context of maintained approximations something we need to do to get rid of

1461
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,370
我们需要做的一些事情来摆脱这个术语，这是
something we need to do to get rid of this term here this is the evidence for

1462
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:22,380
我们需要做的一些事情来摆脱这个术语，这是
this term here this is the evidence for typos everything together

1463
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,170
错别字，所有内容都可以让您想起某种您知道的东西
this term here this is the evidence for typos everything together

1464
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:29,710
错别字，所有内容都可以让您想起某种您知道的东西
typos everything together can you think of some sort of you know

1465
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:29,720
错别字，所有内容都可以让您想起某种您知道的东西
can you think of some sort of you know idea with a backward message passing on

1466
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:36,950
一个向后消息传递相同的想法，但我们将能够
can you think of some sort of you know idea with a backward message passing on

1467
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:39,200
一个向后消息传递相同的想法，但我们将能够
idea with a backward message passing on its same but we're going to be able to

1468
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:39,210
一个向后消息传递相同的想法，但我们将能够
its same but we're going to be able to account mission is I mean it's insane

1469
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:49,609
帐户任务是我的意思是疯狂，但实际上
its same but we're going to be able to account mission is I mean it's insane

1470
00:55:49,609 --> 00:55:51,980
帐户任务是我的意思是疯狂，但实际上
account mission is I mean it's insane does really does but in the average

1471
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:51,990
帐户任务是我的意思是疯狂，但实际上
does really does but in the average sentence to detect so we need to abuse

1472
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:56,660
句子来检测，所以我们需要滥用一些证据不容错过的概念
does really does but in the average sentence to detect so we need to abuse

1473
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:59,809
句子来检测，所以我们需要滥用一些证据不容错过的概念
sentence to detect so we need to abuse some concept of evidenced not miss

1474
00:55:59,809 --> 00:55:59,819
句子来检测，所以我们需要滥用一些证据不容错过的概念
some concept of evidenced not miss evidence but some local evidence that is

1475
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:02,660
证据，但在每个出现的链条中都引入了一些当地证据
some concept of evidenced not miss evidence but some local evidence that is

1476
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,819
证据，但在每个出现的链条中都引入了一些当地证据
evidence but some local evidence that is introduced in every chain that comes

1477
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:04,829
证据，但在每个出现的链条中都引入了一些当地证据
introduced in every chain that comes from the fact of all the change make

1478
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:09,680
从所有变化的事实来看是有道理的
introduced in every chain that comes from the fact of all the change make

1479
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,870
从所有变化的事实来看是有道理的
from the fact of all the change make sense

1480
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:10,880
从所有变化的事实来看是有道理的
sense all right so we're gonna run them

1481
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,270
好的，所以我们要独立运行它们，但是必须有一些
sense all right so we're gonna run them

1482
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,980
好的，所以我们要独立运行它们，但是必须有一些
all right so we're gonna run them independently but there must be some

1483
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:14,990
好的，所以我们要独立运行它们，但是必须有一些
independently but there must be some things that influences would say train

1484
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:19,000
有影响力的事情会说训练一个，因为这种变化在某些方面
independently but there must be some things that influences would say train

1485
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,430
有影响力的事情会说训练一个，因为这种变化在某些方面
things that influences would say train one because this change had in some

1486
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:21,440
有影响力的事情会说训练一个，因为这种变化在某些方面
one because this change had in some state okay so here right actually one of

1487
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,290
声明好吧，所以实际上这里是您在这些问题上需要的问题之一
one because this change had in some state okay so here right actually one of

1488
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:31,150
声明好吧，所以实际上这里是您在这些问题上需要的问题之一
state okay so here right actually one of the questions you need on the on those

1489
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:31,160
声明好吧，所以实际上这里是您在这些问题上需要的问题之一
the questions you need on the on those three lines so this evidence at this

1490
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:37,030
三行，所以这个证据在这个时候我称之为c PM k好，时间T
the questions you need on the on those three lines so this evidence at this

1491
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:47,290
三行，所以这个证据在这个时候我称之为c PM k好，时间T
three lines so this evidence at this time I call it c PM k alright and time T

1492
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:47,300
三行，所以这个证据在这个时候我称之为c PM k好，时间T
time I call it c PM k alright and time T it refers to chain M okay and tell them

1493
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:51,520
它指的是链M并告诉他们，因为监听hmm可以处于状态K
time I call it c PM k alright and time T it refers to chain M okay and tell them

1494
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:58,720
它指的是链M并告诉他们，因为监听hmm可以处于状态K
it refers to chain M okay and tell them because listen hmm can be in state K is

1495
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:58,730
它指的是链M并告诉他们，因为监听hmm可以处于状态K
because listen hmm can be in state K is what stated this so tell us what is c TM

1496
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:02,200
这么说是什么，所以告诉我们这里的c TM k试图做什么
because listen hmm can be in state K is what stated this so tell us what is c TM

1497
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:08,050
这么说是什么，所以告诉我们这里的c TM k试图做什么
what stated this so tell us what is c TM k trying to do in this equation here

1498
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:08,460
没有证据表明没有发布会从图片中消失
what stated this so tell us what is c TM k trying to do in this equation here

1499
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:08,470
没有证据表明没有发布会从图片中消失


1500
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:14,440
没有证据表明没有发布会从图片中消失
there's no evidence there's no the release will disappear from the picture

1501
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:14,450
没有证据表明没有发布会从图片中消失
release will disappear from the picture there's no evidence or anything like

1502
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:15,940
没有证据或类似的东西
release will disappear from the picture there's no evidence or anything like

1503
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:16,210
没有证据或类似的东西
there's no evidence or anything like that

1504
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:16,220
没有证据或类似的东西
that right when the evidence comes from this

1505
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:19,420
正确，当证据来自此，因此我们将进行此测试确实是
that right when the evidence comes from this

1506
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:22,720
正确，当证据来自此，因此我们将进行此测试确实是
right when the evidence comes from this exists so we'll do this test really are

1507
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:22,730
正确，当证据来自此，因此我们将进行此测试确实是
exists so we'll do this test really are trying to accomplish the way that you

1508
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,430
试图完成您在幻灯片上看到它们的方式
exists so we'll do this test really are trying to accomplish the way that you

1509
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:27,220
试图完成您在幻灯片上看到它们的方式
trying to accomplish the way that you see them on the slide

1510
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,840
因此，例如，您知道这是从时间t开始的火车em的过渡
trying to accomplish the way that you see them on the slide

1511
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:29,850
因此，例如，您知道这是从时间t开始的火车em的过渡


1512
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:34,580
因此，例如，您知道这是从时间t开始的火车em的过渡
so for example you know this is a transition for train em from time t

1513
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:34,590
因此，例如，您知道这是从时间t开始的火车em的过渡
transition for train em from time t minus 1 t 2 t but you notice I'm

1514
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:36,980
负1吨2吨，但您注意到我在Shion上对其进行了调节
transition for train em from time t minus 1 t 2 t but you notice I'm

1515
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:41,810
负1吨2吨，但您注意到我在Shion上对其进行了调节
minus 1 t 2 t but you notice I'm conditioning it on Shion

1516
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:46,770
所以注册，我们不是说这个人讨论过这个词，不是意思
minus 1 t 2 t but you notice I'm conditioning it on Shion

1517
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:46,780
所以注册，我们不是说这个人讨论过这个词，不是意思


1518
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:51,090
所以注册，我们不是说这个人讨论过这个词，不是意思
so register we don't mean a word discussed this man so not meaning are

1519
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:51,100
所以注册，我们不是说这个人讨论过这个词，不是意思
discussed this man so not meaning are you going to attach to this chaps

1520
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,380
你会喜欢这个家伙
discussed this man so not meaning are you going to attach to this chaps

1521
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,480
举办了一个研讨会，我很高兴他们必须完成他们，我们不知道他们在哪里
discussed this man so not meaning are you going to attach to this chaps

1522
00:57:59,480 --> 00:57:59,490
举办了一个研讨会，我很高兴他们必须完成他们，我们不知道他们在哪里


1523
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:03,530
举办了一个研讨会，我很高兴他们必须完成他们，我们不知道他们在哪里
hosted a seminar I was well they have to complete them we have no idea where they

1524
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:03,540
举办了一个研讨会，我很高兴他们必须完成他们，我们不知道他们在哪里
complete them we have no idea where they are but we're trying to mimic something

1525
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,870
是，但是我们正在尝试模仿某些东西，无论我们是否正在尝试模仿这里的
complete them we have no idea where they are but we're trying to mimic something

1526
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:10,190
是，但是我们正在尝试模仿某些东西，无论我们是否正在尝试模仿这里的
are but we're trying to mimic something whether we're trying to mimic here a

1527
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,580
高斯混合体
are but we're trying to mimic something whether we're trying to mimic here a

我记得这里的这种黏土是因为我已经将它们解锁


1532
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:49,840
我记得这里的这种黏土是因为我已经将它们解锁
I remember like this this clay thing here is because I have unchain them

1533
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,400
对，所以这是唯一可以让我介绍当地人的地方
I remember like this this clay thing here is because I have unchain them

1534
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:50,410
对，所以这是唯一可以让我介绍当地人的地方


1535
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:56,380
对，所以这是唯一可以让我介绍当地人的地方
right so this is the only place that will allow me to introduce local

1536
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:56,390
对，所以这是唯一可以让我介绍当地人的地方
will allow me to introduce local evidence in the model all right so in

1537
00:58:56,390 --> 00:59:01,240
模型中的证据还可以，因此从本质上讲消除了所有这些
will allow me to introduce local evidence in the model all right so in

1538
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,160
模型中的证据还可以，因此从本质上讲消除了所有这些
evidence in the model all right so in essence getting rid of all of these

1539
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:03,170
模型中的证据还可以，因此从本质上讲消除了所有这些
essence getting rid of all of these things right we're going to do a

1540
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:04,420
正确的事情，我们将做一个变化近似消除
essence getting rid of all of these things right we're going to do a

1541
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,640
正确的事情，我们将做一个变化近似消除
things right we're going to do a variation approximation getting rid of

1542
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:06,650
正确的事情，我们将做一个变化近似消除
variation approximation getting rid of this cutting here all right so this

1543
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:09,010
这个切口在这里好吧，所以这将是一个身体痣，占
variation approximation getting rid of this cutting here all right so this

1544
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:13,300
这个切口在这里好吧，所以这将是一个身体痣，占
this cutting here all right so this would be a body mole that accounts for

1545
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:13,310
这个切口在这里好吧，所以这将是一个身体痣，占
would be a body mole that accounts for the effect of all the other change from

1546
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:16,390
来自中国的所有其他变化的影响，好吧，我们不知道K的G
would be a body mole that accounts for the effect of all the other change from

1547
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:22,630
来自中国的所有其他变化的影响，好吧，我们不知道K的G
the effect of all the other change from China okay we have no idea what G of K

1548
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:22,640
来自中国的所有其他变化的影响，好吧，我们不知道K的G
China okay we have no idea what G of K is so we're gonna have to go in

1549
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,430
是这样，我们将不得不进行计算，或者您知道已编写
China okay we have no idea what G of K is so we're gonna have to go in

1550
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:36,430
是这样，我们将不得不进行计算，或者您知道已编写
is so we're gonna have to go in computation or you know is written

1551
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:36,440
是这样，我们将不得不进行计算，或者您知道已编写
computation or you know is written basically like this okay this is for the

1552
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,670
基本上是这样，这是针对初始状态的，所以我们知道是针对每个状态的
computation or you know is written basically like this okay this is for the

1553
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:42,580
基本上是这样，这是针对初始状态的，所以我们知道是针对每个状态的
basically like this okay this is for the initial state so as we know is for every

1554
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:42,590
基本上是这样，这是针对初始状态的，所以我们知道是针对每个状态的
initial state so as we know is for every chain from M 1 to M so this is for the

1555
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:46,360
从M 1到M的链条，所以这是他们每趟火车的初始状态，
initial state so as we know is for every chain from M 1 to M so this is for the

1556
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,430
从M 1到M的链条，所以这是他们每趟火车的初始状态，
chain from M 1 to M so this is for the initial state in every train them and

1557
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:48,440
从M 1到M的链条，所以这是他们每趟火车的初始状态，
initial state in every train them and this is for the for each type for each

1558
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,440
这是针对每个链M的每种类型，从t减1到
initial state in every train them and this is for the for each type for each

1559
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,320
这是针对每个链M的每种类型，从t减1到
this is for the for each type for each chain M the transition from t minus 1 to

1560
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:53,330
这是针对每个链M的每种类型，从t减1到
chain M the transition from t minus 1 to t ok this is thunder what is different

1561
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:56,620
好的，这是雷声这里不同的是，我们的条件是这些
chain M the transition from t minus 1 to t ok this is thunder what is different

1562
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,080
好的，这是雷声这里不同的是，我们的条件是这些
t ok this is thunder what is different here is that we conditions is these

1563
00:59:59,080 --> 00:59:59,090
好的，这是雷声这里不同的是，我们的条件是这些
here is that we conditions is these things of local evidence 3 okay and the

1564
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:02,470
地方证据的事3还可以，并且定义了两个变体
here is that we conditions is these things of local evidence 3 okay and the

1565
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:04,420
地方证据的事3还可以，并且定义了两个变体
things of local evidence 3 okay and the definition of the two variation

1566
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:04,430
地方证据的事3还可以，并且定义了两个变体
definition of the two variation distributions is what you see here okay

1567
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:07,150
分布就是您在这里看到的，好吧，这与之前的情况相同
definition of the two variation distributions is what you see here okay

1568
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:09,340
分布就是您在这里看到的，好吧，这与之前的情况相同
distributions is what you see here okay this is the same as before this is the

1569
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:09,350
分布就是您在这里看到的，好吧，这与之前的情况相同
this is the same as before this is the same as before this is now we plug it in

1570
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:11,740
与以前一样，现在我们将其插入以帮助说明主要工艺
this is the same as before this is the same as before this is now we plug it in

1571
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:16,000
与以前一样，现在我们将其插入以帮助说明主要工艺
same as before this is now we plug it in helping to account for the main craft if

1572
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,010
与以前一样，现在我们将其插入以帮助说明主要工艺
helping to account for the main craft if you like or probably other change from

1573

1706
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:18,339
您需要对其进行规范化，这就是为什么要获得这些zq和锁的原因
you need to normalize them and that's why you get these locks of zq and locks

1707
01:05:18,339 --> 01:05:18,349
您需要对其进行规范化，这就是为什么要获得这些zq和锁的原因
why you get these locks of zq and locks of Z but apart from that the rest is

1708
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:20,890
的Z，但除此之外，其余只是历史，这是非常简单的
why you get these locks of zq and locks of Z but apart from that the rest is

01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:50,670
X点加上一些噪声，这些噪声是由精度数据在这里定义的，所以基本上我是
by the precision data so basically I'm taking that the likelihood of data is a

1769
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:54,920
认为数据的可能性是其授权的成千上万的乘积
by the precision data so basically I'm taking that the likelihood of data is a

product of thousands it's authorized over the iid day okay so a standard okay

1772
01:07:56,850 --> 01:08:03,460
在开斋节那天还可以，所以通常情况下，您在贝叶斯（Bayesian）所做的一切都很好

在开斋节那天还可以，所以通常情况下，您在贝叶斯（Bayesian）所做的一切都很好
usually what you do in in Bayesian regression you're going to put some

1775
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,210
回归你会给假人一些底漆在这里给一些
usually what you do in in Bayesian regression you're going to put some

1776
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:11,500

regression you're going to put some primer on the dummy here given some

1777
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:11,510
回归你会给假人一些底漆在这里给一些
primer on the dummy here given some precision alpha alright and then you put

1778
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:18,680
精度alpha好吧，然后您将其放在优先位置上，我会看到
primer on the dummy here given some precision alpha alright and then you put

1779
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:24,260
精度alpha好吧，然后您将其放在优先位置上，我会看到
precision alpha alright and then you put some prior on that is taking I'll see

1780
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:24,270
精度alpha好吧，然后您将其放在优先位置上，我会看到
some prior on that is taking I'll see you at within this you can make this a

1781
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:25,760
您可以在其中使它成为alpha的向量，并且您可以
some prior on that is taking I'll see you at within this you can make this a

1782
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,860
您可以在其中使它成为alpha的向量，并且您可以
you at within this you can make this a vector of alphas and you can do

1783
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:27,870
您可以在其中使它成为alpha的向量，并且您可以
vector of alphas and you can do relevance determination and all the this

but right now there's only one alpha alright and

1789
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:37,080
但是现在只有一个Alpha好了
alright and and so what a bad review a laptop is the

1790
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:41,840
因此，对笔记本电脑的不好评价是，先前的，令人恐惧的玩具和其他超级玩具
alright and and so what a bad review a laptop is the

1791
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,450
因此，对笔记本电脑的不好评价是，先前的，令人恐惧的玩具和其他超级玩具
and so what a bad review a laptop is the prior and fearful toys and other hyper

1792
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:44,460
因此，对笔记本电脑的不好评价是，先前的，令人恐惧的玩具和其他超级玩具

solution we have done it ok and become Scouts for any X so and this tradition

1797
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:17,850
解决方案，我们做的还不错，可以成为任何X的侦察兵，这一传统
Scouts for any X so and this tradition where you know so basically an internet

1798
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:22,849
如果您想到任何地方的生计，就基本上了解互联网
Scouts for any X so and this tradition where you know so basically an internet

1799
01:09:22,849 --> 01:09:25,400
如果您想到任何地方的生计，就基本上了解互联网
where you know so basically an internet if you think of the livelihood at any

1800
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:25,410
如果您想到任何地方的生计，就基本上了解互联网
if you think of the livelihood at any location X you know times the posterior

of W integrand of the solutions to all of this but we pretend we don't know any

1804
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:33,590
这个，但我们假装我们对此一无所知，我们真的很想看看
of W integrand of the solutions to all of this but we pretend we don't know any

1805
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:36,770
这个，但我们假装我们对此一无所知，我们真的很想看看
of this but we pretend we don't know any of this and we really want to see

1806
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:36,780
这个，但我们假装我们对此一无所知，我们真的很想看看
of this and we really want to see Bayesian inference will actually is the

1807
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:50,930
贝叶斯推断实际上是数据决定观察结果认为我是
of this and we really want to see Bayesian inference will actually is the

1808
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:56,020
贝叶斯推断实际上是数据决定观察结果认为我是
Bayesian inference will actually is the data decide the observations think I'm

1809
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:56,030
贝叶斯推断实际上是数据决定观察结果认为我是
data decide the observations think I'm corresponding axis right so I only did

1810
01:09:56,030 --> 01:10:01,850
相应的轴正确，所以我今年才做，但请记住，这是
data decide the observations think I'm corresponding axis right so I only did

1811
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:04,850
相应的轴正确，所以我今年才做，但请记住，这是
corresponding axis right so I only did that this year but remember this is

1812
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:04,860
相应的轴正确，所以我今年才做，但请记住，这是
that this year but remember this is conditional on the axis as well okay

1813
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:06,860
以轴为条件，好吧，弄乱轴并不重要
that this year but remember this is conditional on the axis as well okay

1814
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:09,260
以轴为条件，好吧，弄乱轴并不重要
conditional on the axis as well okay it's not important to mess up the

1815
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:09,270
以轴为条件，好吧，弄乱轴并不重要
it's not important to mess up the notation so the the likelihood is nice

1816
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:15,860
记法，所以可能性很好，完全像那个，没有WI不知道是什么
it's not important to mess up the notation so the the likelihood is nice

1817
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,560
记法，所以可能性很好，完全像那个，没有WI不知道是什么
notation so the the likelihood is nice exactly like that right no W I know what

arrived with updated parameters because you can see never fast but here local

1892
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:49,480
您可能看不到快，但这里是当地居民，所以您的零加M
arrived with updated parameters because you can see never fast but here local

1893
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,970
您可能看不到快，但这里是当地居民，所以您的零加M

1894
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:51,980
您可能看不到快，但这里是当地居民，所以您的零加M
populace so you have a zero plus M over 2 minus 1 so the first coefficient is a

1895
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:54,460
2减去1，因此第一个系数为零，加上2上的10，并且BN等于

2减去1，因此第一个系数为零，加上2上的10，并且BN等于
zero plus 10 over 2 and BN is equal to that so T of a is a gamma distribution

1898
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:58,780
所以a的T是伽马分布而不是putz
zero plus 10 over 2 and BN is equal to that so T of a is a gamma distribution

1899
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:01,870

expectation that means I suppose now here so you obviously have to couple the

1925
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,260
在这里，所以您显然必须将两个方程式耦合好，好吧，所以
expectation that means I suppose now here so you obviously have to couple the

1926
01:14:56,260 --> 01:15:01,950
在这里，所以您显然必须将两个方程式耦合好，好吧，所以
here so you obviously have to couple the two equations okay so alright so

1927
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:01,960
在这里，所以您显然必须将两个方程式耦合好，好吧，所以
two equations okay so alright so actually the results it says here from

唯一的区别是，如果您使用alpha的期望值，可以
the only difference is basically if you use the expectation of alpha all right

1936
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:16,070
唯一的区别是，如果您使用alpha的期望值，可以
use the expectation of alpha all right but we got those in the trivial manner

1937
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:18,220
但我们以微不足道的方式获得了这些信息，从某种意义上讲，您知道它告诉您
