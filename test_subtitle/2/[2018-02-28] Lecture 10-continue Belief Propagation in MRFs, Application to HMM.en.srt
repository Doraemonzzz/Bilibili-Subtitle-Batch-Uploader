00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:48,740
welcome to another class on Republican graphical models so we were summarizing

2
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,870
graphical models so we were summarizing basically an example of reduction three

3
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,570
basically an example of reduction three algorithms so before I discussed the

4
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,100
algorithms so before I discussed the example once more I wanted to remind you

5
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,030
example once more I wanted to remind you the message passing that is applied by

6
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,880
the message passing that is applied by the junction tree algorithm and there is

7
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,040
the junction tree algorithm and there is no unfortunately schematic here I may

8
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,980
no unfortunately schematic here I may need to add the schematic but basically

9
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,800
need to add the schematic but basically what we have is we have a situation

10
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:19,100
what we have is we have a situation where I have one you know one maximal

11
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,280
where I have one you know one maximal clique that we call it V to the left and

12
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,860
clique that we call it V to the left and another W to the right in between them

13
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,800
another W to the right in between them we have the separator s so the idea was

14
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,130
we have the separator s so the idea was passing messages from V to W in a

15
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,260
passing messages from V to W in a forward manner this equation on the top

16
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,010
forward manner this equation on the top and then on reversed passing messages

17
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,750
and then on reversed passing messages from W back to me through the separator

18
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,920
from W back to me through the separator so I want to review with you the

19
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,280
so I want to review with you the question so then we will try to see this

20
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,060
question so then we will try to see this in a very specific example on what

21
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,630
in a very specific example on what exactly we tried to do so if you

22
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,340
exactly we tried to do so if you remember the separator involves the

23
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,050
remember the separator involves the variables that they are common to both V

24
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,190
variables that they are common to both V and W so obviously to show me initially

25
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,100
and W so obviously to show me initially initialize the separator potentials to 1

26
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,050
initialize the separator potentials to 1 ok so obviously to update the separator

27
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,030
ok so obviously to update the separator potentials we have to integrate out all

28
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,730
potentials we have to integrate out all the volume Wilson V except the very much

29
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,330
the volume Wilson V except the very much in the separator right so Ross V minor

30
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,720
in the separator right so Ross V minor says they are not relevant information

31
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,910
says they are not relevant information for W so we have to integrate them out

32
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:28,010
for W so we have to integrate them out so this is pissed R subscript s means

33
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,940
so this is pissed R subscript s means the potential of the separator is this

34
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,030
the potential of the separator is this then we go to W and we update the

35
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,330
then we go to W and we update the potential of the maximal clique W by

36
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,720
potential of the maximal clique W by multiplying by this factor of the

37
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,970
multiplying by this factor of the updated separator potential divided by

38
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,710
updated separator potential divided by the original separator potential and

39
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,159
the original separator potential and obviously when you start the algorithm

40
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:51,059
obviously when you start the algorithm first is equal to one in the process

41
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,769
first is equal to one in the process we've been tax really great

42
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,290
we've been tax really great so the objective just to be consistent

43
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,659
so the objective just to be consistent because everything has one star the

44
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:04,290
because everything has one star the updated cyber cyber star is equal to

45
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,480
updated cyber cyber star is equal to original the type II that we started

46
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,879
original the type II that we started with right now in the propagation of

47
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:16,050
with right now in the propagation of messages from W back to V so we are

48
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,929
messages from W back to V so we are going to update the separator potential

49
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:21,779
going to update the separator potential by starting with the potential of W and

50
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:24,119
by starting with the potential of W and you've never lost the ability potential

51
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:26,279
you've never lost the ability potential that we computed here and we're gonna

52
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,510
that we computed here and we're gonna integrate you have pretty valuable

53
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,439
integrate you have pretty valuable except desktop then we're going to go to

54
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,950
except desktop then we're going to go to the potential of the click V and take

55
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,689
the potential of the click V and take the previous value which is this and

56
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:39,719
the previous value which is this and update it began by multiplying with this

57
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:42,709
update it began by multiplying with this three double star divided by pitstop

58
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:47,129
three double star divided by pitstop alright so this is the new value of the

59
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,290
alright so this is the new value of the separator divided by the old value the

60
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,600
separator divided by the old value the new value is this the old values what we

61
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,269
new value is this the old values what we computed on the previous step as we go

62
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:58,320
computed on the previous step as we go from V to W and a mystic process again W

63
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:04,709
from V to W and a mystic process again W doesn't change the equations look weird

64
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,869
doesn't change the equations look weird but what is interesting is when we do

65
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:12,719
but what is interesting is when we do this update the the calculations are

66
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:15,839
this update the the calculations are consistent consistent in the sense that

67
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,989
consistent consistent in the sense that if you calculate the separation

68
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:24,389
if you calculate the separation potential by starting with this click

69
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:27,179
potential by starting with this click for W and you integrate average

70
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:30,209
for W and you integrate average everything out except s1 if you start

71
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:31,889
everything out except s1 if you start with a click of V and you integrate

72
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:35,760
with a click of V and you integrate everything out except s this is equal to

73
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,360
everything out except s this is equal to rot so result

74
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,320
rot so result consistent secure at the end of the day

75
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,830
consistent secure at the end of the day the separator potential is calculated

76
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,410
the separator potential is calculated uniquely there's no double star shared

77
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,360
uniquely there's no double star shared because you remember side double star

78
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,450
because you remember side double star maybe I should put it to look nicer side

79
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,870
maybe I should put it to look nicer side double star W is equal to PI star of

80
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,390
double star W is equal to PI star of that be okay and another thing that we

81
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,480
that be okay and another thing that we mentioned was that both in the forward

82
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,870
mentioned was that both in the forward and the backward swept the joint

83
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,400
and the backward swept the joint probability distribution of both the

84
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,910
probability distribution of both the variables in the junction tree remains

85
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,630
variables in the junction tree remains invariant physically okay and I have I

86
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,600
invariant physically okay and I have I don't think we missed a premium example

87
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,540
don't think we missed a premium example right click will say be here another

88
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,930
right click will say be here another colleague would be ste so actually you

89
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,320
colleague would be ste so actually you can take this as a simple example of the

90
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,560
can take this as a simple example of the previous case that I held so before we

91
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,400
previous case that I held so before we have BMW so this here is a and B WS b n3

92
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,700
have BMW so this here is a and B WS b n3 and the separator is b so that i am

93
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,110
and the separator is b so that i am showing you here with a very simple

94
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,100
showing you here with a very simple calculation is that each step in the

95
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,000
calculation is that each step in the process all effects basically remains

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,570
process all effects basically remains the same

97
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,730
the same alright so we're not really playing with

98
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,980
alright so we're not really playing with the joint distribution and a simple

99
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,680
the joint distribution and a simple proof in the forward step is the

100
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,610
proof in the forward step is the following if you calculate size style of

101
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,840
following if you calculate size style of V times y star of W divided by the

102
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,480
V times y star of W divided by the separator potential star but the way I

103
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,470
separator potential star but the way I remind you in a junction tree because

104
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,090
remind you in a junction tree because originally we started with the stability

105
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,700
originally we started with the stability potential equal to 1 we hide the Joint

106
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,310
potential equal to 1 we hide the Joint Distribution as the product of the

107
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,440
Distribution as the product of the potentials of all the cliques in the

108
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,880
potentials of all the cliques in the numerator divided by the product of the

109
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,520
numerator divided by the product of the potentials of all the separators so we

110
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,200
potentials of all the separators so we don't double count effectively for the

111
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,840
don't double count effectively for the separator right because

112
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,950
separator right because we have two potentials that say V and W

113
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,500
we have two potentials that say V and W right and they serve the separator

114
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,890
right and they serve the separator potential so we divide by that of course

115
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,320
potential so we divide by that of course initially this is equal to answer it's

116
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,660
initially this is equal to answer it's not an issue but I wanted to show you

117
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,600
not an issue but I wanted to show you that this remaining sequel to the

118
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,610
that this remaining sequel to the original joint probability distribution

119
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,820
original joint probability distribution at every step and we can see it here in

120
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,340
at every step and we can see it here in the forward step so if I calculate this

121
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,190
the forward step so if I calculate this quantity here and I stopped you beside

122
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,770
quantity here and I stopped you beside this table I remind you besides star

123
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,740
this table I remind you besides star doesn't change on the forward step so

124
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,150
doesn't change on the forward step so it's I've a the update of side W is the

125
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,330
it's I've a the update of side W is the website W times the sub J factor with

126
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,060
website W times the sub J factor with the new separator potential divided by

127
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:19,330
the new separator potential divided by the old times try W so in T star and P R

128
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,670
the old times try W so in T star and P R star cancel out and basically what you

129
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,590
star cancel out and basically what you get is you get the joint probability

130
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,680
get is you get the joint probability distribution that we started with so

131
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,980
distribution that we started with so effectively the do manipulations of the

132
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,690
effectively the do manipulations of the potentials for the maximal cliques and

133
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,000
potentials for the maximal cliques and the separators but in the process fire

134
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,840
the separators but in the process fire effects remain the same so we will see

135
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,910
effects remain the same so we will see an example what exactly form this

136
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,760
an example what exactly form this potential take with a very simple case

137
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,030
potential take with a very simple case but I think I started discussing this

138
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:56,980
but I think I started discussing this one on Tuesday so the example we talking

139
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,370
one on Tuesday so the example we talking about hidden models today surrounding

140
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,130
about hidden models today surrounding maybe spend two or three lectures so we

141
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,890
maybe spend two or three lectures so we do this sort of in some detail but I

142
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,170
do this sort of in some detail but I won't give you an application of the

143
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,560
won't give you an application of the junction tree algorithm on a hidden

144
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,520
junction tree algorithm on a hidden Markov model so then this is front of

145
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,390
Markov model so then this is front of the most on the mental model for

146
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,450
the most on the mental model for dynamics okay and

147
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,970
dynamics okay and the idea here is we have some

148
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,930
the idea here is we have some observations y0 y1 YT y capital

149
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,560
observations y0 y1 YT y capital traversal in time I mean I'm

150
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,660
traversal in time I mean I'm interpreting here it's time since we

151
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,550
interpreting here it's time since we talked about dynamics but to be any

152
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,920
talked about dynamics but to be any sequence to really and this are some

153
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,040
sequence to really and this are some hidden state okay

154
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,280
hidden state okay and but we don't know what they are and

155
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,950
and but we don't know what they are and so what we do is we have a dynamical

156
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,110
so what we do is we have a dynamical model in this case a Markovian model

157
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,530
model in this case a Markovian model that tells me how I move from the state

158
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,860
that tells me how I move from the state a time that say one to the time 2 and

159
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,019
a time that say one to the time 2 and then I have an observation model that

160
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,490
then I have an observation model that tells me as which state what's the

161
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,040
tells me as which state what's the probability of observing let's say y1

162
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,350
probability of observing let's say y1 given Q 1 so effectively I have a joint

163
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,829
given Q 1 so effectively I have a joint distribution that looks like this again

164
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:13,870
distribution that looks like this again we're going to give you a risk

165
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,329
we're going to give you a risk interpretation on what this model is

166
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:20,700
interpretation on what this model is good right in starting today basically

167
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,960
good right in starting today basically maybe the excuse that we reach this

168
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,930
maybe the excuse that we reach this point but the for now the Joint

169
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,040
point but the for now the Joint Distribution is basically this is a

170
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,460
Distribution is basically this is a directed graph is where you start right

171
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,430
directed graph is where you start right and the probability of the initial state

172
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,860
and the probability of the initial state and then you have the probability of for

173
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,610
and then you have the probability of for reservation loaders given the state

174
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,230
reservation loaders given the state which we take them to be independent

175
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,870
which we take them to be independent okay so given Q these wives are

176
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,560
okay so given Q these wives are independent and the independence comes

177
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,769
independent and the independence comes from this separation you can see that y

178
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:56,350
from this separation you can see that y 0 to the end of y 1 given this state

179
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,079
0 to the end of y 1 given this state because if you go this way it is and

180
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,840
because if you go this way it is and this is given the path is blocked here

181
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,750
this is given the path is blocked here all right but again not very important

182
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,110
all right but again not very important for this lecture and then we have the

183
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,960
for this lecture and then we have the product of these transition

184
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,190
product of these transition probabilities but basically give me how

185
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,990
probabilities but basically give me how from the state PT I go through T plus 1

186
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,079
from the state PT I go through T plus 1 I mean I have a graphical model that has

187
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,519
I mean I have a graphical model that has a joint distribution that looks like

188
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,949
a joint distribution that looks like this and I would like somehow to go and

189
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:28,650
this and I would like somehow to go and and apply the junction tree algorithm

190
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:34,819
and apply the junction tree algorithm and see if it sort of makes that now

191
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:37,410
and see if it sort of makes that now this looks like it's saying right even

192
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,970
this looks like it's saying right even though we do have observations so you

193
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,460
though we do have observations so you remember for change we derive the

194
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,009
remember for change we derive the coordinate message this alpha we derive

195
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:46,410
coordinate message this alpha we derive the backward messages beta and I'm going

196
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,759
the backward messages beta and I'm going to give you the recursive equations

197
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,329
to give you the recursive equations again and we will see that of this about

198
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:54,449
again and we will see that of this about what the Rama message just as well so

199
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:57,300
what the Rama message just as well so the idea is now the junction tree was

200
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,860
the idea is now the junction tree was going to give us something distant some

201
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,590
going to give us something distant some shape of the Americans were somehow able

202
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,160
shape of the Americans were somehow able love for this trivial problem we give us

203
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,920
love for this trivial problem we give us things but plate they look very familiar

204
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,829
things but plate they look very familiar interesting actually writes a realized

205
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:12,030
interesting actually writes a realized application to see what we get from this

206
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:15,749
application to see what we get from this model so the joint probability

207
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:18,540
model so the joint probability distribution again I am not gonna bother

208
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,100
distribution again I am not gonna bother actually relations we're going to see

209
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,110
actually relations we're going to see this in in next week so with the

210
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,970
this in in next week so with the junction tree I believe right if we do

211
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:32,549
junction tree I believe right if we do things correctly given some evidence so

212
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:35,639
things correctly given some evidence so given the measurements would say at

213
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,549
given the measurements would say at different times you may be interested at

214
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:40,829
different times you may be interested at this time T to calculate the posterior

215
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:43,799
this time T to calculate the posterior of the state TP this is called the

216
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,769
of the state TP this is called the filtering problem maybe if we given some

217
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:48,420
filtering problem maybe if we given some instruments of the time s we want to

218
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,189
instruments of the time s we want to predict ahead the stage but prediction

219
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:56,069
predict ahead the stage but prediction problem and those movie problem is if we

220
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:59,730
problem and those movie problem is if we are using lots of data a past time T can

221
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,490
are using lots of data a past time T can we come back and calculate an estimate

222
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,949
we come back and calculate an estimate of the state together this better more

223
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:08,129
of the state together this better more smooth from these filtering posterior

224
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:10,019
smooth from these filtering posterior distribution so this is the smoking

225
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:13,410
distribution so this is the smoking problem this are one of the reasons I

226
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,769
problem this are one of the reasons I want to do this hidden Markov models and

227
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:18,780
want to do this hidden Markov models and state-space models in a little bit more

228
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,320
state-space models in a little bit more detail right is

229
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,330


230
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:27,180
performance even though they I am discussing them therefore it's a men

231
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,830
discussing them therefore it's a men there are sort of very fundamental

232
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,630
there are sort of very fundamental problems in the context of data

233
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,740
problems in the context of data simulation so any of you who works on

234
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,920
simulation so any of you who works on any sort of dynamical problems from

235
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,200
any sort of dynamical problems from fluid mechanics to weather prediction to

236
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,050
fluid mechanics to weather prediction to earthquakes to whatever the vibrations

237
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,860
earthquakes to whatever the vibrations you know this are the problems that you

238
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,110
you know this are the problems that you need to know how to address the emergent

239
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,670
need to know how to address the emergent of academic problems they have practical

240
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,200
of academic problems they have practical problems at least three you need to know

241
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,300
problems at least three you need to know if somebody asked you what is filtering

242
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,190
if somebody asked you what is filtering what's prediction with this moving and

243
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:04,410
what's prediction with this moving and this topic is self-contained in a way

244
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,120
this topic is self-contained in a way that they have been three years many

245
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,040
that they have been three years many individuals have written which one after

246
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,380
individuals have written which one after the other rediscovering things and

247
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,480
the other rediscovering things and dressing them up with nice algebra

248
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,920
dressing them up with nice algebra things that they were known in the

249
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,610
things that they were known in the forties and fifties okay but lots of us

250
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,590
forties and fifties okay but lots of us are in discovering this with new

251
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,950
are in discovering this with new techniques so there hasn't been any

252
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,920
techniques so there hasn't been any major developments for 40 years or

253
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,050
major developments for 40 years or Cassini whoops don't expect to see

254
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,460
Cassini whoops don't expect to see something new it's just the same things

255
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,740
something new it's just the same things presently different okay like today I'm

256
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,180
presently different okay like today I'm going to present this with the junction

257
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,370
going to present this with the junction 3 algorithm I don't think in any of

258
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,530
3 algorithm I don't think in any of these books they actually bring the

259
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,780
these books they actually bring the junction tree algorithm because that is

260
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,850
junction tree algorithm because that is too complicated for people who do data

261
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,110
too complicated for people who do data stimulation ok so what I want to do so

262
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,200
stimulation ok so what I want to do so viscous the amazement we need a graph

263
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,990
viscous the amazement we need a graph theoretic approach right if for example

264
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,030
theoretic approach right if for example if you want to be simplest of these

265
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,920
if you want to be simplest of these problems that I mentioned before are

266
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,310
problems that I mentioned before are very complicated and unless you somehow

267
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,140
very complicated and unless you somehow use conditional independence relations

268
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,450
use conditional independence relations implied by the graph and an easy way to

269
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,150
implied by the graph and an easy way to see how complicated calculations would

270
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,040
see how complicated calculations would be look at the calculating for example

271
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,350
be look at the calculating for example the marginal likelihood so if you want

272
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:20,070
the marginal likelihood so if you want to try to to complete parameters in the

273
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,290
to try to to complete parameters in the model like parameters see that if

274
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,810
model like parameters see that if they're in the state transition model or

275
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,970
they're in the state transition model or in the observation model effectively we

276
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,560
in the observation model effectively we have to do some sort of car

277
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,900
have to do some sort of car model evidence by playing with you know

278
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,419
model evidence by playing with you know maximizing this likelihood and that is

279
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,720
maximizing this likelihood and that is this life is within involves integration

280
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,549
this life is within involves integration over all possible values of all the

281
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:43,600
over all possible values of all the states at all times so if you have you

282
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,299
states at all times so if you have you know we have capital T steps here and

283
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,400
know we have capital T steps here and each page will take and take M values

284
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,180
each page will take and take M values mr. problem M to power T excuse me I

285
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,799
mr. problem M to power T excuse me I mean if P is 4 million and M is 100 you

286
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,659
mean if P is 4 million and M is 100 you know then just good luck

287
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:02,530
know then just good luck cannot do it but with dysgraphia lytic

288
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,180
cannot do it but with dysgraphia lytic approaches you can actually do this

289
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,890
approaches you can actually do this problem on your little PC okay and and

290
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,710
problem on your little PC okay and and we hope that you will do this you see as

291
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:20,260
we hope that you will do this you see as a former problem as well okay in in

292
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,020
a former problem as well okay in in details next well Tuesday I wanted to

293
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,020
details next well Tuesday I wanted to remind you in the context of what we're

294
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,400
remind you in the context of what we're gonna do with Junction three algorithms

295
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,690
gonna do with Junction three algorithms on how the conditional dependence

296
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,049
on how the conditional dependence relations and the definitions of the

297
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:40,659
relations and the definitions of the various interest points of interest you

298
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:45,930
various interest points of interest you can calculate for example basis given

299
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,140
can calculate for example basis given all of the data Y right this is this

300
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,000
all of the data Y right this is this nothing distribution gives you the

301
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,549
nothing distribution gives you the probability of P P so what I say

302
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:57,280
probability of P P so what I say assistance is right from time 0 to time

303
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,870
assistance is right from time 0 to time capital T so if you can travel all right

304
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:05,169
capital T so if you can travel all right if you know I'm too nice calculations

305
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:09,250
if you know I'm too nice calculations that you guys can follow but it comes

306
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,820
that you guys can follow but it comes out this is making distribution is the

307
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,190
out this is making distribution is the product of this joint distribution and

308
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,650
product of this joint distribution and the product of this conditional

309
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,600
the product of this conditional distribution divided by the marginal of

310
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,590
distribution divided by the marginal of Y so this tradition is is the

311
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:28,450
Y so this tradition is is the probability of observing y0 y1 wealthy a

312
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,770
probability of observing y0 y1 wealthy a number of safety 3 right and what is

313
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,490
number of safety 3 right and what is nice

314
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,190
nice this is holding a pee-pee observing when

315
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,780
this is holding a pee-pee observing when I pick this one away people are still

316
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:43,270
I pick this one away people are still like fidelity okay in the note that I'm

317
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,950
like fidelity okay in the note that I'm concerned I have not finished them yet

318
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,250
concerned I have not finished them yet though for its immense that meant them

319
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:54,270
though for its immense that meant them 200 something pages in in some groups

320
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:59,950
200 something pages in in some groups this service is called at least today

321
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,650
this service is called at least today when the Condors the Alpha mastered and

322
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,260
when the Condors the Alpha mastered and this world economy domestics and you

323
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,360
this world economy domestics and you will see why I call it out from it

324
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,420
will see why I call it out from it alphas we call it on for change the

325
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,850
alphas we call it on for change the forward message right and bit enough

326
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,500
forward message right and bit enough with message from Bella convinced you

327
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,900
with message from Bella convinced you that this is really requires a forward

328
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,140
that this is really requires a forward calculation or update as we move forward

329
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,800
calculation or update as we move forward in India hmm and this required backward

330
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,140
in India hmm and this required backward calculations so anyways when I wanted to

331
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,540
calculations so anyways when I wanted to say the definition of alpha in other

332
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,600
say the definition of alpha in other books rather than being given by this

333
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,360
books rather than being given by this Joint Distribution is really the

334
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,890
Joint Distribution is really the posterior of QT given y 0 to Y T so

335
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,770
posterior of QT given y 0 to Y T so silly the tutoring distribution it

336
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,230
silly the tutoring distribution it doesn't really at the end of the day you

337
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,240
doesn't really at the end of the day you will notice any book reviews or any

338
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,760
will notice any book reviews or any papers you refer when they complete this

339
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,250
papers you refer when they complete this a lot of times necessary not equal they

340
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,430
a lot of times necessary not equal they seek proportional right so whatever the

341
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,710
seek proportional right so whatever the clinician you use for this if it is

342
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,570
clinician you use for this if it is equal to i4 proportional to alpha you

343
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,640
equal to i4 proportional to alpha you get the same equation so that should not

344
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,560
get the same equation so that should not be an issue so let me give you let me

345
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,470
be an issue so let me give you let me give you B a question that we will

346
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,070
give you B a question that we will probably sort of see next week when we

347
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,800
probably sort of see next week when we discuss about hidden Markov models this

348
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,270
discuss about hidden Markov models this is the plate for this - quantity ok the

349
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,730
is the plate for this - quantity ok the Alpha message so the calculator time T

350
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,480
Alpha message so the calculator time T plus 1 alpha you require to know Alfred

351
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,320
plus 1 alpha you require to know Alfred time QT and so you know this is

352
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,300
time QT and so you know this is basically a forward recursive

353
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,210
basically a forward recursive calculation so you start from time 0 you

354
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,520
calculation so you start from time 0 you can calculate the master time t1 and

355
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,200
can calculate the master time t1 and and you can keep going so this is

356
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,860
and you can keep going so this is exactly like we have seen for change the

357
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,860
exactly like we have seen for change the difference of postulate for change we

358
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,350
difference of postulate for change we didn't have an observation model we only

359
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,500
didn't have an observation model we only had a transition model but you know what

360
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,900
had a transition model but you know what if you actually take this and you don't

361
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,900
if you actually take this and you don't be together with this in principle you

362
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,930
be together with this in principle you get the same equation as for change and

363
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,840
get the same equation as for change and some words actually we don't want to

364
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,780
some words actually we don't want to treat this as a new problem they merge

365
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,810
treat this as a new problem they merge the evolution equations the dynamics to

366
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,850
the evolution equations the dynamics to the observation model so they can

367
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,290
the observation model so they can recycle the questions that use for

368
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,080
recycle the questions that use for checks but sort of here it's nicely

369
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,550
checks but sort of here it's nicely written okay because you explicitly see

370
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:25,370
written okay because you explicitly see the the observation model and and also

371
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,680
the the observation model and and also of this transition probabilities from

372
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,890
of this transition probabilities from state T to T plus 1 okay so this is the

373
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,290
state T to T plus 1 okay so this is the forward recursive equation for finding

374
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,560
forward recursive equation for finding alpha this is now the beta messes it

375
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,570
alpha this is now the beta messes it comes to look like that and you notice

376
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,030
comes to look like that and you notice the calculated because QT we need not be

377
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,400
the calculated because QT we need not be the QT plus one so this is a bad word

378
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,690
the QT plus one so this is a bad word equation and when you have made often

379
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,210
equation and when you have made often bit at a given time by using that both

380
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,570
bit at a given time by using that both forward and backward messages

381
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,520
forward and backward messages effectively you can calculate this

382
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,460
effectively you can calculate this moving distribution of QT given all the

383
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,200
moving distribution of QT given all the data from y 0 to Y T by multiplying the

384
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,900
data from y 0 to Y T by multiplying the messages that arrived from left and

385
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,530
messages that arrived from left and right at up to know the time T the

386
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,960
right at up to know the time T the aluminum we did message-passing having a

387
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,440
aluminum we did message-passing having a 5 marginal right you take the messages

388
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,030
5 marginal right you take the messages that arrive in unknown and you multiply

389
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,270
that arrive in unknown and you multiply them so it's not surprising that shear

390
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:27,230
them so it's not surprising that shear so we get the same relation so this you

391
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,510
so we get the same relation so this you know there is no Junction Ravens no

392
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,440
know there is no Junction Ravens no nothing you can derive this you know

393
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,290
nothing you can derive this you know using conditional dependence relation so

394
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,300
using conditional dependence relation so everything you just can deriving the

395
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,930
everything you just can deriving the pantograph

396
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:43,430
pantograph so next week we will formally derive

397
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,980
so next week we will formally derive this using message passing algorithm

398
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,790
this using message passing algorithm sand

399
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,260
sand and the fact of the office and things

400
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,660
and the fact of the office and things like that but today I want to go rather

401
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,390
like that but today I want to go rather extreme and try to somehow we derive

402
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,250
extreme and try to somehow we derive this with the junction 3 algorithm so we

403
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,990
this with the junction 3 algorithm so we can just live the junction tree

404
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:02,510
can just live the junction tree algorithm behind us ok because it's you

405
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,850
algorithm behind us ok because it's you know it's a complicated topic it's it's

406
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,380
know it's a complicated topic it's it's much better to have it to cover it

407
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,950
much better to have it to cover it earlier on today I'm going to give you

408
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,050
earlier on today I'm going to give you another block force algorithm that

409
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:18,170
another block force algorithm that somehow if you don't see often in in you

410
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,470
somehow if you don't see often in in you know in references but we will see

411
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,970
know in references but we will see somehow that it's natural backwards

412
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,580
somehow that it's natural backwards approach basically to whole period

413
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,380
approach basically to whole period actually done the beta messages and

414
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,120
actually done the beta messages and these are what we call the dominant

415
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:39,800
these are what we call the dominant cities so there are no messages so this

416
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,210
cities so there are no messages so this is the probability of QT given all the

417
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,250
is the probability of QT given all the data y0 y1 to write it ok so hopefully I

418
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:56,660
data y0 y1 to write it ok so hopefully I wrote this correctly right ok so now I

419
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,620
wrote this correctly right ok so now I need to know why is this a backwards

420
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,590
need to know why is this a backwards message well if you do the algebra right

421
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,210
message well if you do the algebra right and nothing else for conditional

422
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,920
and nothing else for conditional independence relations you can see that

423
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,010
independence relations you can see that this one of grammar sweetie don't their

424
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,470
this one of grammar sweetie don't their attention to the denominator is really a

425
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,710
attention to the denominator is really a normalizing factor but it involves the

426
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,200
normalizing factor but it involves the family it involves the calculation of

427
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,020
family it involves the calculation of the Alpha message which remember it's

428
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,030
the Alpha message which remember it's for good but involves function of

429
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,730
for good but involves function of anomalous is that this computer time T

430
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,960
anomalous is that this computer time T plus 1 so to be able to calculate gamma

431
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,620
plus 1 so to be able to calculate gamma time DT at time T you need start

432
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,780
time DT at time T you need start backwards from the end of the chain but

433
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,520
backwards from the end of the chain but you need also to do the first

434
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,830
you need also to do the first development step to calculate the Alpha

435
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,950
development step to calculate the Alpha message right so you work forward you

436
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,290
message right so you work forward you finish with the Alpha relation and then

437
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,450
finish with the Alpha relation and then once you have those you can start going

438
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,330
once you have those you can start going backwards starting with the gamut

439
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:55,610
backwards starting with the gamut to capital P and then keep updating this

440
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,210
to capital P and then keep updating this as you go backwards okay and there is a

441
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:03,320
as you go backwards okay and there is a boundary condition of course at time

442
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,890
boundary condition of course at time capital T so you can so this works okay

443
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:13,370
capital T so you can so this works okay and don't need to give you this so let's

444
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,299
and don't need to give you this so let's look at the junction tree in exactly

445
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:18,830
look at the junction tree in exactly what the junction tree algorithm is

446
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:26,240
what the junction tree algorithm is going to do for us

447
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,250


448
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:33,590
remember in the junction tree we have to put we have to find the maximal cliques

449
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:37,090
put we have to find the maximal cliques and you notice here the maximal cliques

450
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:40,940
and you notice here the maximal cliques involve to knowledge others that click

451
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,649
involve to knowledge others that click here to see what you want you want you

452
00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:45,499
here to see what you want you want you to etcetera this I have this clicks so

453
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:48,379
to etcetera this I have this clicks so this potential while chopping the

454
00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:50,779
this potential while chopping the potential subside q1 q2 is the

455
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:52,909
potential subside q1 q2 is the probability of T 2 given Q on this the

456
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:55,850
probability of T 2 given Q on this the probability of q1 given to 0 these are

457
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,549
probability of q1 given to 0 these are my transition probabilities this is high

458
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:02,960
my transition probabilities this is high potentials across the tain and then we

459
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,779
potentials across the tain and then we have the observation clicks that involve

460
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:08,570
have the observation clicks that involve Q 1 y 1 y 2 y 2 and this will be

461
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,499
Q 1 y 1 y 2 y 2 and this will be observation clicks alright so this for

462
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:14,659
observation clicks alright so this for example is the probability of y 1 given

463
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:18,320
example is the probability of y 1 given 2 our probability of Y 2 given T 2 etc

464
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,159
2 our probability of Y 2 given T 2 etc and we take this up to time capital T in

465
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,810
and we take this up to time capital T in a suppose at time 0 you want because you

466
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,629
a suppose at time 0 you want because you want to make this a 3 right so we can

467
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:32,869
want to make this a 3 right so we can define this to be the probability of to

468
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:35,899
define this to be the probability of to 0 times the observation of y 0 given to

469
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:40,879
0 times the observation of y 0 given to 0 so really this is the Joint

470
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:44,200
0 so really this is the Joint Distribution of Q 0 y 0 you see that I

471
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,330
Distribution of Q 0 y 0 you see that I mean a time 0 right I'm gonna have I'm

472
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,970
mean a time 0 right I'm gonna have I'm going to start I'm going to sample to 0

473
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,659
going to start I'm going to sample to 0 from the initial distribution P of Q 0

474
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:56,360
from the initial distribution P of Q 0 and then given to 0 then I'm going to

475
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,759
and then given to 0 then I'm going to say what's the probability of y 0 given

476
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,590
say what's the probability of y 0 given to 0 so I put the two things together

477
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:04,820
to 0 so I put the two things together and I define them as this potential okay

478
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,240
and I define them as this potential okay just to make things easy so my junction

479
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,629
just to make things easy so my junction 3 loops I gotten and what you also see

480
00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:14,450
3 loops I gotten and what you also see is the separators that you can see here

481
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,960
is the separators that you can see here these two nodes and one thing in common

482
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,940
these two nodes and one thing in common which is to 0 these two knowledge get

483
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,580
which is to 0 these two knowledge get one thing in common which is Q 1 so I

484
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,350
one thing in common which is Q 1 so I give different a lots of Greek symbols

485
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,170
give different a lots of Greek symbols here if you can pronounce them from

486
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,660
here if you can pronounce them from you're gonna get an extra bonus point in

487
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:35,050
you're gonna get an extra bonus point in your homework by Subic okay so this is

488
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:44,810
your homework by Subic okay so this is again Q to P of Q on etcetera

489
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:44,820


490
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:53,420
so so we introduce this right through this potentials are these transition

491
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,360
this potentials are these transition probabilities these are the observation

492
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,060
probabilities these are the observation models all right so we initialize all

493
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,490
models all right so we initialize all the potentials to one right so we start

494
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,770
the potentials to one right so we start we put every potential to be called

495
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,110
we put every potential to be called every separator to be the potential

496
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:11,990
every separator to be the potential survives be equal to 1 I have to wait to

497
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,540
survives be equal to 1 I have to wait to know what its life has right but don't

498
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,450
know what its life has right but don't read this and we will explain this

499
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:26,090
read this and we will explain this graphically ok ok

500
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:30,770
graphically ok ok from the clique 50 YP so maybe from this

501
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:36,830
from the clique 50 YP so maybe from this click here to - ok

502
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,920
click here to - ok again we are getting the same messages

503
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,060
again we are getting the same messages from this clicked up to this trick so

504
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,460
from this clicked up to this trick so remember when you services are right you

505
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,440
remember when you services are right you are going to have to update the

506
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,240
are going to have to update the separator and then once you have take

507
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,120
separator and then once you have take the separator then you have to abate the

508
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:58,700
the separator then you have to abate the potential side to one key to the

509
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,560
potential side to one key to the election but right now I'm going to take

510
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,310
election but right now I'm going to take messages propagating from here up all

511
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,330
messages propagating from here up all the way so from side petrol right to

512
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,760
the way so from side petrol right to subside - auntie - alright can you tell

513
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,250
subside - auntie - alright can you tell me traumatically right so we don't need

514
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:17,630
me traumatically right so we don't need the questions based on the junction tree

515
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,540
the questions based on the junction tree algorithm so we start with one what is

516
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,310
algorithm so we start with one what is the new separator potential which is a

517
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:26,480
the new separator potential which is a function of t2

518
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:26,490


519
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,980
I see something on the computers like that you know it was like and I went to

520
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,330
that you know it was like and I went to some high place they don't like myself

521
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,509
some high place they don't like myself cup you know right so must be something

522
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:39,070
cup you know right so must be something like that everything is in the computer

523
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,700
like that everything is in the computer all right so that's why I'm not gonna be

524
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,680
all right so that's why I'm not gonna be posting anything anymore you know it's

525
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,889
posting anything anymore you know it's too tiring try this blood so what is

526
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:55,879
too tiring try this blood so what is that benefit separate the potential you

527
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:57,799
that benefit separate the potential you remember to find the updated potential

528
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:59,739
remember to find the updated potential maybe we have to do this potential here

529
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:02,330
maybe we have to do this potential here we have integrated with respect to what

530
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:26,019
we have integrated with respect to what variable at this point okay okay because

531
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:30,230
variable at this point okay okay because clearly with exactly the junction tree

532
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,519
clearly with exactly the junction tree algorithm knows best

533
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,039
algorithm knows best so we don't otherwise right so you tell

534
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,690
so we don't otherwise right so you tell me when I integrate this with respect to

535
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,060
me when I integrate this with respect to Y to change the relative and tell me

536
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:44,370
Y to change the relative and tell me what that will give you

537
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:44,380


538
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,180
so when I integrate this potential we discover this potential is to respect to

539
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,289
discover this potential is to respect to Y 2

540
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:55,380
Y 2 what will the Z star be what is this

541
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:08,280
what will the Z star be what is this potential

542
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,290


543
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:11,990
you have to think again our original problem right

544
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:17,730
problem right what is that potential here here I can

545
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:26,370
what is that potential here here I can say is it's the king of you so when you

546
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,930
say is it's the king of you so when you named the greatest returns with respect

547
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,180
named the greatest returns with respect to what bhari maang

548
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,040
to what bhari maang we said why son I'll observe right now

549
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:38,040
we said why son I'll observe right now so with respect to how much is that so

550
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,100
so with respect to how much is that so the separation potential then will not

551
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:47,310
the separation potential then will not change all right how about this

552
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:50,100
change all right how about this potential here so the message now from

553
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,960
potential here so the message now from the superlative was in there

554
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,760
the superlative was in there so we have made this form of this

555
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,920
so we have made this form of this potential will be there is a potential

556
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,290
potential will be there is a potential times we have delegates of electric

557
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,550
times we have delegates of electric potential divided by the original

558
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,330
potential divided by the original potential separator potential which is

559
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:06,000
potential separator potential which is relative motion so this potential we

560
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,410
relative motion so this potential we should not say so when messages with

561
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,750
should not say so when messages with wise being an observed when messages are

562
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:17,760
wise being an observed when messages are sent from this critics upwards the this

563
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,580
sent from this critics upwards the this potential sigh of q0 q1 q1 q2 etc do not

564
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,370
potential sigh of q0 q1 q1 q2 etc do not change so the junction tree algorithm

565
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:31,410
change so the junction tree algorithm does nothing ok all right so let's see

566
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,250
does nothing ok all right so let's see [Applause]

567
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,750
[Applause] so now let's do the following thing

568
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:43,740
so now let's do the following thing let's send messages from from k0 y 0 to

569
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:52,740
let's send messages from from k0 y 0 to p 0 qm messages hmm so we're going to

570
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,600
p 0 qm messages hmm so we're going to send messages from here to there from

571
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,700
send messages from here to there from there to there and of course from here

572
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,320
there to there and of course from here to there so if this message what is so

573
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,450
to there so if this message what is so best to make is going to send messages

574
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,150
best to make is going to send messages to this plea can you tell me what is the

575
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,010
to this plea can you tell me what is the objective value is going to be of P star

576
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,600
objective value is going to be of P star to 0

577
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:11,610


578
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:17,250
using the main idea of the algorithm start to calculate the new value fish

579
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,399
start to calculate the new value fish this time to zero what do we have to do

580
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,389
this time to zero what do we have to do to this potential interview with respect

581
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:32,040
to this potential interview with respect my body my body will do zero so remember

582
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,530
my body my body will do zero so remember this potential he had told me it was the

583
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,070
this potential he had told me it was the joint distribution of Q zero Y zero

584
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:41,100
joint distribution of Q zero Y zero remember because it included the it

585
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:46,500
remember because it included the it included the prior of K 0 and also the

586
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,230
included the prior of K 0 and also the observation of y 0 into 0 since we know

587
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:54,119
observation of y 0 into 0 since we know joint okay Broadway so the reason

588
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,680
joint okay Broadway so the reason potentially with the joint circle

589
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,740
potentially with the joint circle integrative respect to y 0 you get P of

590
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,070
integrative respect to y 0 you get P of Q 0 so immediately you can see that this

591
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:06,060
Q 0 so immediately you can see that this peak potential becomes a marginal so

592
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,670
peak potential becomes a marginal so suddenly has a meaning it's nothing else

593
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:15,540
suddenly has a meaning it's nothing else but the marginal of to 0 so let's see

594
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,420
but the marginal of to 0 so let's see what's going to happen the prop dated we

595
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,780
what's going to happen the prop dated we will take the or potential which is the

596
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,090
will take the or potential which is the probability you are given to 0 and this

597
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,070
probability you are given to 0 and this we told is the marginal so this this

598
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:30,090
we told is the marginal so this this product is the joint of proceeding QR so

599
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,380
product is the joint of proceeding QR so the clinic potentials now become

600
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,940
the clinic potentials now become marginal social so maybe I should call

601
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,890
marginal social so maybe I should call this potential now becomes 2 marginally

602
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:48,780
this potential now becomes 2 marginally maybe this becomes a remember when we

603
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,640
maybe this becomes a remember when we said that the joint probability

604
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,359
said that the joint probability distribution is the product of the

605
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,250
distribution is the product of the maximal clique potentials divided by the

606
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,099
maximal clique potentials divided by the separators can you actually visualize

607
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:02,400
separators can you actually visualize now about what because it first becomes

608
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,950
now about what because it first becomes this marginal so the other one to become

609
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:09,380
this marginal so the other one to become the submariners maybe that works really

610
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,859
the submariners maybe that works really okay and you can guys do the algebra and

611
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:19,620
okay and you can guys do the algebra and you can see that which works fine

612
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:19,630


613
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:26,650
so when you send message from here to there alright and and from there to

614
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,940
there alright and and from there to there okay

615
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,330
there okay well this becomes this marginal and I

616
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:34,080
well this becomes this marginal and I remind you the message from here upwards

617
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,420
remind you the message from here upwards does not fit so now what we will need to

618
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,050
does not fit so now what we will need to do is we will need to send the message

619
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:45,670
do is we will need to send the message from here down to the click Q 1 yr so

620
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,990
from here down to the click Q 1 yr so you have to tell me what is the new

621
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,760
you have to tell me what is the new variant does it understand of going to

622
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,950
variant does it understand of going to be sure it is the degree of this no

623
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,370
be sure it is the degree of this no potential when the message comes from

624
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,650
potential when the message comes from here and it's going down so how do I

625
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,810
here and it's going down so how do I calculate this staff does it ever stop

626
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,870
calculate this staff does it ever stop now

627
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:11,940
now [Music]

628
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:11,950


629
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:24,070
with respect and tell me that this potential list is P of Q 0 Q 1 so 0 0 of

630
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:29,800
potential list is P of Q 0 Q 1 so 0 0 of acumen becomes what becomes a 0 now do

631
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,480
acumen becomes what becomes a 0 now do you say becomes P of pure refers to this

632
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:41,170
you say becomes P of pure refers to this potential originally because you never

633
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,020
potential originally because you never changed what if you reverse the

634
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,530
changed what if you reverse the probability of y 1 given Q 1 x now the

635
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,570
probability of y 1 given Q 1 x now the new potential Z that will start and we

636
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:53,349
new potential Z that will start and we told me was what B if you are divided by

637
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:56,620
told me was what B if you are divided by 1 so the new potential is going to be

638
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,980
1 so the new potential is going to be what now

639
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:00,990


640
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:07,430
so easily it was pure white women q1 and then you multiplied by P a few ones so

641
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:14,920
then you multiplied by P a few ones so that gives you a circle of why you want

642
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,900
that gives you a circle of why you want so you can see now that even this you

643
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,099
so you can see now that even this you know potentials also become marginal so

644
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:26,780
know potentials also become marginal so happy the only the peak potentials

645
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,220
happy the only the peak potentials become arsenals and then effectively the

646
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,320
become arsenals and then effectively the separators becomes her marginal or even

647
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,570
separators becomes her marginal or even you may say what's going on where is the

648
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,609
you may say what's going on where is the other message where's the bigger message

649
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:41,620
other message where's the bigger message I'm confused right so okay so let's see

650
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:46,220
I'm confused right so okay so let's see so this is just a schematic again of the

651
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,349
so this is just a schematic again of the what the other if like we presented

652
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:51,589
what the other if like we presented right so we start sending messages from

653
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:53,810
right so we start sending messages from these clips by just completing the

654
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,960
these clips by just completing the separators all right and then using this

655
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,050
separators all right and then using this product which we've updated separator

656
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,970
product which we've updated separator potential divided by the originals we

657
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,940
potential divided by the originals we update this Creek potential and the only

658
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,220
update this Creek potential and the only difference on this schematic from what

659
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,589
difference on this schematic from what we had before here this node has

660
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:11,270
we had before here this node has multiple children so we have taken

661
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:14,030
multiple children so we have taken further the same way we do with message

662
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:18,290
further the same way we do with message passing and then on the reverse step we

663
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,970
passing and then on the reverse step we distribute the information from this

664
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,250
distribute the information from this node to the children so we applied the

665
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,400
node to the children so we applied the separators alright so we calculate the

666
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,140
separators alright so we calculate the separators the way we did before and

667
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,560
separators the way we did before and then we multiplied with the double style

668
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,540
then we multiplied with the double style which we trying to update the potentials

669
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:40,180
which we trying to update the potentials of this now right that's what we did

670
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:40,190


671
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:51,090
okay

672
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:51,100


673
00:39:51,100 --> 00:41:03,070
you know right so think of this so this can be represented as a well-defined

674
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:08,680
can be represented as a well-defined table okay so the difference because

675
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,040
table okay so the difference because this y star given is I am going to take

676
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,540
this y star given is I am going to take these two positive potentials to be the

677
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,060
these two positive potentials to be the conditional of YT given 50 so if I look

678
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,700
conditional of YT given 50 so if I look here I'm going to fake this to start

679
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,460
here I'm going to fake this to start with that is the condition of y2 given Q

680
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:33,400
with that is the condition of y2 given Q - okay in case you know you know you can

681
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,770
- okay in case you know you know you can come up to this you know with

682
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,470
come up to this you know with forgiveness but let's say I am going to

683
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:41,380
forgiveness but let's say I am going to use the separator potential to be the

684
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,520
use the separator potential to be the probability of YJ given kitty

685
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,900
probability of YJ given kitty fortunately what happens to the alpha

686
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,230
fortunately what happens to the alpha messages to the bigger messages etc

687
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:53,140
messages to the bigger messages etc let's figure out investors that is

688
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:57,250
let's figure out investors that is propagating in this case flow from here

689
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:02,230
propagating in this case flow from here to this click alright and then down

690
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:06,910
to this click alright and then down there so how to update using the

691
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,010
there so how to update using the junction tree algorithm this joint

692
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,940
junction tree algorithm this joint potential of 50 and 50 plus one

693
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,980
potential of 50 and 50 plus one so remember messages are going to be

694
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,660
so remember messages are going to be coming from this separator and they're

695
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,520
coming from this separator and they're gonna be coming from this separator and

696
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,490
gonna be coming from this separator and we are actually start with that this

697
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,170
we are actually start with that this message is coming from the separators

698
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:27,730
message is coming from the separators have no all right because my name is

699
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:30,010
have no all right because my name is Raquel should be so we have to start you

700
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,200
Raquel should be so we have to start you know with this messages from the leeches

701
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,540
know with this messages from the leeches let's say that they're known and we want

702
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,030
let's say that they're known and we want to update this potential emotion we want

703
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:40,050
to update this potential emotion we want to update this operator potential there

704
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,109
to update this operator potential there so this operator sends a message and we

705
00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:46,240
so this operator sends a message and we want to see how this potential changes

706
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,000
want to see how this potential changes so look at this equation the first line

707
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,850
so look at this equation the first line and told me it could be the junction to

708
00:42:51,850 --> 00:43:02,710
and told me it could be the junction to algorithm members mistake

709
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:02,720


710
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:09,130
what we're supposed to be the new potential of this potential the new

711
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,040
potential of this potential the new potential supposed to be the new

712
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,200
potential supposed to be the new potential which is this times the

713
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,100
potential which is this times the product of the Feist and demanded money

714
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,690
product of the Feist and demanded money originally we and the original three

715
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:24,150
originally we and the original three senses we take them equal to 1 so the

716
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,860
senses we take them equal to 1 so the show the product here will be of this

717
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,190
show the product here will be of this part of QT and the product of this part

718
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,920
part of QT and the product of this part of QT plus 1 and I told you that there

719
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,770
of QT plus 1 and I told you that there takes the start of KP plus 1 to make the

720
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:38,440
takes the start of KP plus 1 to make the probability of YT plus 1 given QT plus 1

721
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,780
probability of YT plus 1 given QT plus 1 so basically the only thing that I am

722
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,870
so basically the only thing that I am this here that doesn't literally divide

723
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:47,470
this here that doesn't literally divide right something from the separated

724
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:51,520
right something from the separated potential from k plus 1 ways by

725
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:56,470
potential from k plus 1 ways by marginalizing this potential because

726
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:01,180
marginalizing this potential because this click potential the members is not

727
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,310
this click potential the members is not a distribution as environment variables

728
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:08,230
a distribution as environment variables because we always observed so in

729
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:12,130
because we always observed so in principle I am using this by calculating

730
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:14,290
principle I am using this by calculating from the case that we had before where

731
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:21,370
from the case that we had before where this thing was the new potential child

732
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:25,930
this thing was the new potential child is the or potential times P star times

733
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:29,950
is the or potential times P star times the separator potential Z star so this

734
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,930
the separator potential Z star so this is my transition model this is this

735
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,760
is my transition model this is this power of U star and this is my

736
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,010
power of U star and this is my observation model and let's calculate

737
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:40,060
observation model and let's calculate now so this is the new update can give

738
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,400
now so this is the new update can give in a question to calculate this time 50

739
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,430
in a question to calculate this time 50 plus 1 what would be so we were moving

740
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,740
plus 1 what would be so we were moving forward on the chain what will be the

741
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,680
forward on the chain what will be the new simulator potential fist R of Q T

742
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,400
new simulator potential fist R of Q T plus 1

743
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,720
plus 1 what's my definition of calculating you

744
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,750
what's my definition of calculating you know the forward a page of them of the

745
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,420
know the forward a page of them of the separator potential when we need to come

746
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,730
separator potential when we need to come to do to calculate this kind of TP plus

747
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:13,910
to do to calculate this kind of TP plus one we need to start with what potential

748
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:13,920


749
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,400
remember the crystals are calculated if we have strictly potential and the

750
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,860
we have strictly potential and the message propagate right to the separator

751
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,470
message propagate right to the separator we technically potential finally the way

752
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:27,140
we technically potential finally the way the various materials from the separator

753
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,510
the various materials from the separator so that potential do you take we take

754
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:32,270
so that potential do you take we take the Tristar QT QT plus 1 that was just a

755
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:38,570
the Tristar QT QT plus 1 that was just a blanket this is the potential we just

756
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,310
blanket this is the potential we just have a few things here so we're going to

757
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,530
have a few things here so we're going to take this and we're going to integrate

758
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:47,630
take this and we're going to integrate what kind of allowed completely all

759
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:50,570
what kind of allowed completely all right so to define crystal 50 plus 1

760
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:53,450
right so to define crystal 50 plus 1 we're going to have this size star of QT

761
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,180
we're going to have this size star of QT QT plus 1 which is this expression from

762
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,100
QT plus 1 which is this expression from the slide before and we're going to

763
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,860
the slide before and we're going to integrate this with QT if you convinced

764
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:03,110
integrate this with QT if you convinced you know what the Alpha mess is at 50

765
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:04,940
you know what the Alpha mess is at 50 plus 1 and this is the Alpha messed up

766
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,960
plus 1 and this is the Alpha messed up UT this equation is identical the

767
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,910
UT this equation is identical the equation that you derived with the

768
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,500
equation that you derived with the conditional independence relations that

769
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,310
conditional independence relations that I gave you earlier

770
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,800
I gave you earlier so the junction tree hug with basically

771
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,730
so the junction tree hug with basically discovered a well-known recursive

772
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:22,330
discovered a well-known recursive equation for updating the correlations

773
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:27,060
equation for updating the correlations okay

774
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:27,070


775
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:31,710
and it is sort of a very nice I mean to me that's the best example to

776
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:33,000
me that's the best example to demonstrate how the junction tree

777
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,750
demonstrate how the junction tree algorithm works because it gives you an

778
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,360
algorithm works because it gives you an answer that

779
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,190
answer that you know it is not obvious but you will

780
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,010
you know it is not obvious but you will get it but you know but if you don't

781
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,510
get it but you know but if you don't have it you know that there's a problem

782
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:50,820
have it you know that there's a problem so this is a welcome basically proof of

783
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,850
so this is a welcome basically proof of consistency and the working ability of

784
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,340
consistency and the working ability of the or reduction tree algorithm ok so

785
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,400
the or reduction tree algorithm ok so this is the alpha message and so when

786
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,890
this is the alpha message and so when you propagate the message is all the way

787
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:08,610
you propagate the message is all the way to the you know to the location you vote

788
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,140
to the you know to the location you vote from the leaves all the way to the root

789
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,890
from the leaves all the way to the root at the end of the day if you calculate

790
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:18,140
at the end of the day if you calculate the updated the final updating potential

791
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:21,990
the updated the final updating potential your sandwich here the size part of Q

792
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:25,500
your sandwich here the size part of Q capital P and Q capital t minus 1 all

793
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,510
capital P and Q capital t minus 1 all right this is I am using the equation we

794
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:30,270
right this is I am using the equation we had on the previous slide when I apply

795
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:33,900
had on the previous slide when I apply this to the root effectively you can

796
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,730
this to the root effectively you can show that this gives you the joint

797
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:39,690
show that this gives you the joint distribution of y 0 to y capital T and

798
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:43,380
distribution of y 0 to y capital T and QT minus 1 to P P so actually when you

799
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,690
QT minus 1 to P P so actually when you integrate these two variables out on

800
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:48,690
integrate these two variables out on this final update of size star you can

801
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,910
this final update of size star you can get the marginal aptitude with a forward

802
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,850
get the marginal aptitude with a forward calculation ok

803
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:56,670
calculation ok so effectively the calculation of the

804
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:59,640
so effectively the calculation of the marginal likelihood from the calculation

805
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:04,470
marginal likelihood from the calculation that takes them to apparent complexity

806
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:06,120
that takes them to apparent complexity now it becomes something much easier

807
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,000
now it becomes something much easier because you only have to integrate two

808
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,820
because you only have to integrate two variables with the assumption of course

809
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:14,010
variables with the assumption of course that this alpha messages can be computed

810
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:14,790
that this alpha messages can be computed recursively

811
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:17,070
recursively from this equation at which appear

812
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,350
from this equation at which appear that's basically you know there are

813
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,990
that's basically you know there are multiplications here of this K by K

814
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:25,760
multiplications here of this K by K matrix with a k-dimensional vector so

815
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,340
matrix with a k-dimensional vector so the complexity of this is balance of all

816
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,690
the complexity of this is balance of all basically right

817
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,440
basically right you know it's not too complicated so

818
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:39,490
you know it's not too complicated so this correlation was not going backwards

819
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:43,630
this correlation was not going backwards can somebody help me to say when we get

820
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,380
can somebody help me to say when we get the beta messages or we get this wheel

821
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,390
the beta messages or we get this wheel dominus disease but usually you don't

822
00:48:49,390 --> 00:49:08,700
dominus disease but usually you don't see them when you talk about

823
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:08,710


824
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:33,910
okay because so we need to point t double star of kitty can you help me on

825
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:40,720
double star of kitty can you help me on how the population may look like just so

826
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,510
how the population may look like just so you know remember to update you know if

827
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:44,950
you know remember to update you know if you have this separate the right and

828
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:47,530
you have this separate the right and strength semesters right so the

829
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,780
strength semesters right so the potentials basically would be the

830
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:54,670
potentials basically would be the original potentials x divided by T star

831
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:57,730
original potentials x divided by T star all right and then when you integrate

832
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:00,730
all right and then when you integrate everything out apparently actually from

833
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:03,280
everything out apparently actually from this message that comes from below when

834
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,900
this message that comes from below when you integrate out to tea you'll be able

835
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,680
you integrate out to tea you'll be able to get switched double style 50 so what

836
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:13,130
to get switched double style 50 so what should I write

837
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:13,140


838
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:17,460
in anticipation does this we agree on this

839
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,330
this the psystar novel style of QT QT + 1 is

840
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:23,460
the psystar novel style of QT QT + 1 is the previous potential knowledge P

841
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:27,540
the previous potential knowledge P double star divided by Q prime what

842
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,660
double star divided by Q prime what happened to the previous model no there

843
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:34,830
happened to the previous model no there is a picture here okay so so look at

844
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:36,960
is a picture here okay so so look at this equation is this the next sensor

845
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,150
this equation is this the next sensor you do a papist

846
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:41,670
you do a papist I think the on potential I multiplied

847
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:48,060
I think the on potential I multiplied with the double star and I'm going to do

848
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,830
with the double star and I'm going to do my starting from them until I won't find

849
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:52,710
my starting from them until I won't find that recursive relation for this divided

850
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:55,290
that recursive relation for this divided by the original message 3 star which was

851
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:56,849
by the original message 3 star which was my initial message we've never from the

852
00:50:56,849 --> 00:51:03,210
my initial message we've never from the forward algorithm all right so this is

853
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:09,630
forward algorithm all right so this is the potential okay now how do we get all

854
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:09,840
the potential okay now how do we get all right

855
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:14,250
right so how do we get feedback we start with

856
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:18,140
so how do we get feedback we start with kitty

857
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:18,150


858
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:28,559
so what is dissipation tell you what

859
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:28,569


860
00:51:28,569 --> 00:51:34,949
basically what I do is I take I stop all right because from what I say this is

861
00:51:34,949 --> 00:51:37,499
right because from what I say this is try start or a freestyle times P double

862
00:51:37,499 --> 00:51:39,839
try start or a freestyle times P double prime and then I integrate out to T plus

863
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,099
prime and then I integrate out to T plus one

864
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:43,199
one now I don't see anything coming from

865
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:50,640
now I don't see anything coming from below is that the we monitored nothing -

866
00:51:50,640 --> 00:52:02,370
below is that the we monitored nothing - from below

867
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:02,380


868
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:10,580
knowing that the equations correct seems to me nothing comes from below right

869
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,110
to me nothing comes from below right what you guys were going to be in in

870
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,040
what you guys were going to be in in terrible

871
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,740
terrible so let's assuming that nothing comes

872
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,100
so let's assuming that nothing comes from this all right so what sending

873
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,530
from this all right so what sending message is so this is actually you know

874
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:25,350
message is so this is actually you know what this is of the distributive step so

875
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,270
what this is of the distributive step so the idea here is you are going to have

876
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,800
the idea here is you are going to have this message sending you a message this

877
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,590
this message sending you a message this way and a message that way so we will

878
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:33,990
way and a message that way so we will update this we will update that but

879
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:35,250
update this we will update that but right now we're looking on the back

880
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:39,260
right now we're looking on the back wants to distribute there where this

881
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,670
wants to distribute there where this double star potential will update this

882
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:43,440
double star potential will update this will update out and then we'll update

883
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,780
will update out and then we'll update that this is the new message to double

884
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:53,970
that this is the new message to double star and if you rent it okay explicitly

885
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,190
star and if you rent it okay explicitly and you crave this will double star to

886
00:52:56,190 --> 00:53:00,060
and you crave this will double star to be a real message this equation that you

887
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,340
be a real message this equation that you get is identical to the gamma backwards

888
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,440
get is identical to the gamma backwards propagation message that you can get

889
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,380
propagation message that you can get directly with conditional independence

890
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,010
directly with conditional independence relations so the idea here is rather

891
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:12,840
relations so the idea here is rather than doing a forward step where you find

892
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,490
than doing a forward step where you find the outcome essence and apocryphal

893
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:17,520
the outcome essence and apocryphal define the beta messages you can reform

894
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,560
define the beta messages you can reform unless you define the alpha messages

895
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,320
unless you define the alpha messages change the Alpha messages and then you

896
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,630
change the Alpha messages and then you do ma quad step because we need the

897
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,760
do ma quad step because we need the alchemist is here to update the data

898
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,680
alchemist is here to update the data messages and once you have the a

899
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,480
messages and once you have the a question there are no messages you can

900
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,450
question there are no messages you can basically compute any quantity of

901
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:37,680
basically compute any quantity of interest directly so you can do the

902
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,510
interest directly so you can do the filtering you know the smoothing

903
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:41,970
filtering you know the smoothing distributions predictions

904
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:47,930
distributions predictions etc directly using this miss messages so

905
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:51,180
etc directly using this miss messages so that's how the algorithm looks basically

906
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:55,980
that's how the algorithm looks basically for Junction tree okay and while suggest

907
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,350
for Junction tree okay and while suggest us you know spend some time doing the

908
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:01,950
us you know spend some time doing the answer Rob I can't write because we made

909
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:07,340
answer Rob I can't write because we made the the a page a list

910
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:07,350


911
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:12,480
actually even closer I said we have them a nice plot this does really do anything

912
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,570
a nice plot this does really do anything you need to know alright this is the

913
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:21,930
you need to know alright this is the junction 300 okay so you collect

914
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:24,960
junction 300 okay so you collect messages from the children how do you do

915
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,260
messages from the children how do you do this marginalizing this potential

916
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,730
this marginalizing this potential eliminating all but the bottom was

917
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:33,030
eliminating all but the bottom was involved in the separators then form the

918
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,910
involved in the separators then form the product of the new separators divided by

919
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:38,100
product of the new separators divided by the old ones multiplying with the

920
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,450
the old ones multiplying with the current potential you update the

921
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:40,860
current potential you update the potential that's the phonograph step

922
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,890
potential that's the phonograph step down and if you want meant to go

923
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:46,800
down and if you want meant to go backwards and distribute information to

924
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,870
backwards and distribute information to the children effectively what you need

925
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:50,580
the children effectively what you need to do is find a new supply of

926
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,560
to do is find a new supply of pretentious integrating everything out

927
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,680
pretentious integrating everything out except the separator variables and then

928
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,480
except the separator variables and then update basically the new potentials as

929
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,230
update basically the new potentials as the old ones

930
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:02,190
the old ones times the product of the new separator

931
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:04,490
times the product of the new separator potentials this P double star divided by

932
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:07,410
potentials this P double star divided by the previous ones and the previous ones

933
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:08,760
the previous ones and the previous ones remember there would be one that you

934
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,600
remember there would be one that you computed in the forward step so you can

935
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,100
computed in the forward step so you can actually appreciate here for something

936
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:17,130
actually appreciate here for something you can say if this were the alpha

937
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:20,190
you can say if this were the alpha messages right you can see here you need

938
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,380
messages right you can see here you need to keep track of the other messages to

939
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,840
to keep track of the other messages to be able to do the distribution of

940
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:30,920
be able to do the distribution of information for fairness to the children

941
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:30,930


942
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:38,299
so this iWitness is basically as powerful as you can get with

943
00:55:38,299 --> 00:55:42,559
powerful as you can get with probabilistic graphical models and you

944
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:47,019
probabilistic graphical models and you know there are sort of different type of

945
00:55:47,019 --> 00:55:49,370
know there are sort of different type of ways of implementing this that I think

946
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:51,710
ways of implementing this that I think we highlighted on the lecture on

947
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:54,440
we highlighted on the lecture on Thursday but - what you see this is what

948
00:55:54,440 --> 00:56:00,950
Thursday but - what you see this is what you get okay and it's nice because in

949
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:03,230
you get okay and it's nice because in essence the algorithm is really doing

950
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:06,859
essence the algorithm is really doing inference on a tree but the tree is a

951
00:56:06,859 --> 00:56:12,319
inference on a tree but the tree is a tree of cliques so basically we to be

952
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,140
tree of cliques so basically we to be able to use all these ideas we transform

953
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,630
able to use all these ideas we transform the original glass right the rafter all

954
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:21,260
the original glass right the rafter all of the left--it to a junction tree which

955
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:26,480
of the left--it to a junction tree which is you know a tree basically potentials

956
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,630
is you know a tree basically potentials that are clicked and we notice when you

957
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,160
that are clicked and we notice when you implement this algorithm basically at

958
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,170
implement this algorithm basically at least with no evidence the potentials

959
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:35,720
least with no evidence the potentials come to be marginals the separators come

960
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,690
come to be marginals the separators come to be sub master what evidence is a wee

961
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:42,980
to be sub master what evidence is a wee bit more complicated than that any

962
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:46,880
bit more complicated than that any questions about the junction tree

963
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,480
questions about the junction tree algorithm you need to at least you know

964
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,760
algorithm you need to at least you know I would suggest this you know maybe take

965
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,019
I would suggest this you know maybe take you have not even you know the hmm

966
00:57:00,019 --> 00:57:05,960
you have not even you know the hmm mobile same model I only have leaves you

967
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,900
mobile same model I only have leaves you know the dynamic you know the transition

968
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,950
know the dynamic you know the transition of states and apply this and see if you

969
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:15,230
of states and apply this and see if you get you know the Alpha and the beta

970
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,930
get you know the Alpha and the beta messages exactly as we did before and

971
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:20,269
messages exactly as we did before and then of course repeat these calculations

972
00:57:20,269 --> 00:57:22,760
then of course repeat these calculations try to some propagating messages from

973
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,299
try to some propagating messages from the leaves to the rope the root path and

974
00:57:26,299 --> 00:57:29,809
the leaves to the rope the root path and take what you get and see what you get

975
00:57:29,809 --> 00:57:32,460
take what you get and see what you get is what's listed in the book

976
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:40,410
is what's listed in the book on forward and backward propagation 136

977
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:45,570
on forward and backward propagation 136 art with a lot of time but we can now

978
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,270
art with a lot of time but we can now relax

979
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:54,770
relax really and going another presentation

980
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:54,780


981
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:59,490
okay

982
00:57:59,490 --> 00:57:59,500


983
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:07,140
so I really want to you know do good backflips and discuss about the

984
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,349
backflips and discuss about the elementary thinks about Markov models

985
00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:12,870
elementary thinks about Markov models and in the process of course discussing

986
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:15,240
and in the process of course discussing the sentimental things we receive

987
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,770
the sentimental things we receive different implementations of this

988
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,780
different implementations of this forward and market messages but they

989
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,170
forward and market messages but they want the precision of this lectures as

990
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:27,390
want the precision of this lectures as part of for doing you know built a

991
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:28,950
part of for doing you know built a simulation using probabilistic graphical

992
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:31,320
simulation using probabilistic graphical models and actually some of you are

993
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:35,430
models and actually some of you are interested on on projects right you can

994
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:37,710
interested on on projects right you can see welcome to slice and start your own

995
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:40,800
see welcome to slice and start your own works then they can be lots of very

996
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,020
works then they can be lots of very complicated see the map of northern

997
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:46,740
complicated see the map of northern shore state-space models with multiple

998
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,510
shore state-space models with multiple change that they are interacting with

999
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:51,890
change that they are interacting with each other with a lot of complexity with

1000
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:55,349
each other with a lot of complexity with observation notice that there the

1001
00:58:55,349 --> 00:58:58,680
observation notice that there the likelihood mods are nonlinear so if you

1002
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,690
likelihood mods are nonlinear so if you can do lots of fancy things with it

1003
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:03,180
can do lots of fancy things with it alright so not only ambition when I try

1004
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,300
alright so not only ambition when I try to do through the very elementary things

1005
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,980
to do through the very elementary things when something will only have

1006
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,750
when something will only have discussions I'm going to bypass it but

1007
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:12,349
discussions I'm going to bypass it but you have an opportunity to to leave that

1008
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:15,510
you have an opportunity to to leave that again but when there's something in this

1009
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,750
again but when there's something in this one that we haven't seen it even if it's

1010
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,829
one that we haven't seen it even if it's trivial we would spend something

1011
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:27,430
trivial we would spend something sometime

1012
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:27,440


1013
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:33,440
all right so you may ask me why do we go this

1014
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,089
so you may ask me why do we go this backwards now to do these things you

1015
00:59:35,089 --> 00:59:37,760
backwards now to do these things you know because we have the luxury I finish

1016
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,799
know because we have the luxury I finish covering the course so now I can just

1017
00:59:39,799 --> 00:59:43,160
covering the course so now I can just have fun right that's all because if we

1018
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,049
have fun right that's all because if we go other ways and we do Junction tree

1019
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:48,500
go other ways and we do Junction tree algorithm in May then you say what is

1020
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:54,940
algorithm in May then you say what is going on here right there yeah all right

1021
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:54,950


1022
00:59:54,950 --> 01:00:06,950
maybe you should record the yes right so you can play recorder say yeah what

1023
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:09,980
you can play recorder say yeah what basically considering a collection of

1024
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:13,430
basically considering a collection of random variables for the index L in the

1025
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:18,250
random variables for the index L in the corner angle systems means time okay but

1026
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:20,240
corner angle systems means time okay but many other things where you have

1027
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,309
many other things where you have sequences of random variables has

1028
01:00:22,309 --> 01:00:25,670
sequences of random variables has nothing to do with time okay it's not in

1029
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:37,370
nothing to do with time okay it's not in the spatial location you know each other

1030
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:41,000
the spatial location you know each other so we are assuming that somehow in our

1031
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,819
so we are assuming that somehow in our model we have the cumulative

1032
01:00:43,819 --> 01:00:46,640
model we have the cumulative distribution okay and here in this place

1033
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,970
distribution okay and here in this place I'm interested on a finite joint

1034
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:51,589
I'm interested on a finite joint cumulative distribution I'm not pushing

1035
01:00:51,589 --> 01:00:54,589
cumulative distribution I'm not pushing this train basically to infinity because

1036
01:00:54,589 --> 01:00:57,950
this train basically to infinity because not they bring other issues that we

1037
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:01,670
not they bring other issues that we don't want to deal at this point so the

1038
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:04,279
don't want to deal at this point so the first quantity of interest is to define

1039
01:01:04,279 --> 01:01:08,420
first quantity of interest is to define what we call a stationary process and

1040
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:11,420
what we call a stationary process and the ability is if we already have

1041
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:14,150
the ability is if we already have defined the CDF like this a stationary

1042
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:15,829
defined the CDF like this a stationary process is the one called this joint

1043
01:01:15,829 --> 01:01:20,089
process is the one called this joint distribution is equal to this where

1044
01:01:20,089 --> 01:01:22,069
distribution is equal to this where instead of 1 I have 1 plus tau

1045
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:25,789
instead of 1 I have 1 plus tau sort of - 2 plus tau etc so basically as

1046
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:28,490
sort of - 2 plus tau etc so basically as I stretch the whole thing by tau I can

1047
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,650
I stretch the whole thing by tau I can still get the same joint cumulative

1048
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:32,829
still get the same joint cumulative distribution function

1049
01:01:32,829 --> 01:01:36,890
distribution function now the familiar model that we used in

1050
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:39,680
now the familiar model that we used in the class of now is involved about

1051
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,200
the class of now is involved about convey an assumption that tastes

1052
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,740
convey an assumption that tastes basically the probability of xn plus 1

1053
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:49,010
basically the probability of xn plus 1 depends only on the values of xn and not

1054
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:53,120
depends only on the values of xn and not on the previous values ok and many books

1055
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,950
on the previous values ok and many books have been written on this topic in the

1056
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:58,789
have been written on this topic in the context of optimistic modeling you know

1057
01:01:58,789 --> 01:02:02,779
context of optimistic modeling you know molecular simulations financial

1058
01:02:02,779 --> 01:02:06,099
molecular simulations financial engineering etc but I can tell you that

1059
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:08,569
engineering etc but I can tell you that everyone recent sort of research paper

1060
01:02:08,569 --> 01:02:10,760
everyone recent sort of research paper you sell the topic they say now this is

1061
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,750
you sell the topic they say now this is not very good ok so somehow you need to

1062
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:20,420
not very good ok so somehow you need to get rid of this assumption we get rid of

1063
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:21,289
get rid of this assumption we get rid of it for now

1064
01:02:21,289 --> 01:02:35,470
it for now ok so now we are going to basically from

1065
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:38,329
ok so now we are going to basically from natural - processing and actually you

1066
01:02:38,329 --> 01:02:40,579
natural - processing and actually you will see when you read back is book one

1067
01:02:40,579 --> 01:02:43,069
will see when you read back is book one of the things you can do is if you take

1068
01:02:43,069 --> 01:02:46,279
of the things you can do is if you take a text and the sequence of words in the

1069
01:02:46,279 --> 01:02:48,109
a text and the sequence of words in the text right you can think of that as the

1070
01:02:48,109 --> 01:02:51,650
text right you can think of that as the dynamical system and in essence you can

1071
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:53,690
dynamical system and in essence you can write an essay you can write the

1072
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:57,140
write an essay you can write the homework with a computer program where

1073
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,420
homework with a computer program where you know it randomly selects words from

1074
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:01,640
you know it randomly selects words from the dictionary using the previous words

1075
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:05,000
the dictionary using the previous words and you submit a whole paper but it's a

1076
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,799
and you submit a whole paper but it's a computer mate right and and I am sure

1077
01:03:09,799 --> 01:03:13,640
computer mate right and and I am sure lots of people do that ok this day so

1078
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:17,539
lots of people do that ok this day so that is interesting is if you use a Mac

1079
01:03:17,539 --> 01:03:19,670
that is interesting is if you use a Mac avianna function and the product rule

1080
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,980
avianna function and the product rule you can see the immediate simplification

1081
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:25,730
you can see the immediate simplification right so you can see here giving X 3

1082
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:28,039
right so you can see here giving X 3 depending on X 1 and X 2 you have only X

1083
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:30,980
depending on X 1 and X 2 you have only X 3 depending on X 2 X 2 and XT minus 12

1084
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:34,160
3 depending on X 2 X 2 and XT minus 12 so the variables that you need to keep

1085
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,550
so the variables that you need to keep track of if each of this is

1086
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:41,660
track of if each of this is gay values you know you only have just a

1087
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:44,660
gay values you know you only have just a stage for its XP this time matrices of

1088
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:48,880
stage for its XP this time matrices of the order of K square right so this is

1089
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,950
the order of K square right so this is way much less complexity to be done it

1090
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:56,800
way much less complexity to be done it without them Markovian assumption okay

1091
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,470
without them Markovian assumption okay [Applause]

1092
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:04,820
[Applause] so we are sure that this problem is the

1093
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:06,350
so we are sure that this problem is the mode of the gives me the evolution of

1094
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:07,670
mode of the gives me the evolution of the state

1095
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:10,790
the state if you expressly parametrically then we

1096
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:12,980
if you expressly parametrically then we assume that but then the parameters to

1097
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,350
assume that but then the parameters to that model don't change with time okay

1098
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:19,910
that model don't change with time okay and generally speaking trying to compute

1099
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:23,180
and generally speaking trying to compute the parameters in this model is known as

1100
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,910
the parameters in this model is known as certainly a trivial problem so you know

1101
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:27,890
certainly a trivial problem so you know when you have you try to model something

1102
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:34,040
when you have you try to model something with a Markov chain for example and if

1103
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,260
with a Markov chain for example and if you make this amount I only distribution

1104
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,300
you make this amount I only distribution for example something like that you know

1105
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,580
for example something like that you know you are going to have a lot of unknowns

1106
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:43,250
you are going to have a lot of unknowns in defining this distribution and the

1107
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:45,620
in defining this distribution and the only way to compute them is by using

1108
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:47,660
only way to compute them is by using data alright so if you know you can do

1109
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,970
data alright so if you know you can do much more active with estimation what as

1110
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:53,330
much more active with estimation what as we consider implemented through the EM

1111
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:56,210
we consider implemented through the EM algorithm or maybe do a mapping but then

1112
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:59,270
algorithm or maybe do a mapping but then assume that you start with it no you

1113
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,430
assume that you start with it no you have to learn this and then cook is not

1114
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,010
have to learn this and then cook is not being predictions influence of the rat

1115
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:08,000
being predictions influence of the rat okay so we only assume that xn plus 1

1116
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,390
okay so we only assume that xn plus 1 differential xn but in which way you

1117
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:14,510
differential xn but in which way you know what is this table that's something

1118
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:17,870
know what is this table that's something to do

1119
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:17,880


1120
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:28,190
for HIV so what you see here is basically what we described for the this

1121
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,750
basically what we described for the this is this impression you see on the bottom

1122
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,970
is this impression you see on the bottom is basically the Cleary's out what the

1123
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,740
is basically the Cleary's out what the Montpellier assumption is used right and

1124
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:37,640
Montpellier assumption is used right and this is what allow us to go from and the

1125
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,250
this is what allow us to go from and the composition that depends for XP depends

1126
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:42,080
composition that depends for XP depends on all the previous variables to extent

1127
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,900
on all the previous variables to extent it depends only on X 3 minus 1 okay you

1128
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,760
it depends only on X 3 minus 1 okay you can a better way since we're talking

1129
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,770
can a better way since we're talking about published graphical models you can

1130
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:52,100
about published graphical models you can see immediately that given X 2 X 1 and X

1131
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:54,560
see immediately that given X 2 X 1 and X 3 are independent right so when you

1132
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,510
3 are independent right so when you write the probability of X 3 given X 1

1133
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:59,660
write the probability of X 3 given X 1 and X 2 that you get here you can get

1134
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:02,480
and X 2 that you get here you can get rid of X 1 given X 2 right because they

1135
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,630
rid of X 1 given X 2 right because they are independent I think because of the

1136
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:11,210
are independent I think because of the separation okay so you know will be 2 so

1137
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:12,830
separation okay so you know will be 2 so we like us rhabdo

1138
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:15,290
we like us rhabdo this this graphical model immediately

1139
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:18,260
this this graphical model immediately implies that the question ok all right

1140
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:23,210
implies that the question ok all right so given X 2 X 1 and X 3 are independent

1141
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:31,390
so given X 2 X 1 and X 3 are independent you can all right so let me keep going

1142
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:34,970
you can all right so let me keep going so this matrix you know assuming that

1143
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:36,860
so this matrix you know assuming that the states of the script we are going to

1144
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:40,400
the states of the script we are going to call this an ALJ matrix right and

1145
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,990
call this an ALJ matrix right and eventually we have to find some way to

1146
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:46,190
eventually we have to find some way to compute from data ok so this is sort of

1147
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:50,360
compute from data ok so this is sort of our state transition diagram that you

1148
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,890
our state transition diagram that you can demonstrate basically this

1149
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:55,220
can demonstrate basically this probabilities circuit with some

1150
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,990
probabilities circuit with some schematic that looks like that so you

1151
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:59,780
schematic that looks like that so you know here there is a self transition

1152
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,170
know here there is a self transition probability from state 1 back to state 1

1153
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:06,080
probability from state 1 back to state 1 transition state 2 but no to state 3 and

1154
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:10,130
transition state 2 but no to state 3 and notice in state 3 basically there is no

1155
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:11,360
notice in state 3 basically there is no way you can escape because the

1156
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,150
way you can escape because the probability of being back to state 3 is

1157
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:17,060
probability of being back to state 3 is 1 right so this is sort of an

1158
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:20,090
1 right so this is sort of an interesting case in this diagram you

1159
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:20,570
interesting case in this diagram you will not be

1160
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:24,590
will not be from three to escape and go back to one

1161
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:31,460
from three to escape and go back to one and two okay all right

1162
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:34,190
and two okay all right so the transition matrix in this case is

1163
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:38,560
so the transition matrix in this case is a 1 1 a 1 2 A 2 2 a 2 3 and 1

1164
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:42,920
a 1 1 a 1 2 A 2 2 a 2 3 and 1 well that's a choice and more

1165
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,800
well that's a choice and more interesting transition matrix square we

1166
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:50,150
interesting transition matrix square we have self transition okay and so this is

1167
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:52,670
have self transition okay and so this is best in transition from state 1 the

1168
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:55,220
best in transition from state 1 the first roll to map to state 1 state 2

1169
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:57,320
first roll to map to state 1 state 2 state 3 so this probabilities have to

1170
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,650
state 3 so this probabilities have to sum to 1 you notice every loss how to do

1171
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:03,380
sum to 1 you notice every loss how to do one and in this case that say we are

1172
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:06,980
one and in this case that say we are skewing that the probability of initial

1173
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:12,260
skewing that the probability of initial state is given as 1 3 1 3 1 3 so if best

1174
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,240
state is given as 1 3 1 3 1 3 so if best an equal chance of being in any other

1175
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:20,300
an equal chance of being in any other state thank you

1176
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:23,990
state thank you you start with the state with this

1177
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:25,490
you start with the state with this probability this is your initial

1178
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:30,440
probability this is your initial probability and I ask you to tell me

1179
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:35,140
probability and I ask you to tell me what's going to happen long term to

1180
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:37,849
what's going to happen long term to calculate the probability of being at

1181
01:08:37,849 --> 01:08:40,940
calculate the probability of being at the given state after into a time how

1182
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:45,020
the given state after into a time how are you going to implement this just in

1183
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,750
are you going to implement this just in three lines quote so let me give you

1184
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,310
three lines quote so let me give you this and I give you this transition

1185
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:51,860
this and I give you this transition matrix and I'm asked them to compute for

1186
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:57,349
matrix and I'm asked them to compute for me what we you know the probability of

1187
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:59,240
me what we you know the probability of being in state 1 state 2 state 3 is

1188
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,540
being in state 1 state 2 state 3 is going to be at time infinity

1189
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:05,630
going to be at time infinity assuming that have somehow this chain

1190
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:09,800
assuming that have somehow this chain converges okay so how do i implement

1191
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,610
converges okay so how do i implement this we may struggle a little but it's

1192
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:22,680
this we may struggle a little but it's been online that does this

1193
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:22,690


1194
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:32,180
step rather than

1195
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:32,190


1196
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:38,030
you're gonna start moving on this on different states right with the

1197
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:41,090
different states right with the dynamical model apply by a so I'm gonna

1198
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:44,090
dynamical model apply by a so I'm gonna write the software to do that so what do

1199
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:50,430
write the software to do that so what do you have to do the first step

1200
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:50,440


1201
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:56,609
exactly yeah very good excellent

1202
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:56,619


1203
01:09:56,619 --> 01:10:02,549
I have to give feedback right so they think am i responding to the class okay

1204
01:10:02,549 --> 01:10:10,450
think am i responding to the class okay so what do we do

1205
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:10,460


1206
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:15,940
so we basically have to select with this probabilities something to start and

1207
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:20,980
probabilities something to start and then assuming that say we select the

1208
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,620
then assuming that say we select the second state then we're going to have to

1209
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,900
second state then we're going to have to select with this probabilities to what's

1210
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:29,020
select with this probabilities to what's a good transition from state one and we

1211
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,390
a good transition from state one and we make transition with this to take one

1212
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,340
make transition with this to take one backward to take two of state three and

1213
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:35,800
backward to take two of state three and then keep repeating this with the hope

1214
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,290
then keep repeating this with the hope that somehow at the end of the day we're

1215
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:39,580
that somehow at the end of the day we're gonna reach some stationary distribution

1216
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:42,190
gonna reach some stationary distribution and we will introduce twelve only one

1217
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:44,500
and we will introduce twelve only one stationary distribution for this Markov

1218
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:51,520
stationary distribution for this Markov chains exist now can you tell me I mean

1219
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,440
chains exist now can you tell me I mean this is something we are keenly covered

1220
01:10:53,440 --> 01:11:01,060
this is something we are keenly covered on lectures in hope maybe but if

1221
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,680
on lectures in hope maybe but if somebody gives you this distribution and

1222
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:05,260
somebody gives you this distribution and say sample from this distribution how do

1223
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:10,000
say sample from this distribution how do we do this how do something from a given

1224
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,710
we do this how do something from a given distribution and you know that you are

1225
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:19,540
distribution and you know that you are on screen so you should have suffered

1226
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:21,520
on screen so you should have suffered from this can you tell exactly what will

1227
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,260
from this can you tell exactly what will lead you to say among state for your

1228
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:28,419
lead you to say among state for your state to

1229
01:11:28,419 --> 01:11:28,429


1230
01:11:28,429 --> 01:11:42,569
are we gonna do up in online

1231
01:11:42,569 --> 01:11:42,579


1232
01:11:42,579 --> 01:11:52,220
so the original sample from this distribution some of the distribution

1233
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:52,230


1234
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:56,080
I mean how do you sample from discrete distribution that's what I'm asking

1235
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,700
distribution that's what I'm asking that's the single thing to sample from

1236
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:08,939
that's the single thing to sample from discrete distribution

1237
01:12:08,939 --> 01:12:08,949


1238
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:14,850
see there's something from a uniform and let's say from zero to one and if it

1239
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:18,719
let's say from zero to one and if it happens to be let's say hi and then

1240
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:22,139
happens to be let's say hi and then point six six or something then you say

1241
01:12:22,139 --> 01:12:26,279
point six six or something then you say you are now on state three all right

1242
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:28,169
you are now on state three all right similarly if you are higher than point

1243
01:12:28,169 --> 01:12:30,959
similarly if you are higher than point three three but less than that then your

1244
01:12:30,959 --> 01:12:34,500
three three but less than that then your state 2 etc okay so this is how you

1245
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:43,409
state 2 etc okay so this is how you sample from discrete distribution since

1246
01:12:43,409 --> 01:12:46,620
sample from discrete distribution since we defined this transition probability a

1247
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:50,370
we defined this transition probability a I J what we often use and the location

1248
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:55,649
I J what we often use and the location is also a LJ for this transition

1249
01:12:55,649 --> 01:12:57,899
is also a LJ for this transition probability basically transition is from

1250
01:12:57,899 --> 01:12:58,529
probability basically transition is from I to J

1251
01:12:58,529 --> 01:13:01,979
I to J but in n steps the idea being is that

1252
01:13:01,979 --> 01:13:06,060
but in n steps the idea being is that you start at time T at state I and after

1253
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:09,569
you start at time T at state I and after n steps even and yourself in state Z so

1254
01:13:09,569 --> 01:13:10,469
n steps even and yourself in state Z so this is the N step transition

1255
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:13,399
this is the N step transition probability and effectively this

1256
01:13:13,399 --> 01:13:17,399
probability and effectively this satisfies the Commonwealth equation that

1257
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:19,290
satisfies the Commonwealth equation that what you have seen it in many different

1258
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:23,339
what you have seen it in many different contexts in LD in this course so you can

1259
01:13:23,339 --> 01:13:27,060
contexts in LD in this course so you can think if you want transition in M plus n

1260
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:30,389
think if you want transition in M plus n steps from I to J that you can do is you

1261
01:13:30,389 --> 01:13:33,449
steps from I to J that you can do is you can transition them steps decay for a

1262
01:13:33,449 --> 01:13:35,729
can transition them steps decay for a possible case and then in the remaining

1263
01:13:35,729 --> 01:13:37,739
possible case and then in the remaining n steps transition from K today

1264
01:13:37,739 --> 01:13:39,629
n steps transition from K today so the Commonwealth equation basically

1265
01:13:39,629 --> 01:13:43,139
so the Commonwealth equation basically looks like that ok and increased for

1266
01:13:43,139 --> 01:13:49,080
looks like that ok and increased for this allows you to write you know this n

1267
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:52,649
this allows you to write you know this n step transition matrix the way that you

1268
01:13:52,649 --> 01:13:57,689
step transition matrix the way that you see here okay so don't sort of the

1269
01:13:57,689 --> 01:13:59,879
see here okay so don't sort of the liberal interpretation of this because

1270
01:13:59,879 --> 01:14:01,739
liberal interpretation of this because the interpretation of this for is

1271
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:03,449
the interpretation of this for is basically the Commonwealth equation that

1272
01:14:03,449 --> 01:14:08,500
basically the Commonwealth equation that which is there

1273
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:08,510


1274
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:14,080
I think this problems are very difficult but you can see in on the picture on the

1275
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,710
but you can see in on the picture on the bottom for example that you know after a

1276
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:19,210
bottom for example that you know after a few steps because we need to initialize

1277
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:21,910
few steps because we need to initialize things the state explored now depends on

1278
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:25,150
things the state explored now depends on X 3 but also depends on X 2 and X 1 so

1279
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:29,530
X 3 but also depends on X 2 and X 1 so this is the Markov chain basically or

1280
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:32,140
this is the Markov chain basically or thanks flow so this is a way a little

1281
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:35,740
thanks flow so this is a way a little bit more complicated problem and so you

1282
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:38,530
bit more complicated problem and so you keep track dependence is basically that

1283
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:46,959
keep track dependence is basically that the grab back from X for X 1

1284
01:14:46,959 --> 01:14:46,969


1285
01:14:46,969 --> 01:14:52,959
well it said you know what myself now I want to do this example

1286
01:14:52,959 --> 01:14:54,910
want to do this example so he just described and we will

1287
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:57,700
so he just described and we will continue on this next week and I will

1288
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,220
continue on this next week and I will put the notes played tomorrow so you can

1289
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,959
put the notes played tomorrow so you can read it all right so the notes is

1290
01:15:01,959 --> 01:15:05,830
read it all right so the notes is basically to try to build a probability

1291
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:10,090
basically to try to build a probability model for writing a language speaking

1292
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:13,180
model for writing a language speaking language okay so the idea is you know

1293
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:15,520
language okay so the idea is you know we're going to have to assign some

1294
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,110
we're going to have to assign some probability for each word and you can

1295
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:20,170
probability for each word and you can take it to be beautiful some probability

1296
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:21,670
take it to be beautiful some probability from transition from one world to

1297
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:25,750
from transition from one world to another this is the bigram probability

1298
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,850
another this is the bigram probability and then a transition from two previous

1299
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:32,080
and then a transition from two previous words to a third world okay so you can

1300
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,540
words to a third world okay so you can actually use this if you build model for

1301
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:36,370
actually use this if you build model for this which means you have to learn the

1302
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:39,520
this which means you have to learn the parameters from this from given spoken

1303
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,920
parameters from this from given spoken English or text you can actually use

1304
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,370
English or text you can actually use this to complete the sentence and this

1305
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:47,260
this to complete the sentence and this Barry I was told when I was young it's

1306
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:49,420
Barry I was told when I was young it's very polite to complete the sentence or

1307
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:54,520
very polite to complete the sentence or Father's right it seems when I teach I

1308
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,050
Father's right it seems when I teach I do that all the time remember

1309
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:58,990
do that all the time remember I just complete the sentence that I say

1310
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:03,209
I just complete the sentence that I say thank you so that's not very polite okay

1311
01:16:03,209 --> 01:16:07,540
thank you so that's not very polite okay and not a joke you can actually use this

1312
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:11,530
and not a joke you can actually use this to write document you know once you

1313
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:13,870
to write document you know once you start it and it learns this transition

1314
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:16,060
start it and it learns this transition probabilities you can start picking up a

1315
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,130
probabilities you can start picking up a random words using the previous ones

1316
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:20,580
random words using the previous ones arranging you have a whole document and

1317
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:23,650
arranging you have a whole document and and maybe you will like that okay so

1318
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:25,840
and maybe you will like that okay so this have how these transition

1319
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,459
this have how these transition probabilities would look like so this is

1320
01:16:27,459 --> 01:16:30,670
probabilities would look like so this is for the probabilities of different

1321
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:31,720
for the probabilities of different letters in the alphabet

1322
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,490
letters in the alphabet okay

1323
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:35,740
okay and the system this has been computed by

1324
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:39,760
and the system this has been computed by using a given a textbook and these are

1325
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,290
using a given a textbook and these are the Biograph probabilities that gives

1326
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:42,760
the Biograph probabilities that gives you the transition from one letter to

1327
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,670
you the transition from one letter to another this is like a human diagram

1328
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:48,270
another this is like a human diagram that maybe you have seen it in

1329
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:52,090
that maybe you have seen it in presentation of this vibro probability

1330
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:53,890
presentation of this vibro probability in other contexts so the bigger this Y

1331
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:56,050
in other contexts so the bigger this Y dot the higher the probability so

1332
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:59,440
dot the higher the probability so obviously you're not going to go from a

1333
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,280
obviously you're not going to go from a to a writer has very low probability

1334
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:07,510
to a writer has very low probability from a 12 you know and if you look from

1335
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:12,640
from a 12 you know and if you look from n2i that's significant

1336
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,460
n2i that's significant okay because they have too many nicolas

1337
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:22,390
okay because they have too many nicolas around right Nick all right okay so what

1338
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:24,340
around right Nick all right okay so what I want to tell you and we just thing is

1339
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,800
I want to tell you and we just thing is there I want you to tell how we're

1340
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,040
there I want you to tell how we're actually going to use a document to

1341
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,840
actually going to use a document to compute this transition probabilities

1342
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,850
compute this transition probabilities and we're gonna use maximum likelihood

1343
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,050
and we're gonna use maximum likelihood to do that all right

1344
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:39,760
to do that all right so effectively the calculation will be

1345
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,250
so effectively the calculation will be sort of an elementary introduction to

1346
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:44,080
sort of an elementary introduction to the way we're going to be map estimation

1347
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,510
the way we're going to be map estimation for state space model so we're going to

1348
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:48,850
for state space model so we're going to achieve this in the Delta national

1349
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:51,310
achieve this in the Delta national velocity what is the effect of this type

1350
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:53,380
velocity what is the effect of this type of Emily estimate when you have limited

1351
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:58,480
of Emily estimate when you have limited data so because moisturisers I don't

1352
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:01,240
data so because moisturisers I don't have more than two
