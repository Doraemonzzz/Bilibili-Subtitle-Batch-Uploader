1
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:38,020
but I was not waiting for anybody else to show up we need to start this bill 51

2
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,390
to show up we need to start this bill 51 so I'm gonna try to finish state-space

3
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,960
so I'm gonna try to finish state-space models today there will be more things

4
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,580
models today there will be more things in where they are then unbelievers as

5
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:57,920
in where they are then unbelievers as they say and more okay so where I was

6
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,500
they say and more okay so where I was gonna say what we are trying to finish

7
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,570
gonna say what we are trying to finish states based on those but there is lots

8
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,750
states based on those but there is lots of stuff in the notes that I don't think

9
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,140
of stuff in the notes that I don't think I will cover so that you don't get a

10
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,600
I will cover so that you don't get a headache and also we can discuss more

11
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,940
headache and also we can discuss more topics so what I want to do today is

12
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,690
topics so what I want to do today is something sort of elementary and some

13
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,530
something sort of elementary and some ways implied in in the things we have

14
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,750
ways implied in in the things we have seen before I you know so last lecture

15
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,290
seen before I you know so last lecture we derived the turn of history questions

16
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,740
we derived the turn of history questions for linear dynamical systems from

17
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,470
for linear dynamical systems from scratch basically we looked at the

18
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,290
scratch basically we looked at the questions we said this this independence

19
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,180
questions we said this this independence relations and playing with probability

20
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,840
relations and playing with probability laws we derived the the color pintura

21
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,270
laws we derived the the color pintura question so what I want to do is I want

22
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,210
question so what I want to do is I want to show you that in essence everything

23
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,630
to show you that in essence everything we learn about rest is passing when we

24
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,550
we learn about rest is passing when we apply that to the other amical systems

25
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,960
apply that to the other amical systems actually will give us directly the the

26
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,960
actually will give us directly the the the color of military questions and can

27
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,530
the color of military questions and can be generalized as well so I'm going to

28
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,949
be generalized as well so I'm going to do this highlight basically some of the

29
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:09,890
do this highlight basically some of the derivation the way they go they are not

30
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,370
derivation the way they go they are not trivial so so in some sense you're doing

31
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,340
trivial so so in some sense you're doing extra airport using masters passing but

32
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,260
extra airport using masters passing but at the expense basically of having an

33
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,240
at the expense basically of having an algorithm of this very general okay in

34
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,100
algorithm of this very general okay in considering the district or some

35
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,530
considering the district or some probabilistic graphical models what we

36
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,540
probabilistic graphical models what we have to do I will suggest actually that

37
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,050
have to do I will suggest actually that you guys'

38
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,280
you guys' the homework 5 maybe you do some of the

39
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,810
the homework 5 maybe you do some of the analytical calculations that we

40
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,320
analytical calculations that we discussed today because there is much to

41
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,450
discussed today because there is much to learn and they are not very difficult

42
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,700
learn and they are not very difficult but in essence if you do them you have a

43
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,310
but in essence if you do them you have a good sense of both masters passing but

44
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,860
good sense of both masters passing but also of you know dealing with the carbon

45
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,670
also of you know dealing with the carbon of in two types of equations all right

46
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:04,470
of in two types of equations all right so let me review for you the factor

47
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,920
so let me review for you the factor graph that corresponds to the state

48
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,590
graph that corresponds to the state space model of interest the only thing

49
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,560
space model of interest the only thing that is different here that I want to

50
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,870
that is different here that I want to remind you is that the way that we

51
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,540
remind you is that the way that we define the structure nodes we

52
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,720
define the structure nodes we incorporated both the transition model P

53
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,450
incorporated both the transition model P of Z enthusiam from Zn minus 1 to the N

54
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,690
of Z enthusiam from Zn minus 1 to the N but also the observation model so keep

55
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,880
but also the observation model so keep that in mind so it looks like a same

56
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,400
that in mind so it looks like a same thing but in reality we have accounted

57
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,870
thing but in reality we have accounted for what probability non-factor in

58
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,760
for what probability non-factor in similarly for the first part of her age

59
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,750
similarly for the first part of her age is the probability of the initial state

60
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,210
is the probability of the initial state in the observation model in the initial

61
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:45,690
in the observation model in the initial State

62
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,310
State alright so the message passing and you

63
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,870
alright so the message passing and you don't have to remember any questions

64
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,290
don't have to remember any questions because really it is graphical so let's

65
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,750
because really it is graphical so let's concentrate on this equation we only

66
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,990
concentrate on this equation we only look at messages that factors past the

67
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,870
look at messages that factors past the node all right the nose can actually do

68
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,450
node all right the nose can actually do anything in this draft so the message

69
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,460
anything in this draft so the message from FN to Zn is the factor itself all

70
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,680
from FN to Zn is the factor itself all right which connects the bottom of Zn

71
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,920
right which connects the bottom of Zn minus 1 is G n times the message that

72
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,990
minus 1 is G n times the message that the factor of Zn minus 1 that is some

73
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,090
the factor of Zn minus 1 that is some curved air passes to note the N minus 1

74
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,120
curved air passes to note the N minus 1 well it makes sense whatever comes st.

75
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,700
well it makes sense whatever comes st. plus the factor then you integrate the N

76
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,400
plus the factor then you integrate the N minus 1 out and you get the earth now if

77
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,970
minus 1 out and you get the earth now if this the variables are continuous would

78
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,090
this the variables are continuous would be in our problem

79
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,690
be in our problem that summation would be an integral okay

80
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,450
that summation would be an integral okay the first equation basically says that

81
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,130
the first equation basically says that the message that the notes positive

82
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,400
the message that the notes positive factor is the same as the message the

83
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,190
factor is the same as the message the previous from the bus is known so in

84
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,840
previous from the bus is known so in essence it emphasizes that we are just

85
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,080
essence it emphasizes that we are just happy enough to only work with messages

86
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,300
happy enough to only work with messages from factors to know you don't need to

87
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,930
from factors to know you don't need to bother progressing for multiparty all

88
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,870
bother progressing for multiparty all right so this is the common message

89
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,230
right so this is the common message passing and we call this the alpha

90
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,920
passing and we call this the alpha message okay and we discuss sort of two

91
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,630
message okay and we discuss sort of two different notations you know one that

92
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:23,090
different notations you know one that the message corresponding to this it was

93
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,610
the message corresponding to this it was the posterior of Zn given all the data

94
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,540
the posterior of Zn given all the data at the time and and I think another

95
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,390
at the time and and I think another notation was a nun normalized posterior

96
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,170
notation was a nun normalized posterior effectively so if you don't want to get

97
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,150
effectively so if you don't want to get confused with the notation effectively

98
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,210
confused with the notation effectively you can write that this is proportional

99
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,160
you can write that this is proportional to what you see on the right-hand side

100
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,500
to what you see on the right-hand side so when you compute the right-hand side

101
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,230
so when you compute the right-hand side then you normalize it and you get a

102
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,390
then you normalize it and you get a distribution so one way or another

103
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,430
distribution so one way or another it doesn't really matter if you see

104
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,130
it doesn't really matter if you see different notations okay so this is the

105
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,650
different notations okay so this is the forward messages and I also want to show

106
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,320
forward messages and I also want to show you the same schematic basically the

107
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,160
you the same schematic basically the backward messages from the root to no

108
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,150
backward messages from the root to no dates to the left so the message the

109
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,100
dates to the left so the message the message passing is basically identical

110
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,260
message passing is basically identical to before the things but it goes

111
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,930
to before the things but it goes backwards so the message from the

112
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,730
backwards so the message from the factory and the little the masters from

113
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:25,100
factory and the little the masters from at n plus one to note the end alright so

114
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,570
at n plus one to note the end alright so again we are making a messages from

115
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,680
again we are making a messages from practice to notes so this message here

116
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,830
practice to notes so this message here okay

117
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,670
okay is this factor

118
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:37,010
is this factor why is the message without the factor of

119
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,500
why is the message without the factor of ten plus two cents to note ZL plus one

120
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,820
ten plus two cents to note ZL plus one which is this and obviously this message

121
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,449
which is this and obviously this message the same as that business right so again

122
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:49,970
the same as that business right so again this message is this factor times this

123
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,460
this message is this factor times this message where we integrate out to the n

124
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,980
message where we integrate out to the n plus one and obviously you can see that

125
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,870
plus one and obviously you can see that this process is backwards because we

126
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,829
this process is backwards because we require this message to the right to

127
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:02,930
require this message to the right to compute the rest to the left and the

128
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,139
compute the rest to the left and the integration is to the variables to the

129
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:09,230
integration is to the variables to the right which is in this case Zn plus 1

130
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,250
right which is in this case Zn plus 1 and we call this the mega message okay

131
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,079
and we call this the mega message okay so the bigger message go backwards the

132
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:17,840
so the bigger message go backwards the Alpha message is to go forward so what

133
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,490
Alpha message is to go forward so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to play with

134
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,400
I'm gonna do is I'm going to play with its equations and device for you they

135
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,600
its equations and device for you they come up in three questions and it looks

136
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,740
come up in three questions and it looks sort of a massive algebraic calculation

137
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,150
sort of a massive algebraic calculation but I recommend that you do it because

138
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,370
but I recommend that you do it because not only you'll be happy that you

139
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,880
not only you'll be happy that you discover the Kalman filter equations

140
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,420
discover the Kalman filter equations from a completely different way from the

141
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,620
from a completely different way from the way carbon driver which is actually

142
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,300
way carbon driver which is actually different from the one we already have

143
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,790
different from the one we already have done in the earlier lecture but there is

144
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,920
done in the earlier lecture but there is much to learn both from Esther's passing

145
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,610
much to learn both from Esther's passing and playing with a gaussians

146
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,660
and playing with a gaussians conditionals partial answers to things

147
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,949
conditionals partial answers to things like that okay so I am going to use

148
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:08,660
like that okay so I am going to use first the form of the question that

149
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,400
first the form of the question that defines the Alpha messages so and again

150
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,790
defines the Alpha messages so and again as I told you if you don't you know want

151
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,769
as I told you if you don't you know want to worry what the normalization constant

152
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:22,639
to worry what the normalization constant here is or without fires you don't need

153
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,519
here is or without fires you don't need to bother okay you just say this is

154
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,889
to bother okay you just say this is proportional throughout and you

155
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:30,079
proportional throughout and you normalize and with every good luck to be

156
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,210
normalize and with every good luck to be the Alpha messages but fear I'm writing

157
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,480
the Alpha messages but fear I'm writing it in a precise for okay where this

158
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,049
it in a precise for okay where this message is the posterior of Zn given

159
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:42,889
message is the posterior of Zn given all the the date of the observations of

160
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:45,139
all the the date of the observations of Japan man okay

161
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:50,119
Japan man okay and this quotation is GL Scylla is

162
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,859
and this quotation is GL Scylla is basically the probability of friction

163
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:58,609
basically the probability of friction given X 1 to X n minus 1 okay again

164
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:02,359
given X 1 to X n minus 1 okay again if you like this rather than having this

165
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:04,159
if you like this rather than having this filtering distribution we have the joint

166
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,719
filtering distribution we have the joint distribution of Zn relaxed one to excel

167
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:11,539
distribution of Zn relaxed one to excel you're not going to get that TN okay but

168
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:13,399
you're not going to get that TN okay but more or less the question of sort of the

169
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,509
more or less the question of sort of the same alright so if you look at these

170
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,129
same alright so if you look at these equations right and obviously we're

171
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:20,839
equations right and obviously we're gonna make that summation and integral

172
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:27,649
gonna make that summation and integral and we want to get a methodology to make

173
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:30,229
and we want to get a methodology to make derive an inference algorithm that is

174
00:11:30,229 --> 00:11:32,569
derive an inference algorithm that is linearly the length of the chain

175
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:34,729
linearly the length of the chain we need sort of to take advantage of the

176
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:37,399
we need sort of to take advantage of the structure of this equation in a way that

177
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,439
structure of this equation in a way that when we plug in here whatever

178
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:43,519
when we plug in here whatever distribution this alpha lessons is we

179
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,409
distribution this alpha lessons is we would like to get the same sort of

180
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:48,729
would like to get the same sort of distribution for the masses out partying

181
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:52,489
distribution for the masses out partying and in some sense if this belongs to

182
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:55,159
and in some sense if this belongs to some family of distributions we would

183
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,929
some family of distributions we would like the only thing to have to do when

184
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:59,149
like the only thing to have to do when we apply this equation to update the

185
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,699
we apply this equation to update the parameters of this distribution to get

186
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:05,119
parameters of this distribution to get the distribution of GA right so this is

187
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:07,549
the distribution of GA right so this is a Gaussian for example right it would be

188
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:10,189
a Gaussian for example right it would be great if somehow this is also a Gaussian

189
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:12,349
great if somehow this is also a Gaussian and the only thing we have to do is

190
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:14,719
and the only thing we have to do is update the mean and the variance of the

191
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,479
update the mean and the variance of the previous distribution okay now this was

192
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:20,179
previous distribution okay now this was doing gaussians right and this you know

193
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:23,059
doing gaussians right and this you know will fit perfectly with any distribution

194
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:26,089
will fit perfectly with any distribution from the exponential family but today we

195
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:28,459
from the exponential family but today we will discuss basically this the Gaussian

196
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:33,920
will discuss basically this the Gaussian distribution okay

197
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:33,930


198
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:40,980
now if so we're gonna take another Miss Landow in state space model where

199
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,379
Landow in state space model where basically what the probability of Zn

200
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:45,900
basically what the probability of Zn given CN - trauma and the probability of

201
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,189
given CN - trauma and the probability of Excel given Zn are Gaussian and then at

202
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:52,889
Excel given Zn are Gaussian and then at the end of the day basically all the

203
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:54,619
the end of the day basically all the distributions were going to get will be

204
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:58,230
distributions were going to get will be gaussians so the Joint Distribution of

205
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,150
gaussians so the Joint Distribution of correlated volumes to be a multivariate

206
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:04,170
correlated volumes to be a multivariate Gaussian and we have seen actually this

207
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,660
Gaussian and we have seen actually this problem letting you have done it you

208
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,449
problem letting you have done it you sort of done a homework problem with

209
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:11,819
sort of done a homework problem with this but we will see a different

210
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:14,429
this but we will see a different perspective here so let me give you the

211
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:17,879
perspective here so let me give you the result summary of the results if you

212
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:22,079
result summary of the results if you apply for a Gaussian linear system the

213
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,809
apply for a Gaussian linear system the forward fasting message equations did

214
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:28,290
forward fasting message equations did you get the identical equations

215
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,009
you get the identical equations corresponding to the color filter okay

216
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:34,079
corresponding to the color filter okay if you apply the support three questions

217
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,569
if you apply the support three questions so you know this is the bigger message

218
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:39,840
so you know this is the bigger message you get the comments motor equations

219
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,150
you get the comments motor equations that I think if I remember we didn't

220
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,910
that I think if I remember we didn't have time to cover in last lecture I may

221
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,059
have time to cover in last lecture I may be wrong but you stop there but you can

222
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:51,540
be wrong but you stop there but you can imagine that similar to the beta message

223
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,699
imagine that similar to the beta message right this government's motion equations

224
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,069
right this government's motion equations basically will give us the posterior of

225
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,879
basically will give us the posterior of specific variables given all the data

226
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,939
specific variables given all the data from 1 to capital T okay that's why this

227
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:05,069
from 1 to capital T okay that's why this equations are quote is moving a

228
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:08,460
equations are quote is moving a questions so this is nice right

229
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,139
questions so this is nice right phone that gives me the Kalman filter

230
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,660
phone that gives me the Kalman filter bar forgives with it's moving equations

231
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,579
bar forgives with it's moving equations and actually if you do the forward on

232
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:18,389
and actually if you do the forward on the back of the questions you can get

233
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:21,030
the back of the questions you can get the sufficient statistics from the

234
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,860
the sufficient statistics from the hidden variables that are needed to

235
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,379
hidden variables that are needed to compute the parameters view expectation

236
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:28,769
compute the parameters view expectation maximization you know ever that when we

237
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:31,350
maximization you know ever that when we did the hmm so we will actually turn to

238
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,360
did the hmm so we will actually turn to our crystals highlight for you the

239
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,350
our crystals highlight for you the questions if you don't need to

240
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,120
questions if you don't need to the parameters and they're fixed right

241
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,269
the parameters and they're fixed right depending on what your interest is if

242
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:43,670
depending on what your interest is if you want the predicted distributions the

243
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,230
you want the predicted distributions the floor where the questions will do is if

244
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,120
floor where the questions will do is if you want this more thing the backward

245
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,550
you want this more thing the backward will do it if you're gonna do the amount

246
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,620
will do it if you're gonna do the amount we have to basically do more how can be

247
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,340
we have to basically do more how can be the lesson I'm gonna use the notation

248
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,389
the lesson I'm gonna use the notation from Bishop's book actually to simplify

249
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:02,210
from Bishop's book actually to simplify the notation for the you variables that

250
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,940
the notation for the you variables that we had but the fact we there were

251
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,600
we had but the fact we there were nothing else but a constant term in the

252
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,610
nothing else but a constant term in the the mean of these distributions I

253
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,160
the mean of these distributions I omitted here but actually if you can

254
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,829
omitted here but actually if you can solve you can take the final results in

255
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:18,590
solve you can take the final results in with a trivial trick you can discover

256
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,769
with a trivial trick you can discover the you know the modify the question

257
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:23,630
the you know the modify the question when there is an extra term of the means

258
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,449
when there is an extra term of the means here but right now concentrate on the

259
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:28,310
here but right now concentrate on the greatest or questioners look like right

260
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:35,509
greatest or questioners look like right so a an Rama will decline the transition

261
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:38,300
so a an Rama will decline the transition model for the states and this is the

262
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,900
model for the states and this is the observation model with metrics it here

263
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,110
observation model with metrics it here Sigma and C n Sigma remember this

264
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,720
Sigma and C n Sigma remember this because I will forget the and we will be

265
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,100
because I will forget the and we will be lost to the algebra okay so a and gamma

266
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,449
lost to the algebra okay so a and gamma C and Sigma we supposed to from some

267
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:59,060
C and Sigma we supposed to from some initial state and so the initial state

268
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,530
initial state and so the initial state is going to be given also as a Gaussian

269
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,009
is going to be given also as a Gaussian I mean we you can see actually later on

270
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:06,850
I mean we you can see actually later on maybe in the slide if we have time and

271
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,130
maybe in the slide if we have time and remember I will let you know if this is

272
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,590
remember I will let you know if this is somehow not a Gaussian Gaussian mixture

273
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,100
somehow not a Gaussian Gaussian mixture then you don't get you get the different

274
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,590
then you don't get you get the different equations and kind of filtering right so

275
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,930
equations and kind of filtering right so this is not a job basically in to start

276
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,000
this is not a job basically in to start with a Gaussian otherwise you may get in

277
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,460
with a Gaussian otherwise you may get in trouble so mister questions basically if

278
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,380
trouble so mister questions basically if you don't want them in written in terms

279
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,630
you don't want them in written in terms of distributions you know this is how

280
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,009
of distributions you know this is how the questions look like they are all

281
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:33,319
the questions look like they are all linear right big asked why we call this

282
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:34,960
linear right big asked why we call this a linear dynamical

283
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:41,330
a linear dynamical so later on we will actually if I don't

284
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,800
so later on we will actually if I don't have time you would have to read it

285
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,610
have time you would have to read it right but we can expect this where for

286
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,500
right but we can expect this where for example here rather than having

287
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,210
example here rather than having something a function of Z n minus 1

288
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,790
something a function of Z n minus 1 maybe we can put some function f of Z n

289
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,200
maybe we can put some function f of Z n minus 1 or here some function G of Z ok

290
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,630
minus 1 or here some function G of Z ok but right now everything is in here and

291
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,510
but right now everything is in here and everything is gone

292
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:06,050
everything is gone so a lot of parameters right so from the

293
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:09,470
so a lot of parameters right so from the dynamics basically we have a and gamma

294
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,440
dynamics basically we have a and gamma from the observation we have C and Sigma

295
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,080
from the observation we have C and Sigma and from the initial model you have mu 0

296
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,990
and from the initial model you have mu 0 and B 0 so really if you want to

297
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,510
and B 0 so really if you want to complete the problem and do expectation

298
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,880
complete the problem and do expectation maximization you need to basically

299
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,810
maximization you need to basically calculate all these parameters from

300
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:33,920
calculate all these parameters from observations okay and in some sense this

301
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,530
observations okay and in some sense this is something at least in engineering

302
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,180
is something at least in engineering books you will ever see you know nobody

303
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,860
books you will ever see you know nobody bothers to tell you how to compute these

304
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,530
bothers to tell you how to compute these parameters but really the algorithm here

305
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,890
parameters but really the algorithm here is just a simple application of e/m the

306
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,530
is just a simple application of e/m the same way we work with hidden Markov

307
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:58,850
same way we work with hidden Markov model ok derive the forward equations

308
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,070
model ok derive the forward equations for this alpha messages and somehow

309
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,950
for this alpha messages and somehow let's discover that mr. questions are

310
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,500
let's discover that mr. questions are really the Kalman filter equations so

311
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,030
really the Kalman filter equations so we're going to do is since this is a

312
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,530
we're going to do is since this is a part with algorithm I'm going to denote

313
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,590
part with algorithm I'm going to denote so everything's a Gaussian so I am going

314
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,420
so everything's a Gaussian so I am going to denote these for the Alpha message

315
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,500
to denote these for the Alpha message you know corresponding to state G n I'm

316
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,150
you know corresponding to state G n I'm going to denote the mean and the

317
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,300
going to denote the mean and the variance is mu N and VN and the idea

318
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,180
variance is mu N and VN and the idea would be that I am going to start with a

319
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,970
would be that I am going to start with a master DN minus 1 so I'm going to know

320
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,190
master DN minus 1 so I'm going to know this mu n minus 1 and VN

321
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,129
this mu n minus 1 and VN one and then somehow using this for

322
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:43,340
one and then somehow using this for growth message-passing equation I should

323
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,480
growth message-passing equation I should be able to update new n minus 1 and DN

324
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,299
be able to update new n minus 1 and DN minus 1 the UN and via ok

325
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,279
minus 1 the UN and via ok nothing major so basically what I have

326
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:56,060
nothing major so basically what I have done is I took this equation and I

327
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,279
done is I took this equation and I expanded it by plugging in all the terms

328
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:02,600
expanded it by plugging in all the terms still CN remember again is really not

329
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,029
still CN remember again is really not necessary sometimes confusing but to

330
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:07,909
necessary sometimes confusing but to make this an equal sign you need that so

331
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:14,480
make this an equal sign you need that so this is the mr. x this Gaussian okay the

332
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,330
this is the mr. x this Gaussian okay the observation model is clear the message

333
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,610
observation model is clear the message at n minus 1 is there so we suppose we

334
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,100
at n minus 1 is there so we suppose we know this and this is the transition

335
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,710
know this and this is the transition model looks like that ends the N minus 1

336
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:29,330
model looks like that ends the N minus 1 is integrated off ok so again the

337
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,919
is integrated off ok so again the problem is given this because we will do

338
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,720
problem is given this because we will do it this as we go forward

339
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:42,240
it this as we go forward we want to compute that okay

340
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,250


341
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,190
and a sponson in the process if we want to have these equations properly

342
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,139
to have these equations properly normalized we will need to update these

343
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:54,119
normalized we will need to update these coefficients here as well all right I am

344
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,070
coefficients here as well all right I am going to take highlight as much as I can

345
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,960
going to take highlight as much as I can all right the rest i really suggest that

346
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,470
all right the rest i really suggest that you do it as a homework okay put in

347
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,100
you do it as a homework okay put in elevation arteries on the slides in the

348
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,039
elevation arteries on the slides in the slides but I want you to just copy this

349
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,710
slides but I want you to just copy this formula is actually going to either

350
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,619
formula is actually going to either because you learned about manipulative

351
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:19,549
because you learned about manipulative gaussians about the Woodbury identity

352
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:23,180
gaussians about the Woodbury identity marginalization conditionals Vegas rule

353
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,720
marginalization conditionals Vegas rule everything is there

354
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,810
everything is there how can you go wrong okay so so when we

355
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,879
how can you go wrong okay so so when we are this first I'm going to look at this

356
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:33,269
are this first I'm going to look at this list

357
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:35,399
list this ain't a grow is this integral in

358
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:39,180
this ain't a grow is this integral in the ocean and why the whole integral and

359
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,710
the ocean and why the whole integral and it is a Gaussian from kinds of magical

360
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,600
it is a Gaussian from kinds of magical are coming to be Gaussian white set out

361
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,960
are coming to be Gaussian white set out listing the glow when we are here on

362
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,600
listing the glow when we are here on this integral

363
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:55,610


364
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:06,930
I have the product of two gaussians but the min of one of them right is linear

365
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:06,940


366
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:16,870
so it's very very heaviest is like having a probability of Y given X all

367
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,030
having a probability of Y given X all right but this linear in X times the

368
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,790
right but this linear in X times the probability of X and what I'm asking is

369
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,220
probability of X and what I'm asking is to find the probability of Y when I

370
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:30,310
to find the probability of Y when I integrate X out right because I won't

371
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,460
integrate X out right because I won't see n minus 1 out right so basically

372
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,110
see n minus 1 out right so basically this is like having the Joint

373
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,970
this is like having the Joint Distribution of two versions then you

374
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,230
Distribution of two versions then you want to multi-role lies

375
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,130
want to multi-role lies okay so the idea is this is the formula

376
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,680
okay so the idea is this is the formula that I cut and paste it not everywhere

377
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,770
that I cut and paste it not everywhere but you guys will do the algebra and you

378
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,010
but you guys will do the algebra and you will learn it better than me so here is

379
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,800
will learn it better than me so here is like having Congress to distribution px

380
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,580
like having Congress to distribution px all right this is given this is given

381
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,990
all right this is given this is given all right hold this P of Y given X all

382
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,630
all right hold this P of Y given X all right and you notice the mean is linear

383
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,840
right and you notice the mean is linear in X which is the N minus 1 you see that

384
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,780
in X which is the N minus 1 you see that there's not be here in the Sigma Y of

385
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,990
there's not be here in the Sigma Y of course is this gamma so from my

386
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,180
course is this gamma so from my information of this for in a Gaussian

387
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,920
information of this for in a Gaussian models P of Y comes to be this nice

388
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,920
models P of Y comes to be this nice distribution that just mean that you

389
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,630
distribution that just mean that you securely has variance that we've set up

390
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,150
securely has variance that we've set up the service you don't need to prove them

391
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,630
the service you don't need to prove them you pull the mouse égalité and and you

392
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,500
you pull the mouse égalité and and you work with them okay be sure when you see

393
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,480
work with them okay be sure when you see them the first time in a textbook we

394
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,640
them the first time in a textbook we derive them because a little mistake in

395
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,920
derive them because a little mistake in the textbook we mess up the rest of your

396
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,270
the textbook we mess up the rest of your lives and I can easily see that because

397
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,770
lives and I can easily see that because I've seen those mistakes in textbooks

398
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:52,770
I've seen those mistakes in textbooks all right in the most common formula so

399
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,050
all right in the most common formula so so why is given like that right so this

400
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:00,040
so why is given like that right so this integral I can write it as a Gaussian

401
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,109
integral I can write it as a Gaussian that looks like that and he comes

402
00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:05,409
that looks like that and he comes that the mean is a times mu n minus 1

403
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:08,409
that the mean is a times mu n minus 1 and the variance is P n minus 1 where

404
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:10,899
and the variance is P n minus 1 where the variance is written by this is

405
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:12,399
the variance is written by this is coming up from this nice form

406
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:14,799
coming up from this nice form okay you don't have to believe me

407
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,119
okay you don't have to believe me because this is the variance you plug it

408
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,049
because this is the variance you plug it in and that's what you get okay

409
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:28,419
in and that's what you get okay all right so obviously I'm putting n

410
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:31,089
all right so obviously I'm putting n minus 1 here everything because you know

411
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:32,589
minus 1 here everything because you know you know this whole divided was fairly

412
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:35,169
you know this whole divided was fairly for the time and minus 1 so we call this

413
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:41,759
for the time and minus 1 so we call this intermediate mathematics PN minus 1 okay

414
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:41,769


415
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:51,249
so this integral it comes out to be a decision in Z so this tentacle is an

416
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:53,679
decision in Z so this tentacle is an arginine shell and what is this thing

417
00:23:53,679 --> 00:24:00,069
arginine shell and what is this thing today is a Gaussian in extent that has

418
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:03,999
today is a Gaussian in extent that has immense linear function of Z so what can

419
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:07,749
immense linear function of Z so what can we do we need to do two things right we

420
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:10,089
we do we need to do two things right we need basically to complete the posterior

421
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:13,119
need basically to complete the posterior of this so here is not marginalization

422
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,999
of this so here is not marginalization what we need to do is sort of from P of

423
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:20,469
what we need to do is sort of from P of X given Y go to P of Y given X all right

424
00:24:20,469 --> 00:24:23,679
X given Y go to P of Y given X all right and this proficiency well is really feel

425
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,979
and this proficiency well is really feel fractious the normalization factor okay

426
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:33,959
fractious the normalization factor okay so so what when so tell us what you need

427
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:39,189
so so what when so tell us what you need you know you know perfect I'm using this

428
00:24:39,189 --> 00:24:42,429
you know you know perfect I'm using this generic notation and P of Y effects and

429
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:44,559
generic notation and P of Y effects and we need to invert this and we need to

430
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,199
we need to invert this and we need to compute P of X given Y and that is given

431
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:50,139
compute P of X given Y and that is given by this nice formal of this mean and

432
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:55,770
by this nice formal of this mean and this variance right and

433
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:55,780


434
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:01,600
and actually there is as I've written down they don't use these variances you

435
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,930
down they don't use these variances you see here all right what the use is they

436
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,320
see here all right what the use is they gives the Woodbury identity where if you

437
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,380
gives the Woodbury identity where if you complete this all right you can simplify

438
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,630
complete this all right you can simplify to actually PN minus 1 minus J n times T

439
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,970
to actually PN minus 1 minus J n times T P and minus 1 for Tyrion comes to this

440
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:24,130
P and minus 1 for Tyrion comes to this and I know you forgot but this KN it is

441
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,160
and I know you forgot but this KN it is identical to what we derived in the last

442
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,890
identical to what we derived in the last lecture which is the column J gain

443
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:37,210
lecture which is the column J gain matrix okay so in this coefficient Sigma

444
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,770
matrix okay so in this coefficient Sigma n okay

445
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:43,390
n okay which is basically least marginal

446
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,700
which is basically least marginal effects and it's also a Gaussian that

447
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,460
effects and it's also a Gaussian that comes later okay

448
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,040
comes later okay again one less interested on Sigma n but

449
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,070
again one less interested on Sigma n but if we want to make that equation to be

450
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,890
if we want to make that equation to be to have an equal sign right it has to

451
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,300
to have an equal sign right it has to look like that this the normalization

452
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:05,400
look like that this the normalization factor and so look at this equation so

453
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,430
factor and so look at this equation so let me just remind you what we compute

454
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,770
let me just remind you what we compute it right what we computed is the mean

455
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,600
it right what we computed is the mean and variance of the alpha methods and

456
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,790
and variance of the alpha methods and the optimises is the filtering

457
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,250
the optimises is the filtering distribution of Z F and the president

458
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,900
distribution of Z F and the president distribution is the probability of Zn

459
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:28,230
distribution is the probability of Zn given the data x1 to X label that okay

460
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,240


461
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,990
so this is the mean alright this is the mean for this filtering distribution can

462
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,670
mean for this filtering distribution can you put this term physical meaning to

463
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:41,470
you put this term physical meaning to Vista question so that if we have some

464
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,810
Vista question so that if we have some physical meaning then you can write the

465
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,120
physical meaning then you can write the equation from intuition rather than

466
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:55,480
equation from intuition rather than algebra so what is a times nu n minus 1

467
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:55,490


468
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:00,020
so you take basically the printing distribution of 10-1

469
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,360
distribution of 10-1 and you push fun with the mean with the

470
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,750
and you push fun with the mean with the transition matrix a you sit up okay

471
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,120
transition matrix a you sit up okay so that's what it is and now we have

472
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,730
so that's what it is and now we have this gain matrix times some error and

473
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,520
this gain matrix times some error and that error is the observation that you

474
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,160
that error is the observation that you saw suddenly you see data that's your

475
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,640
saw suddenly you see data that's your observational time n right and what is C

476
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,480
observational time n right and what is C a mule and - you just told me that

477
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:30,650
a mule and - you just told me that a mu n minus 1 is this transy is pushing

478
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,290
a mu n minus 1 is this transy is pushing forward the previous mean with the

479
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,200
forward the previous mean with the transition matrix a so what is G times a

480
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,670
transition matrix a so what is G times a new n minus 1 it's got no observation on

481
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,250
new n minus 1 it's got no observation on that you will have and this is really

482
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,770
that you will have and this is really the other what to do and effectively

483
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,550
the other what to do and effectively before you have a landing matrix which

484
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,460
before you have a landing matrix which is this common gain matrix right so k

485
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,390
is this common gain matrix right so k times this error plus the first pair

486
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,390
times this error plus the first pair gives you the new updated mean and

487
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:03,110
gives you the new updated mean and that's right out okay first you know

488
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,350
that's right out okay first you know this is easy to remember but you do not

489
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,090
this is easy to remember but you do not remember that actually the exact

490
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,700
remember that actually the exact learning matrix this gain matrix is

491
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,550
learning matrix this gain matrix is given by anything like that but you know

492
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,290
given by anything like that but you know what at the end of the days we know for

493
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,390
what at the end of the days we know for stochastic optimization it doesn't

494
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,640
stochastic optimization it doesn't really matter in other ways if you put

495
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,320
really matter in other ways if you put something else and you start iterating

496
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,910
something else and you start iterating you will give the right answer straining

497
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,370
you will give the right answer straining waste okay but if we want to do things

498
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,620
waste okay but if we want to do things exactly and this is how the name looks

499
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,940
exactly and this is how the name looks of the variance and house here you need

500
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,220
of the variance and house here you need to start the algorithm and swiftly take

501
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,380
to start the algorithm and swiftly take the rest is passing on the first step

502
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,010
the rest is passing on the first step the first message basically requires the

503
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,470
the first message basically requires the initial state to the probability of Z 1

504
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,910
initial state to the probability of Z 1 times the first measurement that you do

505
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:50,450
times the first measurement that you do so this is our first P of Z 1 this is

506
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,650
so this is our first P of Z 1 this is the emission

507
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,880
the emission of x1 okay so if you plug in actually

508
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,490
of x1 okay so if you plug in actually following the same ones are blessed or

509
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,950
following the same ones are blessed or messes passing its to through to the

510
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,300
messes passing its to through to the algebra because you don't have any

511
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,270
algebra because you don't have any integral anything like that here is muon

512
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,300
integral anything like that here is muon and here is v1 and the constants to our

513
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,540
and here is v1 and the constants to our scanner like that okay so you have a way

514
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,780
scanner like that okay so you have a way to start the algorithm and and then if

515
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,670
to start the algorithm and and then if you use the update formulas and that's

516
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:21,510
you use the update formulas and that's the come up into the questions and done

517
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,390
the come up into the questions and done okay in you know in a few minutes we

518
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,490
okay in you know in a few minutes we basically finished with a color filter

519
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:34,050
basically finished with a color filter questions using ideas of masters party

520
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:34,060


521
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:39,010
just a mini are sort of a graphical representation of the way that you

522
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,470
representation of the way that you compute this printing distributions so I

523
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:45,070
compute this printing distributions so I think and I think this is how we derive

524
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,110
think and I think this is how we derive these things last week so this is the

525
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,780
these things last week so this is the printing distribution of n minus 1 then

526
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:57,090
printing distribution of n minus 1 then you use the transition model basically

527
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,890
you use the transition model basically defined by this probability of Zn given

528
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:03,520
defined by this probability of Zn given Zn minus 1 so you update basically

529
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,310
Zn minus 1 so you update basically interstate is the end still using the

530
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,980
interstate is the end still using the measurements from x1 to xn minus 1 so

531
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,280
measurements from x1 to xn minus 1 so this is like an accretion model and the

532
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,770
this is like an accretion model and the values of this dictates basically a

533
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:20,740
values of this dictates basically a distribution that has is much wider in

534
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,460
distribution that has is much wider in support from the splintering stage at n

535
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,330
support from the splintering stage at n minus 1 and then effectively what to get

536
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,220
minus 1 and then effectively what to get the filtering state at time n you

537
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,920
the filtering state at time n you basically have to multiply with the

538
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,410
basically have to multiply with the observation model ok that looks like

539
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,600
observation model ok that looks like this and eventually this very broad

540
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,180
this and eventually this very broad push forward apply for one step

541
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,420
push forward apply for one step predicting this position now is modified

542
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,390
predicting this position now is modified to give you to give you this good

543
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,330
to give you to give you this good distribution that is the

544
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:57,170
distribution that is the take the time that so basically again

545
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:02,370
take the time that so basically again one-step prediction you know ahead and

546
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:06,420
one-step prediction you know ahead and then you collect the measurement accent

547
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,140
then you collect the measurement accent and you update with this model for a

548
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,600
and you update with this model for a minute efficiency it gives you and you

549
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,790
minute efficiency it gives you and you get the right to talk alright so now we

550
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,730
get the right to talk alright so now we have to discuss the backward message

551
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,800
have to discuss the backward message passing I wanna do this fast because

552
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,300
passing I wanna do this fast because basically the question is look the same

553
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,870
basically the question is look the same okay you will only be interested from

554
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,990
okay you will only be interested from this backward passing for getting this

555
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,210
this backward passing for getting this smoothing equations but I don't think I

556
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,810
smoothing equations but I don't think I cover or maybe it was in last two

557
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,630
cover or maybe it was in last two seconds from the previous lecture so we

558
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:42,240
seconds from the previous lecture so we need to get the smoothing distributions

559
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,210
need to get the smoothing distributions potential I remind you that we have

560
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,780
potential I remind you that we have defined as gamma messages okay as the

561
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,820
defined as gamma messages okay as the product of the message is coming at each

562
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,550
product of the message is coming at each node so the product of alpha and beta

563
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,790
node so the product of alpha and beta and this gamma messages define the

564
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,620
and this gamma messages define the sufficient statistics that we need of

565
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,700
sufficient statistics that we need of the EM algorithm

566
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,520
the EM algorithm okay and we were breaking discussed me

567
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,280
okay and we were breaking discussed me in one word

568
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,350
in one word well today all right so the debate looks

569
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,170
well today all right so the debate looks like that we basically have to go

570
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,030
like that we basically have to go backward we'd have to start to the last

571
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,250
backward we'd have to start to the last so ten plus one to complete the master

572
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:18,100
so ten plus one to complete the master then I have defined exactly the message

573
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,570
then I have defined exactly the message here so that this is equality including

574
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,970
here so that this is equality including the closeness of the heft and again you

575
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,700
the closeness of the heft and again you can look back on the previous lecture

576
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,070
can look back on the previous lecture but I had this equation that we

577
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:33,010
but I had this equation that we normalize our normalized form okay this

578
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:39,790
normalize our normalized form okay this is is precisely God so and again what's

579
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,940
is is precisely God so and again what's the meaning of the bigger message is the

580
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,650
the meaning of the bigger message is the probability of sending observations to

581
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:48,160
probability of sending observations to xn plus 1 to x cup the length given that

582
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,580
xn plus 1 to x cup the length given that I started third Zn at some value okay so

583
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:58,540
I started third Zn at some value okay so that's the bit America

584
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:58,550


585
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:02,260
I remember I give you the answer blog but basically what you need to do is

586
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,050
but basically what you need to do is take the since everything is a Gaussian

587
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,580
take the since everything is a Gaussian let me see we're going to assume that

588
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,830
let me see we're going to assume that this bigger message this is a given

589
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:16,830
this bigger message this is a given anywhere

590
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:16,840


591
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:24,209
all right so we have this okay we know that we have that we know that we know

592
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:27,239
that we have that we know that we know the update from the alpha messengers we

593
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:32,249
the update from the alpha messengers we know the skin obviously where I have

594
00:33:32,249 --> 00:33:34,169
know the skin obviously where I have this rather than giving you the little

595
00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:36,839
this rather than giving you the little essence it and actually if it is not in

596
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:39,089
essence it and actually if it is not in the slides maybe that's an external

597
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:41,909
the slides maybe that's an external hormone to the idea of explicitly the

598
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:43,729
hormone to the idea of explicitly the bit of assistance or the bus was moving

599
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:48,810
bit of assistance or the bus was moving color filtering equations okay so this

600
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,849
color filtering equations okay so this peg will I have is the combined message

601
00:33:50,849 --> 00:33:53,339
peg will I have is the combined message Department beta in the derivation but if

602
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:57,119
Department beta in the derivation but if you only use this to compute this beta

603
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,180
you only use this to compute this beta messages thank you good you get this the

604
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,930
messages thank you good you get this the smoothing distributions so what I have

605
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:08,159
smoothing distributions so what I have here is I defined the gamma to be a

606
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,319
here is I defined the gamma to be a Gaussian with mean this new and Hart and

607
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:18,710
Gaussian with mean this new and Hart and V and Hart and you can show by you know

608
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,529
V and Hart and you can show by you know if actually what you need to do is

609
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:24,629
if actually what you need to do is multiply this with an R for instance all

610
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,849
multiply this with an R for instance all right so you can get the Rommel essence

611
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:29,159
right so you can get the Rommel essence of the left and then plug in everything

612
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,680
of the left and then plug in everything you know on the right everything is a

613
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,669
you know on the right everything is a Gaussian and here is the final answer

614
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:38,309
Gaussian and here is the final answer the mean and the variance for the gamma

615
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:41,519
the mean and the variance for the gamma resist is the mean and the variance that

616
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:46,849
resist is the mean and the variance that we computed for the Alpha messages times

617
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:51,599
we computed for the Alpha messages times this are the mean and the variance one

618
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,700
this are the mean and the variance one step ahead right because these are

619
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,900
step ahead right because these are backwards equations minus alpha nu n

620
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,970
backwards equations minus alpha nu n minus P n but we derive it in this

621
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:03,900
minus P n but we derive it in this matrix J and here is given V n times a

622
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,670
matrix J and here is given V n times a transpose B n minus

623
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:10,080
transpose B n minus okay so a very nice equation and I think

624
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,960
okay so a very nice equation and I think bits of the equations actually for the

625
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,990
bits of the equations actually for the carbons moving algorithm if you see in

626
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,910
carbons moving algorithm if you see in the notes basically you will immediately

627
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,740
the notes basically you will immediately recognize what the questions you need to

628
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:27,030
recognize what the questions you need to so coming out of this alright

629
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,730
so coming out of this alright to apply this equations or give you the

630
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,680
to apply this equations or give you the gamma Leicester's obviously you have

631
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,990
gamma Leicester's obviously you have first to run the power of addresses

632
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,930
first to run the power of addresses passing together nu + V and then go

633
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,890
passing together nu + V and then go backwards to calculate gamma okay

634
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:43,920
backwards to calculate gamma okay alright so you have to blossom in

635
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,680
alright so you have to blossom in sequence now there is one more

636
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,570
sequence now there is one more distribution that you need to get on the

637
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:54,090
distribution that you need to get on the air Margaret remember that remember this

638
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:57,150
air Margaret remember that remember this weird distribution the joint

639
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:01,370
weird distribution the joint distribution of Zn minus 1 CL that comes

640
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:04,470
distribution of Zn minus 1 CL that comes with the first one we did it apply the

641
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,760
with the first one we did it apply the hidden order

642
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,600
hidden order am L going from the hmm order okay so we

643
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,260
am L going from the hmm order okay so we will need to compute this joint

644
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,470
will need to compute this joint distribution for staining of Zn -

645
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,140
distribution for staining of Zn - Rollins yeah all right and there are

646
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,680
Rollins yeah all right and there are multiple ways of doing it you know and

647
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,260
multiple ways of doing it you know and here obviously the most trivial way to

648
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,500
here obviously the most trivial way to do it is to take the masters to derive

649
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,600
do it is to take the masters to derive so no than minus 1 and alpha message

650
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,610
so no than minus 1 and alpha message that the message that I should not beat

651
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,700
that the message that I should not beat up from right and then multiply with the

652
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,470
up from right and then multiply with the transition model and the observation

653
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,120
transition model and the observation model and that will give you this

654
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,470
model and that will give you this distribution so when you plug in all the

655
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,350
distribution so when you plug in all the distributions where it comes out is but

656
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,660
distributions where it comes out is but the joint distribution of Zn minus n CN

657
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:54,780
the joint distribution of Zn minus n CN is nu n minus 1 mu n I remind you these

658
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,520
is nu n minus 1 mu n I remind you these are the means for the gamma messages

659
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,640
are the means for the gamma messages okay and the core audience is J n minus

660
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,460
okay and the core audience is J n minus 1 times these variants of the gamma

661
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,440
1 times these variants of the gamma methods and

662
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,950
methods and the J metrics some priority is given by

663
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:17,839
the J metrics some priority is given by this okay so let me understand that

664
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,130
this okay so let me understand that equations are easy right but you know if

665
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,290
equations are easy right but you know if you think of writing a computer program

666
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,200
you think of writing a computer program that implements this it's basically once

667
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,300
that implements this it's basically once you put their analytical expressions the

668
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,120
you put their analytical expressions the whole algorithm is basically ten lines

669
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,579
whole algorithm is basically ten lines and literally Spain I mean if you search

670
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:34,230
and literally Spain I mean if you search on the web and you download the color

671
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:39,150
on the web and you download the color filter algorithm it's ten lights because

672
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,490
filter algorithm it's ten lights because every do you know the MATLAB knows how

673
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,500
every do you know the MATLAB knows how to manipulate gaussians and you don't

674
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,329
to manipulate gaussians and you don't have to do much you give the exact

675
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,760
have to do much you give the exact expressions and the rest is history

676
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,940
expressions and the rest is history okay I mean they become how we're going

677
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,099
okay I mean they become how we're going to get all these parameters now that we

678
00:37:56,099 --> 00:38:02,280
to get all these parameters now that we got the sufficient statistics for you

679
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,780
got the sufficient statistics for you know with other sufficient statistics

680
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,760
know with other sufficient statistics for this from this gamma messages so I

681
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,819
for this from this gamma messages so I remind you what we need to do and let

682
00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:16,530
remind you what we need to do and let somebody remind me so what we supposed

683
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:26,400
somebody remind me so what we supposed to do yes whether we will we take so the

684
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,170
to do yes whether we will we take so the expectation of what

685
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:32,180


686
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:37,010
the joint log-likelihood so we will take basically there's only like if result

687
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:40,480
basically there's only like if result observations and hidden variables

688
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,099
observations and hidden variables because what's a very easy distribution

689
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:45,500
because what's a very easy distribution right Gaussian basically easy to write

690
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,920
right Gaussian basically easy to write down especially the long and because we

691
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,839
down especially the long and because we don't know z we will take the

692
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:53,180
don't know z we will take the expectation of that with respect to the

693
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,460
expectation of that with respect to the posterior of the Samadhi

694
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,900
posterior of the Samadhi so rather than a step to do that

695
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,790
so rather than a step to do that computation with all the parameters

696
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:02,240
computation with all the parameters fixed are variously to all and then once

697
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,410
fixed are variously to all and then once we compute out so that we prepare to be

698
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,079
we compute out so that we prepare to be sufficient statistics because that

699
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,829
sufficient statistics because that expectation with respect to the

700
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:15,260
expectation with respect to the posterior of Z right will acquire the

701
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,109
posterior of Z right will acquire the mean of Z and you know the C variables

702
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:21,290
mean of Z and you know the C variables that we saw before so that's part of the

703
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:25,550
that we saw before so that's part of the step and in the m-step basically we are

704
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:28,190
step and in the m-step basically we are going to take derivatives with respect

705
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,980
going to take derivatives with respect to the theta parameters and will provide

706
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,319
to the theta parameters and will provide update and the three parameters here are

707
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:36,500
update and the three parameters here are sort of elastic because we have one two

708
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,650
sort of elastic because we have one two three four five matrices in one vector

709
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:43,309
three four five matrices in one vector okay the next thing is you will see that

710
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:46,190
okay the next thing is you will see that the equations actually decouple and in

711
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,880
the equations actually decouple and in almost in a trivial way they look like

712
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,710
almost in a trivial way they look like I'm making a lot of these matrices like

713
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,040
I'm making a lot of these matrices like the covariances like you know gamma and

714
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,410
the covariances like you know gamma and Sigma you will see that it looks almost

715
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:03,589
Sigma you will see that it looks almost like working with estimating the mean

716
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:05,690
like working with estimating the mean and the variance of a multivariate

717
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,630
and the variance of a multivariate Gaussian so basically doing Emily

718
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,339
Gaussian so basically doing Emily estimate for the multivariate Gaussian

719
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:12,859
estimate for the multivariate Gaussian and as you know what you do Emily you

720
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:14,359
and as you know what you do Emily you basically get the sample mean of the

721
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:20,540
basically get the sample mean of the sample variance okay so this is the

722
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,430
sample variance okay so this is the sufficient statistic that we need right

723
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,349
sufficient statistic that we need right the expectation of Zn

724
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:28,010
the expectation of Zn we already completed it

725
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:28,020


726
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:35,859
we need the this remember this joint thinks you know

727
00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:37,630
this remember this joint thinks you know we need the expectation of Z and Z and

728
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,450
we need the expectation of Z and Z and minus one post post so you can since you

729
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:44,500
minus one post post so you can since you know the distribution of the joint the

730
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,890
know the distribution of the joint the joint distribution of z LZ at minus 1

731
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:50,950
joint distribution of z LZ at minus 1 this will be the body also that this

732
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:51,790
this will be the body also that this relation

733
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,450
relation - unit responds and then of course you

734
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,970
- unit responds and then of course you will need the expectation of TN z and

735
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,100
will need the expectation of TN z and transpose that is given like that and

736
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,609
transpose that is given like that and all of these parties we just computed

737
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:05,020
all of these parties we just computed all right so this will be can be sort of

738
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,120
all right so this will be can be sort of that in the aesthetic

739
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,000
that in the aesthetic so the not like equal to it's a trivial

740
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,990
so the not like equal to it's a trivial because you know you have the initial

741
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,820
because you know you have the initial observation model I mean the initial

742
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:20,220
observation model I mean the initial state model and then the transition and

743
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:25,630
state model and then the transition and the measurement and these are gaussians

744
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,850
the measurement and these are gaussians so we'll take long substring just

745
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,800
so we'll take long substring just simplify the trivial matter

746
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,070
simplify the trivial matter so this is what we need to compute need

747
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,160
so this is what we need to compute need to take the joint of likelihood and take

748
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,010
to take the joint of likelihood and take the expectation with respect to

749
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,349
the expectation with respect to parameters are showing the expectation

750
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:43,690
parameters are showing the expectation with respect to the z variables keeping

751
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:47,620
with respect to the z variables keeping the parameters fixed so let's do sort of

752
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,770
the parameters fixed so let's do sort of a trivial application of this to

753
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:53,080
a trivial application of this to computing new 0 and p 0 i remind you

754
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,349
computing new 0 and p 0 i remind you those are the mean and variance for the

755
00:41:56,349 --> 00:42:00,370
those are the mean and variance for the initial state okay so basically in that

756
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:02,380
initial state okay so basically in that preparation of the joint of likelihood

757
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,060
preparation of the joint of likelihood only this term will give the

758
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,830
only this term will give the contribution for the involved in here 0

759
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:09,340
contribution for the involved in here 0 0 and really I mean estimating easier to

760
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,099
0 and really I mean estimating easier to 0 is like an Emily for multivariate

761
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:16,240
0 is like an Emily for multivariate Gaussian right I mean it's identical

762
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,630
Gaussian right I mean it's identical okay so when you write you expand this

763
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,910
okay so when you write you expand this this is what you get right

764
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:26,349
this is what you get right the only difference from doing Emily of

765
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:28,450
the only difference from doing Emily of multi-value Gaussian here is an

766
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,220
multi-value Gaussian here is an expectation with respect to the Z

767
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,590
expectation with respect to the Z variables so you notice the expectation

768
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,250
variables so you notice the expectation with involved

769
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,640
with involved you know z1 transposing one in also

770
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,220
you know z1 transposing one in also expectation of Z 1 verse of the

771
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,530
expectation of Z 1 verse of the sufficient statistic that I saw before

772
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:46,840
sufficient statistic that I saw before so z1 expectation of Z 1 and Z ones you

773
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,190
so z1 expectation of Z 1 and Z ones you want to expose so you have altered and

774
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:57,040
want to expose so you have altered and so when so these are the statistics you

775
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,880
so when so these are the statistics you need to compute okay and in the end step

776
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,530
need to compute okay and in the end step four is the maximization with respect to

777
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:09,880
four is the maximization with respect to the 0 and p 0 which the same thing as

778
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,890
the 0 and p 0 which the same thing as have antiviral gaussian and basically

779
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,360
have antiviral gaussian and basically these are the results that you get

780
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,950
these are the results that you get okay so the the updates of the main and

781
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:20,560
okay so the the updates of the main and the valiant are given basically actually

782
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,150
the valiant are given basically actually in terms of the sufficient statistics

783
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:28,720
in terms of the sufficient statistics because I mean this destructive expected

784
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,290
because I mean this destructive expected result here ok these are again like the

785
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,360
result here ok these are again like the sample mean right and this is like the

786
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,780
sample mean right and this is like the sample body right the expectations them

787
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:43,210
sample body right the expectations them so far of something okay

788
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:44,530
so far of something okay very fast you know if you want to

789
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,490
very fast you know if you want to calculate for example a and gamma okay

790
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:50,710
calculate for example a and gamma okay you need to expand this term so to

791
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,150
you need to expand this term so to expand it you can get something like

792
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:52,630
expand it you can get something like this

793
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:57,250
this alright and you complete your sufficient

794
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,050
alright and you complete your sufficient statistics then we take derivatives with

795
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:01,390
statistics then we take derivatives with respect to a and gamma the game it looks

796
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,880
respect to a and gamma the game it looks identical to multivariate Gaussian you

797
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,140
identical to multivariate Gaussian you know and be obtained of a and gamma in

798
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,780
know and be obtained of a and gamma in the m-step look like this really the

799
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,000
the m-step look like this really the only thing you need to compute again is

800
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,310
only thing you need to compute again is the sufficient statistics okay

801
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:18,640
the sufficient statistics okay and the sufficient statistics for a and

802
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,450
and the sufficient statistics for a and gamma obviously they involve all the

803
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:24,220
gamma obviously they involve all the sufficient statistics overall little

804
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:28,030
sufficient statistics overall little left right so you don't have you know in

805
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:32,230
left right so you don't have you know in this case all right well as suppose in

806
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:35,170
this case all right well as suppose in the previous case for the initial state

807
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,529
the previous case for the initial state you didn't have this

808
00:44:36,529 --> 00:44:39,019
you didn't have this relations but here basically without the

809
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:41,179
relations but here basically without the summations that you need to make this to

810
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:50,559
summations that you need to make this to go in similarly for this calculation of

811
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,650
go in similarly for this calculation of Sigma of Z and Sigma that they come in

812
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:59,209
Sigma of Z and Sigma that they come in the observation model again mr. Fisher's

813
00:44:59,209 --> 00:45:05,739
the observation model again mr. Fisher's for distinct look like this okay and

814
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:05,749


815
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:16,299
actually you can see immediately why we had caused the end to be sort of to be

816
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:16,309


817
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:23,750
what's the name we gave to the N I forgot remind me

818
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:23,760


819
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:32,720
say the word but for that I'm tired you know I am justified you know with the

820
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:38,170
know I am justified you know with the world that's nice amenity responsibility

821
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,160
world that's nice amenity responsibility okay

822
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,510
okay similarly the concept of the

823
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,460
similarly the concept of the responsibility because you know you

824
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,140
responsibility because you know you completing C and if you take all the day

825
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,599
completing C and if you take all the day all the observations but you sign a

826
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,550
all the observations but you sign a posterior probability to each of them

827
00:45:49,550 --> 00:46:04,970
posterior probability to each of them right you know estimate basically the

828
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,490
right you know estimate basically the only thing you need to do is when you're

829
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,609
only thing you need to do is when you're going and finish the equation when

830
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:13,970
going and finish the equation when you're going to compute this expectation

831
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,530
you're going to compute this expectation the joint of likelihood the only thing

832
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:18,440
the joint of likelihood the only thing you have to do is write one put some log

833
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,900
you have to do is write one put some log of the prior probability there as well

834
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,330
of the prior probability there as well and the rest is service it will change

835
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:27,349
and the rest is service it will change any between in the derivative to get

836
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:29,540
any between in the derivative to get some extra terms the doctors regular

837
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,030
some extra terms the doctors regular license basically but getting the map

838
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:38,230
license basically but getting the map estimate is sort of trivial now again

839
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:42,770
estimate is sort of trivial now again this thinks they look like comma type of

840
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:45,080
this thinks they look like comma type of problems but you know as you can see you

841
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,530
problems but you know as you can see you know former promised you know there were

842
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:51,050
know former promised you know there were lots of progress on the spending habits

843
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,780
lots of progress on the spending habits how would this work you know they were

844
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:57,250
how would this work you know they were things done in the last 15-20 years so

845
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:00,140
things done in the last 15-20 years so this a nice reference that contains this

846
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:04,670
this a nice reference that contains this sort of calculation

847
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:04,680


848
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:12,930
okay I'm losing my audience what's happening today it's like I'm telling

849
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,600
happening today it's like I'm telling that back for two minutes and then

850
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:29,880
that back for two minutes and then everybody's gone if you try to play with

851
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,750
everybody's gone if you try to play with this message passing and and references

852
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,900
this message passing and and references I don't have them here but deny if you

853
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,810
I don't have them here but deny if you search you will find ways of doing this

854
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:42,360
search you will find ways of doing this but let's say that somehow you're not

855
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,820
but let's say that somehow you're not happy with messages that are gaussians

856
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,780
happy with messages that are gaussians right I mean I can you know maybe you're

857
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,940
right I mean I can you know maybe you're nice model is not Gaussian maybe your

858
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,160
nice model is not Gaussian maybe your initials trade is non Gaussian so how do

859
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,600
initials trade is non Gaussian so how do you use this equation let's say well

860
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,750
you use this equation let's say well this is a Gaussian mixture okay now if

861
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:01,670
this is a Gaussian mixture okay now if business a Gaussian makes the right and

862
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,300
business a Gaussian makes the right and there's the time put here okay xn given

863
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:12,210
there's the time put here okay xn given Zn so you start with say with the

864
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:16,410
Zn so you start with say with the methods of a z1 that is a Gaussian

865
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:21,360
methods of a z1 that is a Gaussian mixture then a of z2 will be also mixed

866
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,900
mixture then a of z2 will be also mixed with K square components basically it

867
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,150
with K square components basically it would be a Gaussian mixed with K cubed

868
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,340
would be a Gaussian mixed with K cubed components so basically you know

869
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,230
components so basically you know identical dilatory explosion in

870
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:34,050
identical dilatory explosion in components of these messages so the only

871
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:38,730
components of these messages so the only way that you can pursue sort of a non

872
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:40,650
way that you can pursue sort of a non Gaussian representation gives an extra

873
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:43,260
Gaussian representation gives an extra sphere would be to actually take

874
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,690
sphere would be to actually take different listeners with this mixtures

875
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,030
different listeners with this mixtures but before you update and you go to the

876
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,340
but before you update and you go to the next clip projecting back to K

877
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,070
next clip projecting back to K components so your new combinations of K

878
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:55,110
components so your new combinations of K square components but then you know

879
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:56,970
square components but then you know perhaps made this again with case J

880
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,990
perhaps made this again with case J component and

881
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:00,000


882
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,750
the wristwatch remember out of the group at MIT that had done this type of

883
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:10,760
at MIT that had done this type of calculations many 10 years course oh so

884
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,000
calculations many 10 years course oh so basically yes gaussians make this update

885
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,920
basically yes gaussians make this update progress analytical but you know if you

886
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,690
progress analytical but you know if you want to use anything that's long

887
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:24,260
want to use anything that's long Gaussian ignoring new territories and

888
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,550
Gaussian ignoring new territories and you have to be very careful how you do

889
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:26,510
you have to be very careful how you do okay

890
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:28,040
okay it doesn't mean you cannot be done what

891
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:33,650
it doesn't mean you cannot be done what he means is not going to be easy to

892
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:49,490
he means is not going to be easy to compute this topic is related with this

893
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,920
compute this topic is related with this type of exchange extensions when the

894
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,140
type of exchange extensions when the messages are non Gaussian how do you

895
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:57,740
messages are non Gaussian how do you actually okay is there are other any

896
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,910
actually okay is there are other any other methods okay

897
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:02,180
other methods okay and one of the methods that allows you

898
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,310
and one of the methods that allows you to do messages that they are non

899
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:07,040
to do messages that they are non Gaussian is to use a particle

900
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,040
Gaussian is to use a particle representation of the of the vestiges so

901
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:14,240
representation of the of the vestiges so you can figure out basically having the

902
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,750
you can figure out basically having the messages represented in terms of top box

903
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:22,250
messages represented in terms of top box alright and I know in the cola gave at

904
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,440
alright and I know in the cola gave at least three or four lectures of the

905
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,530
least three or four lectures of the topics are not quite sure how much you

906
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:31,010
topics are not quite sure how much you will be for us to discuss a lot of

907
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,350
will be for us to discuss a lot of details right somewhere try to spend

908
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:36,530
details right somewhere try to spend maybe 10 minutes okay because this maps

909
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:38,180
maybe 10 minutes okay because this maps are extremely powerful like for example

910
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:43,310
are extremely powerful like for example in robotics in tackling everything is

911
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:46,250
in robotics in tackling everything is using particle methods because those

912
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,820
using particle methods because those emissions long work gaussians are the

913
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,160
emissions long work gaussians are the wrong approach equation so the only way

914
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,620
wrong approach equation so the only way out is time approximation method or

915
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:59,020
out is time approximation method or using this part of things okay

916
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:03,250
using this part of things okay now I know about the 10th of the class -

917
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,740
now I know about the 10th of the class - good luck with my you know attending my

918
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,359
good luck with my you know attending my lectures in the hole

919
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,940
lectures in the hole but I also test that the remember

920
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,589
but I also test that the remember nothing okay

921
00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:18,609
nothing okay right you sick they remember absolutely

922
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:22,829
right you sick they remember absolutely nothing so let me so I'm not going to

923
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,849
nothing so let me so I'm not going to let me jump okay

924
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,140
let me jump okay sorry I'm not going to tell you

925
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:31,470
sorry I'm not going to tell you everything

926
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:31,480


927
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:44,890
alright so me discuss sort of this prediction and update of the state that

928
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:48,279
prediction and update of the state that we use basically for the Kalman filter

929
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:50,440
we use basically for the Kalman filter equations of the previous lectures and

930
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,170
equations of the previous lectures and when I show here is rather than of

931
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:57,339
when I show here is rather than of making one state at the time they think

932
00:51:57,339 --> 00:52:00,640
making one state at the time they think so in this case from the Stefan versus

933
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,490
so in this case from the Stefan versus prediction I have data from 1 to n minus

934
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,839
prediction I have data from 1 to n minus 1 all right

935
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:07,029
1 all right and I'm updating all the states

936
00:52:07,029 --> 00:52:09,640
and I'm updating all the states including our state n and the addition

937
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,609
including our state n and the addition of the prediction step is the end of

938
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:15,880
of the prediction step is the end of this distribution at the joint of Z's

939
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,510
this distribution at the joint of Z's from 1 to N minus 1 given X 1 n minus 1

940
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:22,510
from 1 to N minus 1 given X 1 n minus 1 so this prediction one step ahead only

941
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:27,730
so this prediction one step ahead only involves lives of these dynamics the

942
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:30,490
involves lives of these dynamics the probability of Zn given Zn minus 1 okay

943
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:34,630
probability of Zn given Zn minus 1 okay right so again in for the filtering a

944
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:37,089
right so again in for the filtering a question the prediction step involving

945
00:52:37,089 --> 00:52:40,299
question the prediction step involving the variables here here just because I

946
00:52:40,299 --> 00:52:42,519
the variables here here just because I company's equations for much more

947
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:45,779
company's equations for much more general sort of type of calculations I

948
00:52:45,779 --> 00:52:48,400
general sort of type of calculations I demonstrate this when we keep the

949
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,289
demonstrate this when we keep the posterior of all of these variables ok

950
00:52:50,289 --> 00:52:52,630
posterior of all of these variables ok so this is the prediction for one step

951
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:56,470
so this is the prediction for one step ahead that we have seen and and as we

952
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:59,049
ahead that we have seen and and as we discussed even today if you want now if

953
00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:00,290
discussed even today if you want now if you observe want you

954
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:03,080
you observe want you the point xn and you want to update the

955
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,810
the point xn and you want to update the prospero of all the Z's up to n then

956
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,430
prospero of all the Z's up to n then definitely what you need to do is take

957
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:09,590
definitely what you need to do is take this distribution multiplied with the

958
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:13,820
this distribution multiplied with the observation model xn given Zn so in a

959
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:17,150
observation model xn given Zn so in a particle that metals so if you you know

960
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,220
particle that metals so if you you know make all of this delusion then you get

961
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:26,660
make all of this delusion then you get that these filter equations ok because

962
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,330
that these filter equations ok because here I don't have all my observations on

963
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,790
here I don't have all my observations on each sub to help ok so you get the color

964
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:38,870
each sub to help ok so you get the color of entry questions for this so the idea

965
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:42,770
of entry questions for this so the idea of this particle levels are asking

966
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:45,470
of this particle levels are asking informant in time to represent these

967
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:48,200
informant in time to represent these distributions with samples without

968
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,090
distributions with samples without detection

969
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:55,100
detection ok and somehow another one understanding

970
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,110
ok and somehow another one understanding the distributions as you go from one

971
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:00,250
the distributions as you go from one step to another are provide basically

972
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:05,420
step to another are provide basically the the waves of this Delta functions as

973
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:11,870
the the waves of this Delta functions as you go from n minus 1 to n right

974
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:14,480
you go from n minus 1 to n right so the idea here is that you have Delta

975
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,330
so the idea here is that you have Delta functions but in shall we do class some

976
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:19,130
functions but in shall we do class some of the Cardinal the weight is the same

977
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:22,670
of the Cardinal the weight is the same so we're going to have weighted samples

978
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:25,910
so we're going to have weighted samples to express these distributions and if

979
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:27,710
to express these distributions and if your I these distributions in terms of

980
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,540
your I these distributions in terms of samples you can actually in principle

981
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,060
samples you can actually in principle represent any sort of distributions can

982
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,830
represent any sort of distributions can be anything all right

983
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,990
be anything all right anything that the distribution is very

984
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:39,380
anything that the distribution is very complex you will need more samples but

985
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:45,860
complex you will need more samples but this ideas here it comes out that if you

986
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:48,650
this ideas here it comes out that if you take the samples and somehow you update

987
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,230
take the samples and somehow you update are ways to one step to another the

988
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:54,410
are ways to one step to another the algoriphagus the complexity that depends

989
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:56,060
algoriphagus the complexity that depends the area or the number of the samples

990
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:59,030
the area or the number of the samples not on the little n so in principle you

991
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,490
not on the little n so in principle you can keep doing this forever you can

992
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:02,670
can keep doing this forever you can control us

993
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:05,250
control us distribution from time while 2 to

994
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:07,830
distribution from time while 2 to infinity even though there would be the

995
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,450
infinity even though there would be the generous issues and all the things that

996
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:16,050
generous issues and all the things that we have no time to discuss ok give you

997
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:19,440
we have no time to discuss ok give you basically I'm actually I'm going to go

998
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,770
basically I'm actually I'm going to go directly on the picture okay since we

999
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:32,640
directly on the picture okay since we Vista so so we have here is the mountain

1000
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,520
Vista so so we have here is the mountain the define them and we know the temple

1001
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,620
the define them and we know the temple in distribution and I write the specter

1002
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,570
in distribution and I write the specter in distribution in terms of this

1003
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,550
in distribution in terms of this particle service event the functions

1004
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:45,750
particle service event the functions that are you know sentient basically on

1005
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:49,530
that are you know sentient basically on this part it was capital of Z n okay and

1006
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:54,030
this part it was capital of Z n okay and this are wage okay in the way it's

1007
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,830
this are wage okay in the way it's actually when I represent this are the

1008
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:59,250
actually when I represent this are the particles a different location and to

1009
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,920
particles a different location and to indicate which way it's a bigger

1010
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:08,670
indicate which way it's a bigger basically it's a bigger okay so to be

1011
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:11,430
basically it's a bigger okay so to be able to move forward this particles and

1012
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:13,890
able to move forward this particles and compute the filtering distribution time

1013
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:17,130
compute the filtering distribution time n plus 1 you remember I need to do two

1014
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,680
n plus 1 you remember I need to do two things first I need to move most fair

1015
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,940
things first I need to move most fair which with this dynamical model and then

1016
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,870
which with this dynamical model and then I need to apply the observation the

1017
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:30,780
I need to apply the observation the emission probabilities P of X given Z so

1018
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,870
emission probabilities P of X given Z so the variability is assuming that you

1019
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:36,840
the variability is assuming that you have this particle distribution if you

1020
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,640
have this particle distribution if you take this update equations other hands

1021
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,020
take this update equations other hands before alright and if you apply the

1022
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,540
before alright and if you apply the levity update equation somewhere I have

1023
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,000
levity update equation somewhere I have an update equation what is it here this

1024
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,820
an update equation what is it here this is the prediction for one step ahead the

1025
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,360
is the prediction for one step ahead the only thing you have to do is take rest

1026
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,790
only thing you have to do is take rest approach in terms of particles and then

1027
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:59,400
approach in terms of particles and then multiply this with the dynamical model

1028
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,780
multiply this with the dynamical model of P of Z L given Zn minus 1 so

1029
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,180
of P of Z L given Zn minus 1 so basically this is what I have done here

1030
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,350
basically this is what I have done here all right I compute

1031
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:11,100
all right I compute the posterior of CN plus one still given

1032
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,890
the posterior of CN plus one still given heaven with only the date of the time

1033
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:14,400
heaven with only the date of the time man

1034
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,870
man so this one required this posterior of

1035
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:21,360
so this one required this posterior of CN plus 1 given at the end and then

1036
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,510
CN plus 1 given at the end and then because you have these Delta functions

1037
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:26,300
because you have these Delta functions this posterior we have to be calculated

1038
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:30,570
this posterior we have to be calculated given its particle I don't know if you

1039
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,550
given its particle I don't know if you can see what you actually get through

1040
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:37,070
can see what you actually get through there is terms of a Gaussian mixture

1041
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:37,080


1042
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:42,480
right you get the Gaussian x2 distribution okay and because we don't

1043
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,310
distribution okay and because we don't like thousand extras what you can do is

1044
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:47,520
like thousand extras what you can do is you can understand all this all right

1045
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,020
you can understand all this all right you can example this and if your sample

1046
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,490
you can example this and if your sample is show that all the new samples

1047
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:56,160
is show that all the new samples basically have equal weight the way you

1048
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,140
basically have equal weight the way you do with Monte Carlo and this little

1049
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,220
do with Monte Carlo and this little squares here little circles for equal

1050
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,470
squares here little circles for equal radius base period of the new samples

1051
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:06,450
radius base period of the new samples that give you this one step ahead

1052
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:09,750
that give you this one step ahead predicted distribution okay so then I

1053
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:13,890
predicted distribution okay so then I took my filtering distribution at time N

1054
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:17,820
took my filtering distribution at time N and I now do one step ahead prediction

1055
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:21,330
and I now do one step ahead prediction with recently and I get this little star

1056
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:25,050
with recently and I get this little star post ok and what remains is to actually

1057
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,750
post ok and what remains is to actually multiply this distribution with the

1058
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:30,090
multiply this distribution with the observation model which is P of X given

1059
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:33,270
observation model which is P of X given Z and if you do that because you have

1060
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:35,100
Z and if you do that because you have this Delta functions the new

1061
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,560
this Delta functions the new distribution will be basically the

1062
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,030
distribution will be basically the effects given each of these particles

1063
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:41,490
effects given each of these particles times this Delta function but you

1064
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:44,250
times this Delta function but you compute it there so you can see the new

1065
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:46,650
compute it there so you can see the new filter in this position the location of

1066
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:48,300
filter in this position the location of the part of this hasn't changed but the

1067
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,550
the part of this hasn't changed but the waste have changed because the weights

1068
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:53,520
waste have changed because the weights now are dictated by the observational

1069
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,060
now are dictated by the observational model of P of X given C

1070
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:57,070


1071
00:58:57,070 --> 00:59:04,710
I know there is too much there to get but I need to tell you about this

1072
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,960
but I need to tell you about this because some of these methods are the

1073
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,000
because some of these methods are the methods that are used in practice

1074
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,910
methods that are used in practice this is how we're gonna implement the

1075
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:12,360
this is how we're gonna implement the trainer

1076
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:16,950
trainer Gaussian models maybe even a linear

1077
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:19,860
Gaussian models maybe even a linear models or unity of non Gaussian noise

1078
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:23,190
models or unity of non Gaussian noise you know this meant was work and they

1079
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,290
you know this meant was work and they are sort of the standard methods for

1080
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:28,220
are sort of the standard methods for implementing lists of data questions in

1081
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:31,200
implementing lists of data questions in many areas all right

1082
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:39,600
many areas all right many are okay I'm actually with the bad

1083
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:44,490
many are okay I'm actually with the bad reasons I have committed to give I don't

1084
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:47,010
reasons I have committed to give I don't know how many lectures this summer in

1085
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:48,660
know how many lectures this summer in another university on the top of this

1086
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,090
another university on the top of this type of metals so if you are interested

1087
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:54,420
type of metals so if you are interested I will try to sort of prepare specific

1088
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:57,030
I will try to sort of prepare specific notes from scotts basically for this

1089
00:59:57,030 --> 01:00:00,990
notes from scotts basically for this part of into methods maybe by by

1090
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:04,170
part of into methods maybe by by mid-june or so okay so what a wise you

1091
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:05,970
mid-june or so okay so what a wise you can look at the notes from the course

1092
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:07,950
can look at the notes from the course last semester that contains more

1093
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:12,240
last semester that contains more information any questions to this at

1094
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,180
information any questions to this at least in spirit what they are I mean the

1095
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:18,810
least in spirit what they are I mean the whole idea is I represent the

1096
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:20,070
whole idea is I represent the distributions the splintering

1097
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:22,860
distributions the splintering distributions in terms of samples right

1098
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:26,790
distributions in terms of samples right and a distribution in terms of samples

1099
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,330
and a distribution in terms of samples is a bunch of Delta functions all right

1100
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,950
is a bunch of Delta functions all right if you just need these are depending how

1101
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:34,440
if you just need these are depending how we do the sampling to know if the

1102
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:38,370
we do the sampling to know if the weights are equal or they are different

1103
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:43,380
weights are equal or they are different okay and so in this case you start with

1104
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,360
okay and so in this case you start with so when we see some of the start with

1105
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,460
so when we see some of the start with bigger than others the weights different

1106
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,250
bigger than others the weights different but if you sample from this you notice

1107
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:54,180
but if you sample from this you notice like this sample that has degrade as you

1108
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:58,500
like this sample that has degrade as you sample it gives you two children by just

1109
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,880
sample it gives you two children by just the idea because there's no worry okay

1110
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,980
the idea because there's no worry okay but it's not the new samples all of them

1111
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:08,270
but it's not the new samples all of them have now equal way okay and then this is

1112
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,430
have now equal way okay and then this is your observation model so obviously

1113
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:12,650
your observation model so obviously these samples for example here when we

1114
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:14,180
these samples for example here when we passed and prove this observation model

1115
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:17,390
passed and prove this observation model we have bigger weight and again here we

1116
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:19,400
we have bigger weight and again here we have bigger weights of they're small and

1117
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,430
have bigger weights of they're small and so this is sort of a very powerful way

1118
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:26,990
so this is sort of a very powerful way to do something to do small thing to

1119
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:29,090
to do something to do small thing to there are lots of different type of

1120
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:31,580
there are lots of different type of things and then the standard levels as I

1121
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:36,830
things and then the standard levels as I said in robotics in in any sort of

1122
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:38,420
said in robotics in in any sort of dynamical problems not on your body

1123
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:42,200
dynamical problems not on your body touching anything all right

1124
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:46,060
touching anything all right we have a few minutes left so let me

1125
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:49,370
we have a few minutes left so let me Pacific how show you can finish this

1126
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:54,950
Pacific how show you can finish this topic how you extend this ideas when the

1127
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:59,840
topic how you extend this ideas when the model is not linear all right so so we

1128
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,430
model is not linear all right so so we had two linear models right both the

1129
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:05,990
had two linear models right both the dynamics it was for the Z you know

1130
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:08,630
dynamics it was for the Z you know remember Z n equal a Z n minus 1 plus

1131
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:12,590
remember Z n equal a Z n minus 1 plus noise let's say that the relation is not

1132
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:14,990
noise let's say that the relation is not linear then we basically have the N

1133
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:18,740
linear then we basically have the N minus 1 goes to some linear function f

1134
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:24,380
minus 1 goes to some linear function f of X to give me to give me Z n okay you

1135
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:28,640
of X to give me to give me Z n okay you can do this you know in in instead of

1136
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,890
can do this you know in in instead of the matrix a or you can have something

1137
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:33,530
the matrix a or you can have something like that to represent noise okay but

1138
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:36,950
like that to represent noise okay but the bottom line is the relation we have

1139
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:42,500
the bottom line is the relation we have between variables at n minus 1 and n all

1140
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,990
between variables at n minus 1 and n all between the state and the observations

1141
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:47,690
between the state and the observations in the given time they're coupled to

1142
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:50,390
in the given time they're coupled to some nonlinear function and so we need

1143
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:55,160
some nonlinear function and so we need to find some way to deal with it

1144
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:55,170


1145
01:02:55,170 --> 01:03:00,660
in terms of particles you know that's not an issue right so well when I say we

1146
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,400
not an issue right so well when I say we need to find some way to deal with this

1147
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,530
need to find some way to deal with this can we actually want to try the carbon

1148
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,620
can we actually want to try the carbon filter equations to do that okay and the

1149
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:10,610
filter equations to do that okay and the answer of course is yes you can

1150
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:16,740
answer of course is yes you can so yes then this is the trivial model so

1151
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:19,370
so yes then this is the trivial model so let's say the the dynamics are given by

1152
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:23,550
let's say the the dynamics are given by this function G okay and the observation

1153
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,140
this function G okay and the observation model by another nonlinear function

1154
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:29,880
model by another nonlinear function eight okay so the phonology is called

1155
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,330
eight okay so the phonology is called the extended Kalman filter and it's

1156
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:36,720
the extended Kalman filter and it's nothing else but linearization of GNH

1157
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,510
nothing else but linearization of GNH and among the previous state estimates

1158
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:42,240
and among the previous state estimates using basically a Taylor series

1159
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,850
using basically a Taylor series expansion

1160
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:46,920
expansion okay and actually there are versions of

1161
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,160
okay and actually there are versions of this form you can use first on the

1162
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,230
this form you can use first on the Taylor expansion and also a second of

1163
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:54,180
Taylor expansion and also a second of the Pedro expansion you can do anything

1164
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:57,270
the Pedro expansion you can do anything you want to the against once you

1165
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:01,980
you want to the against once you approximate this and you you know if you

1166
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,250
approximate this and you you know if you use the Taylor series expansion will

1167
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,230
use the Taylor series expansion will give you sort of a linear term is a 3-1

1168
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:13,680
give you sort of a linear term is a 3-1 or a near term intensity and so would

1169
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,530
or a near term intensity and so would you sort of a derivative times 90 minus

1170
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:18,540
you sort of a derivative times 90 minus 1 and if you approximate the derivative

1171
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:23,700
1 and if you approximate the derivative of the previous state then the common

1172
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:31,800
of the previous state then the common equation so really it's super fancy bra

1173
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,450
equation so really it's super fancy bra there is really nothing there I think

1174
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:37,380
there is really nothing there I think the equations are sort of in your eyes

1175
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:39,660
the equations are sort of in your eyes and then cut and paste from the only

1176
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:42,210
and then cut and paste from the only questions from the new questions but let

1177
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:46,620
questions from the new questions but let me show you graphically what the idea

1178
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:51,440
me show you graphically what the idea here is so remember we have

1179
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,250
here is so remember we have as some function some running a function

1180
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:58,750
as some function some running a function G of X all right so if X is a Gaussian

1181
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:02,450
G of X all right so if X is a Gaussian the idea is when you compute let's say

1182
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:06,200
the idea is when you compute let's say which Montecarlo y equals G of X you

1183
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,730
which Montecarlo y equals G of X you don't get a Gaussian you get a real

1184
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:10,130
don't get a Gaussian you get a real distribution of usage here so this

1185
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:12,860
distribution of usage here so this bimodal distribution okay so the

1186
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:16,640
bimodal distribution okay so the question is not really neat to do when

1187
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,220
question is not really neat to do when we take a Gaussian and we apply this

1188
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:21,940
we take a Gaussian and we apply this mapping to effects to get the Gaussian

1189
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:27,440
mapping to effects to get the Gaussian right and so the idea for this extended

1190
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,440
right and so the idea for this extended color filter is to do linearization in

1191
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:34,450
color filter is to do linearization in the mode of X ok and then basically

1192
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:36,980
the mode of X ok and then basically alright so this is the approximation we

1193
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:40,190
alright so this is the approximation we do all right and then we pass the

1194
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:44,120
do all right and then we pass the probability we passed this line through

1195
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,400
probability we passed this line through the probability of P of X and that will

1196
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,880
the probability of P of X and that will give me this dotted Gaussian which is

1197
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,700
give me this dotted Gaussian which is the expanding our field of Gaussian that

1198
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,760
the expanding our field of Gaussian that has a mean basically that is given by

1199
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:02,540
has a mean basically that is given by this value here okay so how does the

1200
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:04,970
this value here okay so how does the linearization look like so for example

1201
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:09,860
linearization look like so for example this is the observation order your

1202
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:12,230
this is the observation order your interest first on the table since the

1203
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:17,840
interest first on the table since the question this is the value so we had H

1204
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,150
question this is the value so we had H here right so we is the value is

1205
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:24,650
here right so we is the value is computed at the previous mean okay if

1206
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,150
computed at the previous mean okay if you remember this notation which is near

1207
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:31,250
you remember this notation which is near 50 minus 1 is the main of what

1208
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:34,760
50 minus 1 is the main of what distribution then this is the

1209
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,820
distribution then this is the observationally right so what is mere TT

1210
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:42,080
observationally right so what is mere TT minus 1

1211
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:42,090


1212
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:48,170
how many data have collected through this after 3-1 so this is the main of

1213
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,230
this after 3-1 so this is the main of the one step ahead prolific distribution

1214
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:54,560
the one step ahead prolific distribution okay some approximating age using the

1215
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:57,830
okay some approximating age using the mean plus the derivative at the same

1216
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:01,340
mean plus the derivative at the same location times the error of this one

1217
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:05,150
location times the error of this one have I had in prediction the other if

1218
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:08,210
have I had in prediction the other if you look from the observation Y key okay

1219
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:10,190
you look from the observation Y key okay I don't know why it is white you know

1220
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:12,650
I don't know why it is white you know text but anyways coming forward from

1221
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:14,270
text but anyways coming forward from here of their give us different

1222
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:17,720
here of their give us different equations so so basically they tell us

1223
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:22,640
equations so so basically they tell us this expansion here around the mean of

1224
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,920
this expansion here around the mean of the one hand one step ahead predictive

1225
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:29,600
the one hand one step ahead predictive distribution okay another place there's

1226
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,210
distribution okay another place there's absolutely nothing different from what

1227
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:34,310
absolutely nothing different from what we had before if you remember the linear

1228
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:36,230
we had before if you remember the linear model for coming up integration she goes

1229
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:41,330
model for coming up integration she goes the Gaussian of YT given let's say what

1230
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:44,720
the Gaussian of YT given let's say what was the metrics that we have here you

1231
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,980
was the metrics that we have here you see sometimes right p plus some constant

1232
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:53,210
see sometimes right p plus some constant so the constant is this minus this times

1233
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:56,510
so the constant is this minus this times that okay and of course here I'm

1234
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:58,340
that okay and of course here I'm thinking that the noisiest Gaussian okay

1235
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:00,950
thinking that the noisiest Gaussian okay if the noisiest Gaussian is not Gaussian

1236
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:03,490
if the noisiest Gaussian is not Gaussian basically you have to incorporate things

1237
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:07,640
basically you have to incorporate things in a slightly different form okay

1238
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:12,160
in a slightly different form okay and you know same thing for the

1239
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:16,430
and you know same thing for the evolution of the of the dynamics let's

1240
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,740
evolution of the of the dynamics let's not bother about you all right students

1241
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,780
not bother about you all right students really move it on the previous slide so

1242
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:23,810
really move it on the previous slide so basically you take linear Taylor series

1243
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:30,680
basically you take linear Taylor series expansion around these the previous

1244
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,110
expansion around these the previous night the main of the three stage which

1245
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:35,360
night the main of the three stage which is near t minus one and this is the

1246
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:40,220
is near t minus one and this is the error again times this Jacobian there

1247
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:42,019
error again times this Jacobian there but there's a gradient position Z with

1248
01:08:42,019 --> 01:08:50,059
but there's a gradient position Z with respect to Z I mean you know once you do

1249
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:54,229
respect to Z I mean you know once you do this if you look at your genetic type of

1250
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:56,329
this if you look at your genetic type of simple equations did you cut and paste

1251
01:08:56,329 --> 01:08:57,829
simple equations did you cut and paste on solvers

1252
01:08:57,829 --> 01:09:02,030
on solvers updating that this is your matrix x y

1253
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:04,910
updating that this is your matrix x y this is the constant and the rest is

1254
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:11,920
this is the constant and the rest is very useful okay and if anyone you know

1255
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,229
very useful okay and if anyone you know of notation basically you know if you do

1256
01:09:15,229 --> 01:09:17,479
of notation basically you know if you do this linearization you can get various

1257
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:20,930
this linearization you can get various different versions of this extended

1258
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:23,090
different versions of this extended Kalman filter including what's called

1259
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:26,479
Kalman filter including what's called its innovative dkf if anybody is

1260
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:29,780
its innovative dkf if anybody is interested I can give you to read a very

1261
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:32,510
interested I can give you to read a very nice book by a stonker that I promise

1262
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:34,400
nice book by a stonker that I promise you you can read it in less than three

1263
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,460
you you can read it in less than three hours okay and he has a computer program

1264
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:40,099
hours okay and he has a computer program that comes with it has nothing in the

1265
01:09:40,099 --> 01:09:42,260
that comes with it has nothing in the conditional probability graphical models

1266
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:45,890
conditional probability graphical models but is everything from zero including

1267
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:51,130
but is everything from zero including applications to the most complex sort of

1268
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:54,320
applications to the most complex sort of way for doing some sort of essence of

1269
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,180
way for doing some sort of essence of karma filter if you'll read the book in

1270
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,680
karma filter if you'll read the book in three hours and a minute

1271
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,810
three hours and a minute so if anybody's interested I think it's

1272
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:03,710
so if anybody's interested I think it's online that okay and if you know access

1273
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:05,770
online that okay and if you know access but you can actually reach this Christus

1274
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:08,360
but you can actually reach this Christus that is two or three years before this

1275
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:11,229
that is two or three years before this book okay

1276
01:10:11,229 --> 01:10:18,850
book okay so you can look at those things just six

1277
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:23,229
so you can look at those things just six minutes finis right another algorithm is

1278
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:25,660
minutes finis right another algorithm is the uncertainty column of the table to

1279
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:31,089
the uncertainty column of the table to do TRAI and the idea here is that it is

1280
01:10:31,089 --> 01:10:33,160
do TRAI and the idea here is that it is easier to approximate the Gaussian run

1281
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,229
easier to approximate the Gaussian run the log to approximate the function

1282
01:10:35,229 --> 01:10:39,129
the log to approximate the function so actually one to linear paste the

1283
01:10:39,129 --> 01:10:41,459
so actually one to linear paste the function you tried actually to

1284
01:10:41,459 --> 01:10:45,520
function you tried actually to approximate some data to fit the

1285
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,339
approximate some data to fit the Gaussian so basically don't manipulate

1286
01:10:48,339 --> 01:10:51,069
Gaussian so basically don't manipulate the function trying to make data to fit

1287
01:10:51,069 --> 01:10:54,609
the function trying to make data to fit in some Gaussian point okay and how do

1288
01:10:54,609 --> 01:10:56,669
in some Gaussian point okay and how do you do this

1289
01:10:56,669 --> 01:11:05,410
you do this so here's the idea if the ocean all

1290
01:11:05,410 --> 01:11:07,990
so here's the idea if the ocean all right this is this is the unscented

1291
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:09,669
right this is this is the unscented transport basically that you have to use

1292
01:11:09,669 --> 01:11:11,859
transport basically that you have to use if you have some distribution that fits

1293
01:11:11,859 --> 01:11:14,020
if you have some distribution that fits in the Gaussian and you want to pass

1294
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:17,350
in the Gaussian and you want to pass this to a mapping of the form y equal f

1295
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:19,799
this to a mapping of the form y equal f of X right F is a nonlinear function

1296
01:11:19,799 --> 01:11:22,660
of X right F is a nonlinear function which you need to do is you need to

1297
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:27,299
which you need to do is you need to compute what is called Sigma points and

1298
01:11:27,299 --> 01:11:29,919
compute what is called Sigma points and these are constants basically that you

1299
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:32,080
these are constants basically that you can optimize all right these are the

1300
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,270
can optimize all right these are the columns of the Sigma matrix this is the

1301
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:37,419
columns of the Sigma matrix this is the mean of this G of X so you calculate the

1302
01:11:37,419 --> 01:11:40,240
mean of this G of X so you calculate the Sigma forest and never can do this

1303
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,760
Sigma forest and never can do this you Paskus this Sigma points through the

1304
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,160
you Paskus this Sigma points through the function f and then you fit this data

1305
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:48,750
function f and then you fit this data wise to now sir that's all

1306
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:53,700
wise to now sir that's all so again money relating this function f

1307
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:57,669
so again money relating this function f to give you a linear equation that will

1308
01:11:57,669 --> 01:11:59,919
to give you a linear equation that will lead to a Gaussian with the dress you

1309
01:11:59,919 --> 01:12:05,180
lead to a Gaussian with the dress you introduced this Sigma points okay

1310
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:07,370
introduced this Sigma points okay and in this case they have to D plus 1

1311
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:09,770
and in this case they have to D plus 1 points you pass this through the

1312
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:11,450
points you pass this through the function f and then in through the

1313
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:14,450
function f and then in through the Gaussian so obviously in our case we

1314
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:17,510
Gaussian so obviously in our case we have to do this twice you have to do

1315
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:20,030
have to do this twice you have to do this for the the dynamical model and we

1316
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:22,280
this for the the dynamical model and we have to do this for the observational

1317
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:29,360
have to do this for the observational model and effectively if so if you pass

1318
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,340
model and effectively if so if you pass this through the function and you want

1319
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:32,360
this through the function and you want to compute the mean and the variance

1320
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:36,020
to compute the mean and the variance this the general response okay this

1321
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:39,439
this the general response okay this looks very much like sample mean the

1322
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:41,540
looks very much like sample mean the sample variance the only difference here

1323
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:44,090
sample variance the only difference here is because these points were selected in

1324
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:48,080
is because these points were selected in the some optimal way their weights would

1325
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,060
the some optimal way their weights would not be equal so you know the weights

1326
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,430
not be equal so you know the weights they have to be calculated depending on

1327
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:54,760
they have to be calculated depending on the parameters that you use in the

1328
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:58,760
the parameters that you use in the uncertain transport if you try to do

1329
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:02,420
uncertain transport if you try to do this in one day in case you get inspired

1330
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,670
this in one day in case you get inspired that this reminds you anything the three

1331
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:06,650
that this reminds you anything the three points for example that you're going to

1332
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:09,410
points for example that you're going to use is given Gaussian in one deal with

1333
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:12,470
use is given Gaussian in one deal with mu nu minus square root of 3 times Sigma

1334
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:16,550
mu nu minus square root of 3 times Sigma and mu plus square root of 3 times Sigma

1335
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:23,780
and mu plus square root of 3 times Sigma and the algorithm is again sort of the

1336
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:26,479
and the algorithm is again sort of the first step is we need to predict the one

1337
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:29,600
first step is we need to predict the one hand of step so to compute the filtering

1338
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,090
hand of step so to compute the filtering distribution again right you first have

1339
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:35,600
distribution again right you first have to go one step ahead with observations

1340
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,310
to go one step ahead with observations only after t minus 1 okay so to do this

1341
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:43,840
only after t minus 1 okay so to do this what we have to do is pass the previous

1342
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,550
what we have to do is pass the previous Gaussian distribution the Gaussian

1343
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:49,220
Gaussian distribution the Gaussian approximation we had for the filter and

1344
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:51,770
approximation we had for the filter and distribution of CP minus 1 so what you

1345
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:54,439
distribution of CP minus 1 so what you need to this first this through the

1346
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:56,240
need to this first this through the function G that defines the kinematic

1347
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:59,720
function G that defines the kinematic model right the dynamical model G so

1348
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,290
model right the dynamical model G so basically start with this decline the

1349
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:05,870
basically start with this decline the Sigma points and then pass them to G and

1350
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:08,209
Sigma points and then pass them to G and then to compute the mean of the variance

1351
01:14:08,209 --> 01:14:11,590
then to compute the mean of the variance of that you weight them appropriately

1352
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:13,570
of that you weight them appropriately using the standard formulas from the

1353
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:16,750
using the standard formulas from the insensitive small and you get the mean

1354
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:19,050
insensitive small and you get the mean of the volatility like that and

1355
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:25,080
of the volatility like that and eventually to genetic impedance of this

1356
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:28,330
eventually to genetic impedance of this observation model but is nonlinear okay

1357
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:33,850
observation model but is nonlinear okay so so what you need to miss you need to

1358
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:37,300
so so what you need to miss you need to pass the power of Sigma T that we

1359
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:40,690
pass the power of Sigma T that we completed the previous step there is the

1360
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:43,840
completed the previous step there is the observation London okay so this is what

1361
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:50,050
observation London okay so this is what you get okay and then eventually you are

1362
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:54,490
you get okay and then eventually you are going to have this is sort of a

1363
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,980
going to have this is sort of a likelihood and this is sort of like a

1364
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:59,680
likelihood and this is sort of like a primer so you're going to need to do the

1365
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,780
primer so you're going to need to do the 2013 distribution you will need to use

1366
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:04,180
2013 distribution you will need to use Bayes rule and compute the probability

1367
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:10,390
Bayes rule and compute the probability of Z given Y so if you have nice and and

1368
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:13,000
of Z given Y so if you have nice and and if you have P of Z they're basically

1369
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,460
if you have P of Z they're basically just Vegas truth directly it can give

1370
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:18,820
just Vegas truth directly it can give you the filtering distribution so this

1371
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:20,470
you the filtering distribution so this is just from the formulas for Gaussian

1372
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:25,870
is just from the formulas for Gaussian linear models by noting specific this

1373
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:28,330
linear models by noting specific this once alpha qkf algorithm is basically

1374
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:30,040
once alpha qkf algorithm is basically clever another kind of reasoning is the

1375
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,550
clever another kind of reasoning is the desirable algorithm because have much

1376
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:36,040
desirable algorithm because have much higher accuracy than the linearization

1377
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:40,060
higher accuracy than the linearization that we discussed before okay and the

1378
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:42,250
that we discussed before okay and the objection is you have optimized this

1379
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:44,680
objection is you have optimized this various points don't may be the function

1380
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47,460
various points don't may be the function and you know it's very nice

1381
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:51,130
and you know it's very nice extermination to program you don't have

1382
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,830
extermination to program you don't have to program so you didn't give them any

1383
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:55,390
to program so you didn't give them any hormones to program this right but

1384
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:56,800
hormones to program this right but things maybe you should give them

1385
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,250
things maybe you should give them something worth a download maybe one of

1386
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:04,000
something worth a download maybe one of the algorithms and the play with a

1387
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,040
the algorithms and the play with a tortoise you can plot to see how the

1388
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,250
tortoise you can plot to see how the Pinto

1389
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:10,310
Pinto looks like you know how this malting

1390
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:12,799
looks like you know how this malting distribution looks like and and and the

1391
01:16:12,799 --> 01:16:16,939
distribution looks like and and and the like just to finish the 125 right

1392
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:21,560
like just to finish the 125 right obviously this nebula sound a small part

1393
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,589
obviously this nebula sound a small part of this whole area of data stimulation

1394
01:16:24,589 --> 01:16:27,529
of this whole area of data stimulation right so cue work with dynamical data

1395
01:16:27,529 --> 01:16:29,989
right so cue work with dynamical data you need to know all of the specifics up

1396
01:16:29,989 --> 01:16:32,779
you need to know all of the specifics up and down every single detail because

1397
01:16:32,779 --> 01:16:36,319
and down every single detail because playing with data in time requires that

1398
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:38,719
playing with data in time requires that you do prediction you do small things of

1399
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:42,830
you do prediction you do small things of filtering all right all of the above

1400
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:46,219
filtering all right all of the above okay there are lots of power of new

1401
01:16:46,219 --> 01:16:47,989
okay there are lots of power of new books that are coming out on data

1402
01:16:47,989 --> 01:16:50,989
books that are coming out on data stimulation dressed up with a little bit

1403
01:16:50,989 --> 01:16:53,209
stimulation dressed up with a little bit of mathematics they don't contain

1404
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:55,100
of mathematics they don't contain anything new because this ideas have

1405
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,719
anything new because this ideas have been out there for 20 years

1406
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:00,199
been out there for 20 years okay but people who want right I mean if

1407
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:03,020
okay but people who want right I mean if you want to write a book you know you

1408
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:05,540
you want to write a book you know you can do something on Kalman filtering six

1409
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,859
can do something on Kalman filtering six months okay

1410
01:17:06,859 --> 01:17:08,779
months okay and then someone can read it you know

1411
01:17:08,779 --> 01:17:12,189
and then someone can read it you know how many also to the three hours okay

1412
01:17:12,189 --> 01:17:16,790
how many also to the three hours okay and and always there's something to make
