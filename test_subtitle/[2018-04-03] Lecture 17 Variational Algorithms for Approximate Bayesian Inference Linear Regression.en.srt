1
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:40,649
all right it's 12:30 so let me give you some reminders for the rest of the

2
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:43,770
some reminders for the rest of the semester the presentations for the class

3
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,399
semester the presentations for the class which means the report the six pages

4
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,940
which means the report the six pages report the PowerPoint slides you're all

5
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,440
report the PowerPoint slides you're all a presentation are going to be the last

6
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,850
a presentation are going to be the last three lectures in April okay because

7
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,490
three lectures in April okay because there's from past experience there's no

8
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,490
there's from past experience there's no way we can find another room in May so

9
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,320
way we can find another room in May so they're going to be during the last

10
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,609
they're going to be during the last week's which means plan ahead right

11
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:11,270
week's which means plan ahead right don't stop and say can I be the last

12
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,979
don't stop and say can I be the last because you are being called and you

13
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,150
because you are being called and you will be the first okay and it doesn't go

14
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,270
will be the first okay and it doesn't go first come first serve on this case lost

15
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,820
first come first serve on this case lost time to itself but can you polish which

16
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,120
time to itself but can you polish which means five down here from you your first

17
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,170
means five down here from you your first okay that's one thing the second thing

18
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,479
okay that's one thing the second thing is ie you know we were planning to give

19
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,880
is ie you know we were planning to give you six homeworks and staying there very

20
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,720
you six homeworks and staying there very slow process of even preparing the

21
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,060
slow process of even preparing the solutions of the homeworks

22
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,940
solutions of the homeworks you know I asked stovic to give you a

23
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,819
you know I asked stovic to give you a six homework but also to give you the

24
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,729
six homework but also to give you the solution so you can study them but we

25
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:56,430
solution so you can study them but we won't have to submit at six hormone okay

26
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,440
won't have to submit at six hormone okay I'm not doing this to reward anybody I

27
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,610
I'm not doing this to reward anybody I realized things are not going as the way

28
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,660
realized things are not going as the way I envisioned so I think that's the best

29
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,430
I envisioned so I think that's the best option for everybody all right so what

30
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,290
option for everybody all right so what else

31
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,230
else thank you helps I forgot all right so

32
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,480
thank you helps I forgot all right so what I'm going to do is because we went

33
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,190
what I'm going to do is because we went over literally eight minutes to cover

34
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,990
over literally eight minutes to cover variational inference for linear

35
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,090
variational inference for linear regression I'm going to go back today

36
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,580
regression I'm going to go back today and spend maybe fifteen minutes on the

37
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,390
and spend maybe fifteen minutes on the topic okay and in some sense if you're

38
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,910
topic okay and in some sense if you're not talking about linear regression

39
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,810
not talking about linear regression seeing this in the context of

40
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,110
seeing this in the context of variational algorithms is good because

41
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,610
variational algorithms is good because the results vary they look very close to

42
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,050
the results vary they look very close to the exact inference that you can do for

43
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,860
the exact inference that you can do for this type of problem all right and then

44
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,150
this type of problem all right and then once we're finished with us we will

45
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,410
once we're finished with us we will discuss about the Gaussian mixture

46
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,020
discuss about the Gaussian mixture problem which is mathematically very

47
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,870
problem which is mathematically very more intensive but also way more useful

48
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,250
more intensive but also way more useful and then maybe we'll generalize this to

49
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,600
and then maybe we'll generalize this to sort of any distributions from the

50
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,610
sort of any distributions from the exponential community and next Tuesday

51
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,440
exponential community and next Tuesday we start talking about approximate

52
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,800
we start talking about approximate methods interest methods in graphs in

53
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,830
methods interest methods in graphs in particularly expectation propagation

54
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,110
particularly expectation propagation which is sort of one of the standard

55
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,180
which is sort of one of the standard methods for doing inference in very

56
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,380
methods for doing inference in very complex systems things will get

57
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,530
complex systems things will get progressively more complex okay and you

58
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,810
progressively more complex okay and you may say but this is but this fixes is

59
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,870
may say but this is but this fixes is not machine learning no it is machine

60
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,850
not machine learning no it is machine learning it's not statistics it's not

61
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,710
learning it's not statistics it's not decisions don't know much about this

62
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,630
decisions don't know much about this machine learning people need to know

63
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,710
machine learning people need to know more okay so I'm saying this to avoid

64
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:52,890
more okay so I'm saying this to avoid any comments questions probation

65
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,060
any comments questions probation regression so we basically were given X

66
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,420
regression so we basically were given X Y data if you like pairs of data the Y

67
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,150
Y data if you like pairs of data the Y here is denoted with T so I'm using I

68
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,770
here is denoted with T so I'm using I think the notation is must be from this

69
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,159
think the notation is must be from this report guessing so the integration comes

70
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:14,029
report guessing so the integration comes we write a response t

71
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:17,570
we write a response t NEX there's no beautimous course P for P

72
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,369
NEX there's no beautimous course P for P is a vector basis functions you can

73
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:21,140
is a vector basis functions you can think of this being in one dimension for

74
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,279
think of this being in one dimension for example 1 xx square can be splines can

75
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,010
example 1 xx square can be splines can be regular basis functions can be

76
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,279
be regular basis functions can be anything okay and one side some noise

77
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,049
anything okay and one side some noise and if you write this in a probabilistic

78
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:36,139
and if you write this in a probabilistic form the likelihood for iid data looks

79
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:40,369
form the likelihood for iid data looks like that okay so now to make the

80
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:42,290
like that okay so now to make the analysis simple here I'm going to take

81
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,709
analysis simple here I'm going to take the precision in this model is null and

82
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:47,389
the precision in this model is null and I think they have two or three slides in

83
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,820
I think they have two or three slides in the notes where basically we can remove

84
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,950
the notes where basically we can remove that constrain and it doesn't have

85
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,809
that constrain and it doesn't have really any much difficulty to the

86
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:56,989
really any much difficulty to the problem so in this integration right the

87
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:00,019
problem so in this integration right the idea is we're going to take everything

88
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:06,469
idea is we're going to take everything to be random so W is going to come with

89
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:09,079
to be random so W is going to come with some prior distribution and the prior

90
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,790
some prior distribution and the prior defense of this precision alpha and you

91
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,189
defense of this precision alpha and you know we're going to assume and all the

92
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:18,469
know we're going to assume and all the hyper prior basically pure alpha the

93
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:21,649
hyper prior basically pure alpha the gamma distribution you should know that

94
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,420
gamma distribution you should know that gamma distribution comes all which is a

95
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,809
gamma distribution comes all which is a prior for precision you know every query

96
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:30,399
prior for precision you know every query much similar okay and I think we also

97
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,189
much similar okay and I think we also discussed what you can generalize this

98
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:35,980
discussed what you can generalize this where you make the softest not to be

99
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,749
where you make the softest not to be alpha minus one I but you can put a

100
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:41,059
alpha minus one I but you can put a different alpha in the diagonal of the

101
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:43,959
different alpha in the diagonal of the covariance and that's how you get this

102
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:46,999
covariance and that's how you get this relevance determination methods you can

103
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:50,209
relevance determination methods you can figure out which of the WS are needed to

104
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,699
figure out which of the WS are needed to to do the proper digression but right

105
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,209
to do the proper digression but right now this is what we have okay

106
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:58,009
now this is what we have okay we've seen the traditional unethical

107
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:00,199
we've seen the traditional unethical solution this problem you don't suppose

108
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,820
solution this problem you don't suppose to know if you know nothing about the

109
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,670
to know if you know nothing about the regression we will try to do this from

110
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,799
regression we will try to do this from scratch in the context of variational

111
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:09,350
scratch in the context of variational inference so to the variational

112
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,730
inference so to the variational inference we need to join like liquid

113
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,030
inference we need to join like liquid and here is my equations W an alpha

114
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,030
and here is my equations W an alpha parameters so the drawing likelihood

115
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,850
parameters so the drawing likelihood this written P given lovely you write it

116
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,410
this written P given lovely you write it doesn't depend anything but W there is a

117
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,090
doesn't depend anything but W there is a bit of there but I'm taking bigger to be

118
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,790
bit of there but I'm taking bigger to be constant you have that we give an

119
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,090
constant you have that we give an alternate view Papa okay and basically

120
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,550
alternate view Papa okay and basically this is sort of since we talked about

121
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,100
this is sort of since we talked about published the graphical models basically

122
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,100
published the graphical models basically would have found a picture like this

123
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,900
would have found a picture like this this defines no big questions we have

124
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,150
this defines no big questions we have seen up to now okay so we're going

125
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:56,220
seen up to now okay so we're going Preston we want to do all the parameters

126
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,230
Preston we want to do all the parameters here of W and alpha so we won't

127
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,760
here of W and alpha so we won't approximate the posterior of W naught

128
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,820
approximate the posterior of W naught forgiven t and since we're star

129
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,910
forgiven t and since we're star inference really brooks range like that

130
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,720
inference really brooks range like that okay in this claim that this is right

131
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,790
okay in this claim that this is right no it's not right it's an approximation

132
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,060
no it's not right it's an approximation that's what variation of variational

133
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,190
that's what variation of variational approximations are about they are

134
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,800
approximations are about they are approximate methods all right so we

135
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,620
approximate methods all right so we factorize this posterior to look like

136
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,820
factorize this posterior to look like this I asked you last time I'm not gonna

137
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,930
this I asked you last time I'm not gonna ask you this time you're going to get

138
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:34,350
ask you this time you're going to get there another headache so the each of

139
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,830
there another headache so the each of these distributions in the in the in the

140
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,469
these distributions in the in the in the in the factorization so for example the

141
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,650
in the factorization so for example the log of T of alpha is basically the

142
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,270
log of T of alpha is basically the expectation of the joining of black

143
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,650
expectation of the joining of black liquid with respect to all the other

144
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,620
liquid with respect to all the other parameters in this case since I'm

145
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,020
parameters in this case since I'm calculating Q foie gras the other

146
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,740
calculating Q foie gras the other parameters is W okay so if you need to

147
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,380
parameters is W okay so if you need to do in the algebra you need to expand the

148
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,870
do in the algebra you need to expand the joint log likelihood tell me the terms

149
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,260
joint log likelihood tell me the terms that depend on alpha and inverse terms

150
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,260
that depend on alpha and inverse terms anything that has W you have to take an

151
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,800
anything that has W you have to take an expectation with respect to W so if you

152
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,430
expectation with respect to W so if you plug in P alpha gamma distribution

153
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,730
plug in P alpha gamma distribution that's the log

154
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,940
that's the log this is a Gaussian easy to calculate so

155
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,910
this is a Gaussian easy to calculate so you need expectation of W transpose W

156
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,400
you need expectation of W transpose W and then she makes professional public

157
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,620
and then she makes professional public here right if you take in Gaussian and

158
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,450
here right if you take in Gaussian and you take the logs you supposed to get an

159
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,210
you take the logs you supposed to get an expectation of Bobby also why it's not

160
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,350
expectation of Bobby also why it's not there I mean just visually realize I

161
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,620
there I mean just visually realize I don't see an expectation of W there

162
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:52,160
don't see an expectation of W there right waist up because yes

163
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,170


164
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:58,930
why don't in expectation of W

165
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:58,940


166
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,549
thank you all right I mean something right in my

167
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:07,129
all right I mean something right in my eyes looks wrong I have to think myself

168
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:09,259
eyes looks wrong I have to think myself so it's good that your things up too and

169
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:12,229
so it's good that your things up too and you say oh he's paid all right but it's

170
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:15,650
you say oh he's paid all right but it's obviously not a mistake okay so when

171
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,229
obviously not a mistake okay so when remember the constant terms are things

172
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:21,679
remember the constant terms are things to depend for example maybe just me here

173
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:24,799
to depend for example maybe just me here and there constant times really and we

174
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,239
and there constant times really and we don't care because this is distribution

175
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:28,549
don't care because this is distribution on alpha the only way she will keep this

176
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:30,710
on alpha the only way she will keep this is because you want to place alpha so

177
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,329
is because you want to place alpha so you can email you see you can combine

178
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:34,309
you can email you see you can combine this log double dot there you can

179
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:36,079
this log double dot there you can combine this constant however this term

180
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,539
combine this constant however this term times alpha and basically what you get

181
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:40,159
times alpha and basically what you get is the log of it when you gamma

182
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,619
is the log of it when you gamma distribution with updated parameters so

183
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:44,599
distribution with updated parameters so the posterior looks like this and

184
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:48,349
the posterior looks like this and effectively you can see that one of the

185
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:51,849
effectively you can see that one of the reasons someone is using a gamma

186
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:56,989
reasons someone is using a gamma distribution for alpha is really because

187
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,969
distribution for alpha is really because I mean the approximate variation of

188
00:10:58,969 --> 00:11:01,549
I mean the approximate variation of distribution cos alpha is the conjugate

189
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:04,099
distribution cos alpha is the conjugate it comes basically to be an advantage of

190
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:05,960
it comes basically to be an advantage of the coefficients of the pyro we help out

191
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,449
the coefficients of the pyro we help out right before we only have this odd

192
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:10,639
right before we only have this odd positive be 0 now you added this nice

193
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,429
positive be 0 now you added this nice thing so it's pretty nuts ok even gets

194
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:20,179
thing so it's pretty nuts ok even gets an approximation get Sparkle join

195
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,619
an approximation get Sparkle join log-likelihood he the antibodies

196
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:26,509
log-likelihood he the antibodies basically straight forward but I eroded

197
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:28,460
basically straight forward but I eroded fear rather not having these summations

198
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,819
fear rather not having these summations I wrote this in a matrix vector forms

199
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:33,139
I wrote this in a matrix vector forms introducing the design matrix P that

200
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:37,659
introducing the design matrix P that involves the basis functions calculated

201
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:40,939
involves the basis functions calculated at each of the given data points right

202
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:45,679
at each of the given data points right of the design matrix and just the values

203
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,809
of the design matrix and just the values of the function that we have given of

204
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:50,449
of the function that we have given of the given input points so this is a

205
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:52,429
the given input points so this is a Gaussian can see square you can see

206
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:54,949
Gaussian can see square you can see linear term in W so if you complete the

207
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:58,759
linear term in W so if you complete the square again you get a Gaussian

208
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,739
square again you get a Gaussian similar to the prior we started but with

209
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:04,039
similar to the prior we started but with updated parameters and I emphasize since

210
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:08,179
updated parameters and I emphasize since maybe you haven't seen this even in the

211
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:09,910
maybe you haven't seen this even in the context of

212
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,619
context of simple Bayesian analysis or even

213
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:15,730
simple Bayesian analysis or even expected and you shall depend on me well

214
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,259
expected and you shall depend on me well you know calculation will give you an

215
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:19,910
you know calculation will give you an alcove it up here we did the expectation

216
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,179
alcove it up here we did the expectation of profit okay

217
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:25,550
of profit okay there is no expectation of beta because

218
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,350
there is no expectation of beta because here I'm taking bigger as I mentioned to

219
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:33,710
here I'm taking bigger as I mentioned to become stock but I saw something that

220
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,619
become stock but I saw something that precise if you look for example in in

221
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:39,470
precise if you look for example in in the variation of expression for W you

222
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,869
the variation of expression for W you notice here to be able to compute this

223
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:43,639
notice here to be able to compute this you need to know the expectation of

224
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,920
you need to know the expectation of alpha and to know the expectation of

225
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,170
alpha and to know the expectation of alpha right

226
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,540
alpha right if you need to know the expectation of

227
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,970
if you need to know the expectation of lambda transpose gamma so this is an

228
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,220
lambda transpose gamma so this is an iterative process and actually in some

229
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,449
iterative process and actually in some books they because this sort of mimics

230
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:02,749
books they because this sort of mimics the expectation maximization process

231
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,970
the expectation maximization process right you say do this update that and

232
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,150
right you say do this update that and plug in it so in lots of books you will

233
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,579
plug in it so in lots of books you will see the presentation on this as here is

234
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:13,220
see the presentation on this as here is the history here is the m-step but it's

235
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,009
the history here is the m-step but it's really slightly different okay

236
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:18,499
really slightly different okay but I know this lots of machine learning

237
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:22,549
but I know this lots of machine learning books they give this algorithms as if

238
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:31,129
books they give this algorithms as if there were you can mister very important

239
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:35,990
there were you can mister very important step various approximations so the exact

240
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,049
step various approximations so the exact posterior so if you want I'm sorry this

241
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:41,150
posterior so if you want I'm sorry this the traditional distribution right the

242
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,949
the traditional distribution right the prediction posterior distribution so

243
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:45,379
prediction posterior distribution so once you train the system you say now at

244
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:47,900
once you train the system you say now at the given X I want to know what the

245
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,929
the given X I want to know what the response is I'm taking the response yet

246
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,389
response is I'm taking the response yet to be scanner and this bounty is the

247
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:56,090
to be scanner and this bounty is the data right so that's the prolific

248
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,100
data right so that's the prolific posterior so that's basically the

249
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,169
posterior so that's basically the likelihood

250
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:02,090
likelihood why would you get if you if you know W

251
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,829
why would you get if you if you know W times the posterior what all the

252
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:06,139
times the posterior what all the parameters are integrated out and the

253
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:08,389
parameters are integrated out and the King radium here is we are not going to

254
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,360
King radium here is we are not going to plug in the actual posterior

255
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,390
plug in the actual posterior you actually plug in the variational

256
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:20,110
you actually plug in the variational approximation which is your poppy okay

257
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,120


258
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:28,250
now is the exact pastino is is very easygoing Gaussian so we could about

259
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,230
easygoing Gaussian so we could about this but here we demonstrate this is an

260
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,970
this but here we demonstrate this is an example so you plug in qw and this is

261
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,980
example so you plug in qw and this is the marginalization you remember you

262
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,480
the marginalization you remember you have something best the auction has a

263
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,070
have something best the auction has a mean that's a linear function of gamma

264
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,870
mean that's a linear function of gamma nu you know and then you have x should

265
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,600
nu you know and then you have x should not be an integration of that view right

266
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,670
not be an integration of that view right so this is really a marginal

267
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,480
so this is really a marginal distribution on P and if you look at the

268
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,990
distribution on P and if you look at the progress convenient origin systems I

269
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,329
progress convenient origin systems I told you to have them perfect in your

270
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:00,740
told you to have them perfect in your desk all right

271
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,260
desk all right look at them every day because these

272
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,150
look at them every day because these equations you use them every day ten

273
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,890
equations you use them every day ten times so you don't have to search okay

274
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,680
times so you don't have to search okay so you look at them if you plug them in

275
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,920
so you look at them if you plug them in and basically you get another Gaussian

276
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,960
and basically you get another Gaussian and you can see the the variance so of

277
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,900
and you can see the the variance so of course dependent on X so it varies with

278
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,820
course dependent on X so it varies with X and if you put again things okay

279
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,370
X and if you put again things okay you will notice again that this matrix

280
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,390
you will notice again that this matrix is n depends on you know the expectation

281
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:40,280
is n depends on you know the expectation of alpha and the design matrix P okay so

282
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,900
of alpha and the design matrix P okay so obviously the expectation of power power

283
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,100
obviously the expectation of power power we know it assuming we have computed the

284
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,620
we know it assuming we have computed the the variational approximation for of the

285
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:55,040
the variational approximation for of the posterior Palko okay the thing that I'm

286
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,420
posterior Palko okay the thing that I'm going to remind you very quickly is

287
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,510
going to remind you very quickly is every time the devil external influence

288
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,500
every time the devil external influence is a fluctuation

289
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,780
is a fluctuation you always have to verify that the

290
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,120
you always have to verify that the calculations are correct and the only

291
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,920
calculations are correct and the only way you can do this is by calculating

292
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,870
way you can do this is by calculating the lower bound and showing that the

293
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,500
the lower bound and showing that the lower bound in crease is basically

294
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,300
lower bound in crease is basically monotonically if decomposition does

295
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,650
monotonically if decomposition does increase monotonically

296
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,950
increase monotonically there is a problem okay

297
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,650
there is a problem okay so I remind you the long vault is the

298
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,050
so I remind you the long vault is the expectation with respect to the

299
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,570
expectation with respect to the variation of distribution chill of the

300
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,360
variation of distribution chill of the name of the joint likelihood divided by

301
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,610
name of the joint likelihood divided by the valuation of this depletion so it's

302
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,710
the valuation of this depletion so it's written like that if you expand one of

303
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,980
written like that if you expand one of the parents you know everything so it's

304
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,860
the parents you know everything so it's more it's a block right you just put new

305
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,060
more it's a block right you just put new things but you know what if I asked you

306
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,800
things but you know what if I asked you to push again and give me this in half

307
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,470
to push again and give me this in half an hour I bet most probably none of you

308
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,000
an hour I bet most probably none of you will complete it okay your baby with me

309
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,220
will complete it okay your baby with me all right absolutely okay

310
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,020
all right absolutely okay and the reason one of you will complete

311
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,610
and the reason one of you will complete it because you can see take you out so

312
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,579
it because you can see take you out so you do the algebra in a very so you look

313
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,130
you do the algebra in a very so you look at them you say here easy no it's not

314
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,020
at them you say here easy no it's not easy because if you try to do it on your

315
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,090
easy because if you try to do it on your own for another problem you will mess it

316
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,630
own for another problem you will mess it up okay so there is an educational

317
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,790
up okay so there is an educational purpose of doing this for simple

318
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,429
purpose of doing this for simple problems like a regression problem

319
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:21,140
problems like a regression problem because you know if you do all the songs

320
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,480
because you know if you do all the songs about the plug-in and plug in and plug

321
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,840
about the plug-in and plug in and plug in and then connect by the miracle of

322
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,420
in and then connect by the miracle of nets to what is the final answer do I

323
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:36,540
nets to what is the final answer do I have a final answer somewhere

324
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:36,550


325
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:43,340
defy belief the subscribe with Alec you because the final answer comes to be

326
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:51,390
because the final answer comes to be pretty nice somebody ate my slide okay

327
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:57,750
pretty nice somebody ate my slide okay so anyways here right but when you you

328
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,600
so anyways here right but when you you did a very nice answer okay

329
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:10,790
did a very nice answer okay end of story okay and this is this

330
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,880
end of story okay and this is this rebound in connection so for example if

331
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,560
rebound in connection so for example if you're doing integration and you have a

332
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,170
you're doing integration and you have a bunch of data and you say you know let's

333
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,910
bunch of data and you say you know let's say you use polynomials in this case you

334
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,590
say you use polynomials in this case you say what's the other of polynomials that

335
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,480
say what's the other of polynomials that I need to use you better represent the

336
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,250
I need to use you better represent the data you know I'd be much more

337
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,730
data you know I'd be much more likelihood Maxwell's argument saying

338
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:34,740


339
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:43,380
because the will keep increasing but you will never fade okay so with variation

340
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,180
will never fade okay so with variation influenced and using these lower bounds

341
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,970
influenced and using these lower bounds of the case and you can see here it says

342
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,350
of the case and you can see here it says M equal trees what explains the data

343
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:57,420
M equal trees what explains the data okay and I think we already discussed

344
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,700
okay and I think we already discussed and I may come back today also if you do

345
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,380
and I may come back today also if you do notice election right and you put let's

346
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,200
notice election right and you put let's say some vehicle prior over the space of

347
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,770
say some vehicle prior over the space of the number of polynomials in essence

348
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:15,150
the number of polynomials in essence this this is you know very you know this

349
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,020
this this is you know very you know this population effectively gives you an

350
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,180
population effectively gives you an approximation to the posterior of the

351
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,390
approximation to the posterior of the model right so basically this is nothing

352
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,040
model right so basically this is nothing else but the posterior of the model with

353
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,470
else but the posterior of the model with when you know L 7 equal to three okay so

354
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,530
when you know L 7 equal to three okay so this is a very nice way to do model

355
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,710
this is a very nice way to do model selection

356
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,680
selection right and this is a very nice picture

357
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,830
right and this is a very nice picture from sorry I mean no picture were just

358
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:50,030
from sorry I mean no picture were just really a little awkward around this

359
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,860
really a little awkward around this calculations run the matter of using the

360
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:59,090
calculations run the matter of using the Kevin leftists t-bolts so basically on

361
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,090
Kevin leftists t-bolts so basically on the customer choice you the map of

362
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,890
the customer choice you the map of inaction so a calculation of the

363
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,250
inaction so a calculation of the posterior of these models of the

364
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,650
posterior of these models of the universe of polynomials given some data

365
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,830
universe of polynomials given some data which here we have five data points and

366
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,130
which here we have five data points and you can see that very few data the metro

367
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,870
you can see that very few data the metro bicycle devaluation reference that's you

368
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,210
bicycle devaluation reference that's you you know what use the lower of the

369
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,350
you know what use the lower of the polynomial okay the lowest model is what

370
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,690
polynomial okay the lowest model is what you need but when you increase the

371
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,940
you need but when you increase the number of data for example here it

372
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,460
number of data for example here it immediately puts the posterior on m

373
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,890
immediately puts the posterior on m equal to three very low and it tells you

374
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,810
equal to three very low and it tells you not select the model with M equal to two

375
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:42,320
not select the model with M equal to two this method is empirical Baggett's

376
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,540
this method is empirical Baggett's method basically okay and this is what

377
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,960
method basically okay and this is what you know products we put the question in

378
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,170
you know products we put the question in the tall they are reading machine

379
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,520
the tall they are reading machine learning looks this is basically the

380
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,070
learning looks this is basically the evidence approximation it doesn't do as

381
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,520
evidence approximation it doesn't do as well

382
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,980
well so you can see for example in the

383
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,740
so you can see for example in the evidence of observation here it puts a

384
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,560
evidence of observation here it puts a lot on this posterior for m equal to R

385
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,250
lot on this posterior for m equal to R but here basically tell mostly currently

386
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,740
but here basically tell mostly currently distributed we have a few data because

387
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,290
distributed we have a few data because in that case is the prior that dominate

388
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,850
in that case is the prior that dominate the

389
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:22,490
this posterior here there's no really such a thing so this is not cool evasion

390
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,640
such a thing so this is not cool evasion but this cool evasion

391
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:25,650
but this cool evasion

392
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:32,970
all right I am going to do this but I mentioned that you can expand this type

393
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,320
mentioned that you can expand this type of calculations when you take this

394
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,210
of calculations when you take this precision in the likelihood model also

395
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,340
precision in the likelihood model also to be around the body moon right so you

396
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:47,130
to be around the body moon right so you can put a plier on that and in you know

397
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,750
can put a plier on that and in you know you can basically repeat all the

398
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,930
you can basically repeat all the calculations and you can calculate so if

399
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,330
calculations and you can calculate so if you put a gamma prior on beta you can

400
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,490
you put a gamma prior on beta you can calculate an approximate posterior but

401
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,070
calculate an approximate posterior but this launched a gamma and you can see

402
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,810
this launched a gamma and you can see the formulas come very nicely in the

403
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:04,500
the formulas come very nicely in the very close call you know and and the

404
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,170
very close call you know and and the answer is really nothing significant and

405
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,630
answer is really nothing significant and you can actually calculate the

406
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,880
you can actually calculate the predictive distribution and it's not

407
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,470
predictive distribution and it's not surprising actually for example you look

408
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,720
surprising actually for example you look at the variance comes to be identical

409
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,610
at the variance comes to be identical with the previous result but this kind

410
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,550
with the previous result but this kind of leader you have expectation of beta

411
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,550
of leader you have expectation of beta okay so so much of the answers really

412
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:29,850
okay so so much of the answers really sort of are expected okay all right okay

413
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,530
sort of are expected okay all right okay so I'm going to switch now lecture and

414
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,300
so I'm going to switch now lecture and I'm going to come back remind me to

415
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:43,620
I'm going to come back remind me to write 16 after we we move from this

416
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:43,630


417
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:50,669
and very fundamental problem okay so we're going to discuss something that

418
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:54,270
we're going to discuss something that looks a trivial to lots of you but you

419
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,299
looks a trivial to lots of you but you will if you search the literature you

420
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:58,950
will if you search the literature you find a lots of Papers written because

421
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,409
find a lots of Papers written because it's an extremely fundamental problem

422
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:05,279
it's an extremely fundamental problem that comes everywhere so the idea here

423
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,549
that comes everywhere so the idea here is we are talking about a mixture of

424
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:11,690
is we are talking about a mixture of gaussians and what interest to do

425
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,039
gaussians and what interest to do approximate Bayesian inference for a

426
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,930
approximate Bayesian inference for a mixture of gaussians so what does that

427
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,240
mixture of gaussians so what does that mean you know you know become from a

428
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,890
mean you know you know become from a mixture of the two three four five

429
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,169
mixture of the two three four five gaussians I'm doing have to you I don't

430
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:27,570
gaussians I'm doing have to you I don't tell you generate the data and I'm

431
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,370
tell you generate the data and I'm telling you go and calculate the

432
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,320
telling you go and calculate the posterior of the mixing components and

433
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,510
posterior of the mixing components and for its component compute the mean and

434
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:44,310
for its component compute the mean and the variance okay simple ways to do and

435
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:47,820
the variance okay simple ways to do and so I'm going to pretend that you have

436
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,190
so I'm going to pretend that you have never seen this problem before in other

437
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,320
never seen this problem before in other ways you don't know other solutions okay

438
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,450
ways you don't know other solutions okay so we're gonna concentrate on variation

439
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:59,270
so we're gonna concentrate on variation of the interest object okay and again

440
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,710
of the interest object okay and again this is very fundamental in machine

441
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,149
this is very fundamental in machine learning it comes everywhere and

442
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:08,970
learning it comes everywhere and actually this concept of gaussians you

443
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,159
actually this concept of gaussians you can even put another world that make it

444
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:14,130
can even put another world that make it mixed up thousand processes okay we will

445
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,720
mixed up thousand processes okay we will not discuss that in this course and

446
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,850
not discuss that in this course and actually to make it even more relevant

447
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,370
actually to make it even more relevant to research the sort of mixture you can

448
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,200
to research the sort of mixture you can say infinite mixture of Gaussian

449
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,539
say infinite mixture of Gaussian processes so basically you can do sort

450
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,899
processes so basically you can do sort of relevance determination and trial

451
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:30,390
of relevance determination and trial infinite knowledge component and let

452
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,580
infinite knowledge component and let this analysis figure out which ones are

453
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,220
this analysis figure out which ones are named it okay and it doesn't have to be

454
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,680
named it okay and it doesn't have to be gaussians can be Gaussian processes and

455
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,020
gaussians can be Gaussian processes and this needs to be a very recent sort of

456
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,210
this needs to be a very recent sort of relevant results basically that some of

457
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,840
relevant results basically that some of you

458
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,930
you or someone feel their interest to

459
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:58,779
or someone feel their interest to research okay so we actually discuss the

460
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:01,620
research okay so we actually discuss the problem no need to read anything so

461
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,330
problem no need to read anything so remember that we have observations of

462
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:08,049
remember that we have observations of some de vita XM it's data just relate

463
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,749
some de vita XM it's data just relate and valuable of 2080 with it that I call

464
00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:12,999
and valuable of 2080 with it that I call its GM so you can think of Zn being a

465
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:15,310
its GM so you can think of Zn being a label body blighters here it is this

466
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,169
label body blighters here it is this component of it is Gaussian or web

467
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:19,450
component of it is Gaussian or web browser above Gaussian so that's the

468
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:25,690
browser above Gaussian so that's the late environment it's the you know it's

469
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,649
late environment it's the you know it's extra information of two gaussians it's

470
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:31,240
extra information of two gaussians it's version will have its own mean and

471
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,299
version will have its own mean and variance all right and this local

472
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,180
variance all right and this local variables will be defined through some

473
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,009
variables will be defined through some polite other than the parameters of the

474
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:42,220
polite other than the parameters of the drive or the cold clear pie and I will

475
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,149
drive or the cold clear pie and I will give you the specifics on the slides to

476
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:49,509
give you the specifics on the slides to come so their joint likelihood so this

477
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:51,249
come so their joint likelihood so this is the observation this the latent

478
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:52,810
is the observation this the latent variables these are the various

479
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,700
variables these are the various parameters to define the priors

480
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,190
parameters to define the priors so basically you can save this

481
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,259
so basically you can save this capitalization also graphically the

482
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:04,419
capitalization also graphically the rezoning of likelihood would be the

483
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:07,450
rezoning of likelihood would be the probability of x given C and lanthanum

484
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,210
probability of x given C and lanthanum the probability of Z given by the

485
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,220
the probability of Z given by the probability of new given lambda and the

486
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,039
probability of new given lambda and the probability of love so this is sort of a

487
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,999
probability of love so this is sort of a very heavy very simple graph but the

488
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:23,080
very heavy very simple graph but the calculation you will see it's not it's

489
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,950
calculation you will see it's not it's painful

490
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,860
painful okay but it is a calculation that again

491
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,070
okay but it is a calculation that again if you do it once you will get the sense

492
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,799
if you do it once you will get the sense of what it is and how it works

493
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,019
of what it is and how it works okay so in my view for example in the

494
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:41,490
okay so in my view for example in the midst of noxious right if you put this

495
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,639
midst of noxious right if you put this joint

496
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:44,740
joint replica together this comes to be

497
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,490
replica together this comes to be Gaussian and if a condition actions a

498
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:54,870
Gaussian and if a condition actions a young get a gout okay

499
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:54,880


500
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,650
the condition excellency if I integrate thumbs D okay you're not gonna go right

501
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,390
thumbs D okay you're not gonna go right but the joint likelihood is a Gaussian

502
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:11,160
but the joint likelihood is a Gaussian and that's why we operate okay so I want

503
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,630
and that's why we operate okay so I want you to look at this distribution that

504
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,830
you to look at this distribution that tells me what you understand it so px

505
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:24,930
tells me what you understand it so px given Z looks like that then you tell me

506
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:30,810
given Z looks like that then you tell me everything is not okay

507
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:30,820


508
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,490
I mean I'm going to need to compute write this every term so P of x given Z

509
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,350
write this every term so P of x given Z and V other parameters is given like

510
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,780
and V other parameters is given like that so I have n data points I have a

511
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,820
that so I have n data points I have a mixed with K components so does this

512
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:51,090
mixed with K components so does this make sense so C and K takes what - what

513
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:57,890
make sense so C and K takes what - what is the one of the values in K takes Z so

514
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,080
is the one of the values in K takes Z so so for every data point right only

515
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,210
so for every data point right only assume this time see that product is

516
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,080
assume this time see that product is going to be a Gaussian and that would be

517
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,550
going to be a Gaussian and that would be only for the K equals e and k equal to 1

518
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:17,190
only for the K equals e and k equal to 1 right

519
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,200


520
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,420
we have seen this about the thousand times of denominated so close to a very

521
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,540
times of denominated so close to a very compact way of writing things everyone

522
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:33,330
compact way of writing things everyone is in okay you know the most we listen

523
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,770
is in okay you know the most we listen this tapes from home because they have

524
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,450
this tapes from home because they have nothing else to do right is true love

525
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,030
nothing else to do right is true love maybe scream once or say something

526
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,010
maybe scream once or say something so they think that I'm not talking to a

527
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:46,500
so they think that I'm not talking to a wall alright because you know lots of

528
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,320
wall alright because you know lots of professors like talking to themselves

529
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,950
professors like talking to themselves alright so okay I can even pass you the

530
00:28:52,950 --> 00:29:07,770
alright so okay I can even pass you the microphone so weird so Z and remember so

531
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,960
microphone so weird so Z and remember so you know we are thinking about the next

532
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,360
you know we are thinking about the next another somebody find this mixing

533
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,100
another somebody find this mixing quotation spy and I want you to look at

534
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:21,840
quotation spy and I want you to look at this and to me it's okay that I'm either

535
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,270
this and to me it's okay that I'm either way we have it here remember every point

536
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:31,860
way we have it here remember every point xn3 Seussian so so what is this here the

537
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,730
xn3 Seussian so so what is this here the player that I am using is so over all

538
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,460
player that I am using is so over all the data points I would write what is

539
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,220
the data points I would write what is this what is this conditional

540
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:47,760
this what is this conditional distribution of Z given PI so it would

541
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,550
distribution of Z given PI so it would say at the given point and only one of

542
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,310
say at the given point and only one of those things one of the one of the case

543
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,560
those things one of the one of the case this would be equal to one and this will

544
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:03,160
this would be equal to one and this will give you okay all right

545
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,170


546
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:12,570
all right hi and that player is going to be adding a clip live okay

547
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,520
be adding a clip live okay and and that's what I mentioned that

548
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,180
and and that's what I mentioned that this a disc and easily extended to

549
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:24,040
this a disc and easily extended to infinite mixture of of gaussians by

550
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,380
infinite mixture of of gaussians by substituting here by using a declare

551
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,930
substituting here by using a declare process basically to do a special user

552
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,120
process basically to do a special user declare prior service list the

553
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,860
declare prior service list the parameters on cozinha wants to remember

554
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:36,940
parameters on cozinha wants to remember of the notation okay and you may say why

555
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,650
of the notation okay and you may say why did the clip prior because based is

556
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,310
did the clip prior because based is going to make all the posteriors to be

557
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,980
going to make all the posteriors to be nothing else but updates basically the

558
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,570
nothing else but updates basically the parameters of the distributions that you

559
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,500
parameters of the distributions that you see right now so basically these are

560
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,240
see right now so basically these are conjugate priors okay so they are going

561
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,500
conjugate priors okay so they are going to make the algebra easy okay the

562
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,920
to make the algebra easy okay the parameters mean atlanta and you may have

563
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,780
parameters mean atlanta and you may have seen this for evaluation you may not

564
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,440
seen this for evaluation you may not have seen it so basically we write this

565
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,260
have seen it so basically we write this as a product over all the components of

566
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,400
as a product over all the components of a deficient all right with the lots of

567
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,710
a deficient all right with the lots of unknown parameters but you know here the

568
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:24,850
unknown parameters but you know here the precision depends the precision this

569
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,370
precision depends the precision this condition of the precision and then the

570
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,530
condition of the precision and then the precision we put a reserve distribution

571
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,600
precision we put a reserve distribution this is you know in one dimension you

572
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,270
this is you know in one dimension you know how this will look like this will

573
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,160
know how this will look like this will be devoid of Gaussian and what will not

574
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,620
be devoid of Gaussian and what will not be for the precision would did we say

575
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:44,730
be for the precision would did we say who uses a prior

576
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:44,740


577
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,970
what should I become below the regression problem what was the point of

578
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:54,340
regression problem what was the point of the precision he was a memo said the

579
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,049
the precision he was a memo said the wizard mr. mission based as a

580
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:58,990
wizard mr. mission based as a generalization to multivariate variables

581
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,680
generalization to multivariate variables of the gamma distribution right I mean

582
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,240
of the gamma distribution right I mean if you think you know the wizard

583
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,039
if you think you know the wizard distribution is sort of a distribution

584
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:09,220
distribution is sort of a distribution although symmetric positive-definite

585
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:14,440
although symmetric positive-definite matrices okay very nice distribution I

586
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,960
matrices okay very nice distribution I me if you think distribution of a matrix

587
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,629
me if you think distribution of a matrix is less and what about symmetric

588
00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:21,460
is less and what about symmetric positive matrices here is the Parthians

589
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:26,710
positive matrices here is the Parthians lambda k okay so this is again all right

590
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,440
lambda k okay so this is again all right so when you have that mean and precision

591
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,049
so when you have that mean and precision unknown okay you write like that if

592
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:33,850
unknown okay you write like that if actually he did not use the precision

593
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,039
actually he did not use the precision but use the variance this can you can

594
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,840
but use the variance this can you can write the same thing but instead of a

595
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,360
write the same thing but instead of a wizard distribution you put an English

596
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,680
wizard distribution you put an English wizard distribution

597
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,450
wizard distribution okay so what you use you can manipulate

598
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,570
okay so what you use you can manipulate you one way or another but using here

599
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:53,129
you one way or another but using here precision makes the algebra way is you

600
00:32:53,129 --> 00:32:57,669
precision makes the algebra way is you so there is a lecture for notes to start

601
00:32:57,669 --> 00:33:00,870
so there is a lecture for notes to start with lots of private parameters right so

602
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,970
with lots of private parameters right so you can plug in some reasonable value so

603
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,200
you can plug in some reasonable value so I indicate some of us here so so we need

604
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,419
I indicate some of us here so so we need to perhaps make now the posterior of

605
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:14,980
to perhaps make now the posterior of this massive unknowns and those are

606
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,509
this massive unknowns and those are those are the positives of the latent

607
00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:18,669
those are the positives of the latent variable z the pristine of the next

608
00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:21,250
variable z the pristine of the next coefficient spy the prestige of the

609
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,399
coefficient spy the prestige of the means mu and remember amy is a vector

610
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,100
means mu and remember amy is a vector but the components are having less of

611
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,379
but the components are having less of those all right and the pursue of this

612
00:33:29,379 --> 00:33:31,269
those all right and the pursue of this variance is long time and i have a lot

613
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:34,360
variance is long time and i have a lot of okay so this is sort of a written in

614
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,009
of okay so this is sort of a written in a compact way and the only sort of time

615
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:42,070
a compact way and the only sort of time i when i'm gonna baste i'm normally this

616
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,649
i when i'm gonna baste i'm normally this is cubes if you apply give them you

617
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:48,899
is cubes if you apply give them you planta because if we I mean as a minimum

618
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:52,649
planta because if we I mean as a minimum to expect to get the conjugate you know

619
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:54,779
to expect to get the conjugate you know if you expect a bit of a stated that has

620
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:56,639
if you expect a bit of a stated that has the phone of the prior oats obviously

621
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:58,469
the phone of the prior oats obviously you're going to get let's say looking at

622
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,700
you're going to get let's say looking at you know long time you're going to get

623
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,369
you know long time you're going to get some factorization of you given long

624
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:05,279
some factorization of you given long papyrus evaluations division of real

625
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,409
papyrus evaluations division of real time so you want to keep them like that

626
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:09,659
time so you want to keep them like that together otherwise you're not going to

627
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,849
together otherwise you're not going to take advantage of these conjugate priors

628
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:15,000
take advantage of these conjugate priors that you use okay so this will it be

629
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,659
that you use okay so this will it be different from the cauterization this is

630
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,809
different from the cauterization this is going to pop your eyes and interesting

631
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:33,329
going to pop your eyes and interesting to see so basically you can think right

632
00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:37,079
to see so basically you can think right but we optimized it in one of the

633
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,470
but we optimized it in one of the factors we have a group of variables and

634
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,549
factors we have a group of variables and there's a potential reaction in

635
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:43,260
there's a potential reaction in variation levels will you do this for a

636
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,639
variation levels will you do this for a purpose okay

637
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,099
purpose okay you are going to update the group of

638
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:51,589
you are going to update the group of values together

639
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:51,599


640
00:34:51,599 --> 00:35:04,410
okay so and try to keep taking assuming if you give a sign what you understand

641
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:07,019
if you give a sign what you understand nothing and in that case I will click

642
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:10,980
nothing and in that case I will click twice so the number K of Z alright as

643
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,539
twice so the number K of Z alright as the optimal distribution is the

644
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:15,000
the optimal distribution is the expectation with respect to all the

645
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,779
expectation with respect to all the other variables

646
00:35:15,779 --> 00:35:18,990
other variables Jaime Lanka of the log of the joint of

647
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:22,019
Jaime Lanka of the log of the joint of likelihood right okay so when one of

648
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:25,170
likelihood right okay so when one of these we're going to expand this all

649
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,970
these we're going to expand this all right and keep on in the terms the

650
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:29,160
right and keep on in the terms the dependency all right let's see what type

651
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,859
dependency all right let's see what type of distribution it comes out so the only

652
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,870
of distribution it comes out so the only times that depend on Z is from this

653
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,430
times that depend on Z is from this condition of Z given the mixing

654
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:40,049
condition of Z given the mixing coefficients and this likely Patel okay

655
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:41,849
coefficients and this likely Patel okay this depends on a and PI so these

656
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:44,370
this depends on a and PI so these expectations with respected by which

657
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:48,180
expectations with respected by which depends on in Atlanta so the expectation

658
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,109
depends on in Atlanta so the expectation is with respect in the Atlanta possible

659
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,260
is with respect in the Atlanta possible never share okay

660
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:58,490
never share okay and the reason I used to insist that you

661
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,890
and the reason I used to insist that you guys type this things in your homework

662
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,940
guys type this things in your homework when your time the answers obvious if

663
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,750
when your time the answers obvious if you do this by chance you you never gave

664
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,200
you do this by chance you you never gave option to make this to work you have a

665
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,000
option to make this to work you have a complete mess so if you take P of Z

666
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,030
complete mess so if you take P of Z given pile given like this you take the

667
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,590
given pile given like this you take the likelihood you know like all this have

668
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,680
likelihood you know like all this have the previous formulas so you remember

669
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,300
the previous formulas so you remember you will take it next year so it will be

670
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,630
you will take it next year so it will be 0 times R over PI and then will be an

671
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:31,310
0 times R over PI and then will be an expectation with respect to PI and here

672
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:34,190
expectation with respect to PI and here we're going to have Z times the end of

673
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,770
we're going to have Z times the end of this with sigasi so obviously it going

674
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,950
this with sigasi so obviously it going to give Z or throw the same thing and

675
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:44,330
to give Z or throw the same thing and that same thing is what you see here all

676
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,720
that same thing is what you see here all right this comes this thing comes from

677
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,730
right this comes this thing comes from here and all of the stones come from

678
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:55,330
here and all of the stones come from where from this guy's you can you see it

679
00:36:55,330 --> 00:37:01,640
where from this guy's you can you see it yes ok so this time wasted for

680
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,370
yes ok so this time wasted for memorization factor we don't really care

681
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:08,170
memorization factor we don't really care about the cost of the time and okay and

682
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,099
about the cost of the time and okay and and they are paying to dance because now

683
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:16,040
and they are paying to dance because now this level all depends on the

684
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,270
this level all depends on the expectation of lava fight a write what

685
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,800
expectation of lava fight a write what is the dimension where you have to be

686
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,590
is the dimension where you have to be interested so the content is that means

687
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:27,200
interested so the content is that means you have to find the fluctuation for try

688
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,020
you have to find the fluctuation for try to complete this time identifying the

689
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,480
to complete this time identifying the various of expression for tau the point

690
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,890
various of expression for tau the point is you need to know the various

691
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,109
is you need to know the various approximation from you enter the joint

692
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:40,660
approximation from you enter the joint basically ok so we're not yet there

693
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,410
basically ok so we're not yet there so this is the result ok well mr. have

694
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:50,000
so this is the result ok well mr. have depends on these other posteriors but

695
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,920
depends on these other posteriors but obviously you can immediately see that

696
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,820
obviously you can immediately see that this variation of approximation for the

697
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,730
this variation of approximation for the posterior of G it's basically written

698
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:04,470
posterior of G it's basically written all of your power Z okay remember what

699
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,090
all of your power Z okay remember what was happened in the prior shared before

700
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,920
was happened in the prior shared before when we started in circuit well what did

701
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:18,270
when we started in circuit well what did we have when we started it was by the

702
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,710
we have when we started it was by the mixing coefficients okay

703
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:24,450
mixing coefficients okay there have five

704
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:24,460


705
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:29,340
all right so if you can write this with an equal sign you get basically you know

706
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:36,270
an equal sign you get basically you know divided by the summation of this result

707
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,150
divided by the summation of this result for every data point there so

708
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,440
for every data point there so distribution looks like that which is

709
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:46,530
distribution looks like that which is identical to the to the problem that we

710
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:59,970
identical to the to the problem that we started this equations to start with

711
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,310
started this equations to start with right now we have observed the day time

712
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:07,760
right now we have observed the day time we have updated the posterior of Z so

713
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:07,770


714
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:14,130
the responsibility okay so nice to be on tells me what's the responsibility the

715
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:17,130
tells me what's the responsibility the component K takes to explain point n

716
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:22,530
component K takes to explain point n okay and when you actually are going to

717
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:34,050
okay and when you actually are going to this responsibility every point you can

718
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:38,609
this responsibility every point you can put a bit of red depending on this

719
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,070
put a bit of red depending on this posterior responsibilities then actually

720
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,359
posterior responsibilities then actually when you do this graphs they look

721
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:43,050
when you do this graphs they look wonderful

722
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,849
wonderful and in the literature that's how people

723
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,160
and in the literature that's how people demonstrate the Costera supposed to be

724
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:53,099
demonstrate the Costera supposed to be now if you're back okay but these are

725
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,140
now if you're back okay but these are the post irresponsible

726
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,950
the post irresponsible okay and we have discussed this when we

727
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,180
okay and we have discussed this when we were talking about expectation

728
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,890
were talking about expectation maximization we spent lectures and

729
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:08,830
maximization we spent lectures and lectures on this because this is

730
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:08,840


731
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:15,830
valuable basically expectation of Z and K is our NK you remember that because

732
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,690
K is our NK you remember that because you can only take values 0 and 1 right

733
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,370
you can only take values 0 and 1 right so the expectation is equal to the

734
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,380
so the expectation is equal to the probability that's the posterior

735
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,030
probability that's the posterior probability which is R and K now up to

736
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,940
probability which is R and K now up to now is right that we have a nice job for

737
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,740
now is right that we have a nice job for this but this setting for this R depends

738
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,690
this but this setting for this R depends on many expectations with respect to the

739
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,030
on many expectations with respect to the other distributions so notice we can

740
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,440
other distributions so notice we can actually complete all of this we are

741
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,290
actually complete all of this we are going off work I mean it's nice to say

742
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,600
going off work I mean it's nice to say this is what it is but how do you

743
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,100
this is what it is but how do you compute a roll and and so we will keep

744
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:58,430
compute a roll and and so we will keep going and see how about I think we have

745
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,960
going and see how about I think we have seen them when we discuss about

746
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,740
seen them when we discuss about expectation maximization so this is the

747
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:12,200
expectation maximization so this is the point in the garbage and carry all right

748
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,420
point in the garbage and carry all right so basically whatever the points when

749
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,640
so basically whatever the points when you sum this mysterious puts benefits

750
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,310
you sum this mysterious puts benefits now this is the effective sample name on

751
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,090
now this is the effective sample name on the Gaussian K all right so you take on

752
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,010
the Gaussian K all right so you take on the exist you want to apply them with

753
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,390
the exist you want to apply them with the posterior possibilities and this is

754
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:29,240
the posterior possibilities and this is the effective area okay so basically I

755
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,700
the effective area okay so basically I am defining this because if you have

756
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,680
am defining this because if you have these definitions you will see that the

757
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,230
these definitions you will see that the algebra is going to simplify and one

758
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:39,800
algebra is going to simplify and one identity that you may want to pay

759
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,960
identity that you may want to pay attention because the terms can be not

760
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,690
attention because the terms can be not just on this setting but in many related

761
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,710
just on this setting but in many related settings will have these

762
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,770
settings will have these responsibilities it is very nice

763
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,650
responsibilities it is very nice identity that comes directly basically

764
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,270
identity that comes directly basically by taking the definition of SK and

765
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,800
by taking the definition of SK and expanding it okay

766
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,800
expanding it okay so somewhere in the derivations we've

767
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,960
so somewhere in the derivations we've not said today but when we read the

768
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,880
not said today but when we read the notes

769
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,040
notes this is a calculation or concept okay so

770
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,620
this is a calculation or concept okay so we want to calculate Q up by mu and

771
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:13,500
we want to calculate Q up by mu and lambda so this would be the love of that

772
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,570
lambda so this would be the love of that advocate pioneer lanta will be the

773
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,450
advocate pioneer lanta will be the expectation with respect to Z of the log

774
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,830
expectation with respect to Z of the log of the join the likelihood with the only

775
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,180
of the join the likelihood with the only times we're going to be keeping is

776
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,640
times we're going to be keeping is anything that depends on P near Atlanta

777
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,530
anything that depends on P near Atlanta and in those times anything that

778
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:32,410
and in those times anything that contains it will take expectations so

779
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:37,240
contains it will take expectations so basically what you get is you get from

780
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,320
basically what you get is you get from the prior to get love of the prior from

781
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,840
the prior to get love of the prior from the pile remember we had a joint

782
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,200
the pile remember we had a joint distribution of in Atlanta but Gaussian

783
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,750
distribution of in Atlanta but Gaussian wizard distribution there is a 0 depends

784
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:56,380
wizard distribution there is a 0 depends on PI so we can have an expectation this

785
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,070
on PI so we can have an expectation this Z here inside the time remember we have

786
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,620
Z here inside the time remember we have the Gaussian to the powers east of the

787
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,090
the Gaussian to the powers east of the signal comes down so we have an

788
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,530
signal comes down so we have an expectation times the log of the

789
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:08,790
expectation times the log of the Gaussian plus constants okay and

790
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,410
Gaussian plus constants okay and interestingly enough right when you look

791
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:14,800
interestingly enough right when you look at this distribution okay my thing just

792
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:21,510
at this distribution okay my thing just died okay alright so when you look on on

793
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:27,130
died okay alright so when you look on on the does anybody else with you that's a

794
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,260
the does anybody else with you that's a very stupid question right it's like

795
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,650
very stupid question right it's like asking if you have any an entire forest

796
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,040
asking if you have any an entire forest walking right something like that okay

797
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,530
walking right something like that okay so you have no batteries how can you

798
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:39,820
so you have no batteries how can you leave home without batteries that's

799
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,570
leave home without batteries that's unacceptable

800
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:46,300
unacceptable okay so you can circle the equation they

801
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:55,300
okay so you can circle the equation they are right but the certainly over K right

802
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,550
are right but the certainly over K right because you can see the two summations

803
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,010
because you can see the two summations from Kelly and we have no joy when you

804
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,960
from Kelly and we have no joy when you get rid of the log basically you get the

805
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,380
get rid of the log basically you get the factorization over K so 29

806
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:10,970
factorization over K so 29 okay so so tsunamis I'm gonna put in the

807
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:16,529
okay so so tsunamis I'm gonna put in the the probably shall we have the condition

808
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:20,160
the probably shall we have the condition of Z given pi we know expectations from

809
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,039
of Z given pi we know expectations from exists of the post irresponsibility so

810
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:25,500
exists of the post irresponsibility so we planned in all of this together all

811
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,289
we planned in all of this together all right

812
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:31,470
right actually sometimes fathers have life if

813
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:44,509
actually sometimes fathers have life if you versatility the okay this the bottom

814
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:44,519


815
00:44:44,519 --> 00:45:04,099
or I need to change okay all right okay all right let me try

816
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:04,109


817
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:14,570
okay have to learn than you think yeah

818
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:14,580


819
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:22,640
all right right so this croissant okay this good

820
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:30,020
right so this croissant okay this good oh I see okay oh this is heavy lighting

821
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,980
oh I see okay oh this is heavy lighting nice this is extra powerful it comes

822
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,370
nice this is extra powerful it comes from Beijing you know when planes fly

823
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:39,740
from Beijing you know when planes fly you go up on the skies right let me use

824
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,660
you go up on the skies right let me use it outside the classroom okay

825
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:44,660
it outside the classroom okay all right it's very powerful I will

826
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:58,490
all right it's very powerful I will confiscate it right this here this is

827
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:02,839
confiscate it right this here this is what we get we need to substitute versed

828
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:04,910
what we get we need to substitute versed in there all right

829
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:09,700
in there all right actually the expectations and let's see

830
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,160
actually the expectations and let's see okay let's see what we get

831
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:22,789
okay let's see what we get okay again I don't want to give you all

832
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:24,200
okay again I don't want to give you all the algebra but there are some tricky

833
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,549
the algebra but there are some tricky things that come all the time

834
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:28,010
things that come all the time so if I notice them I need to tell you

835
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:29,809
so if I notice them I need to tell you what's going on so basically we start

836
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:34,370
what's going on so basically we start killed in this expectation of respect to

837
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:47,170
killed in this expectation of respect to zero the joint of likelihood okay and

838
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:47,180


839
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:53,660
over carry as decisions with some precision that then comes with some way

840
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,390
precision that then comes with some way start so you don't have to take the one

841
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,000
start so you don't have to take the one service and you may say well the usual

842
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,099
service and you may say well the usual distribution of a distribution or posted

843
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:03,950
distribution of a distribution or posted definite matrices well yeah you have to

844
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:06,349
definite matrices well yeah you have to do it because of this character right

845
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:08,660
do it because of this character right you have to do this so you take most

846
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:14,359
you have to do this so you take most launched etc etc and and you get

847
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:15,950
launched etc etc and and you get basically you look at the terms that

848
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:16,859
basically you look at the terms that they were warning me

849
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:19,259
they were warning me Lanta and he looked at the optimal

850
00:47:19,259 --> 00:47:21,900
Lanta and he looked at the optimal distribution so out of this you can

851
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,700
distribution so out of this you can extract phoneme in London you can see

852
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,190
extract phoneme in London you can see lower to start up in Atlanta is

853
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:34,009
lower to start up in Atlanta is basically this two lines here alright

854
00:47:34,009 --> 00:47:34,019


855
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:56,420
surprising okay alright so this is the

856
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:56,430


857
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:25,890
okay for example okay and if you with in this expression

858
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:30,210
okay and if you with in this expression you basically get a Gaussian in new all

859
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,650
you basically get a Gaussian in new all right you can see it if you place the

860
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:34,910
right you can see it if you place the square and that's the mastership

861
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:41,670
square and that's the mastership alright so from this again if you and

862
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:50,339
alright so from this again if you and now how do you defend the posterior is

863
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:54,299
now how do you defend the posterior is the conditional for several times the

864
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:56,819
the conditional for several times the variation distribution of Ishita so if

865
00:48:56,819 --> 00:49:00,029
variation distribution of Ishita so if you take an action that you can actually

866
00:49:00,029 --> 00:49:04,589
you take an action that you can actually compute the I'll keep going backwards if

867
00:49:04,589 --> 00:49:06,329
compute the I'll keep going backwards if you take the function that you can

868
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:10,950
you take the function that you can actually compute the approximation of

869
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:14,099
actually compute the approximation of the posterior of lambda and so if you do

870
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:16,470
the posterior of lambda and so if you do the algebra you get many different weird

871
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:22,210
the algebra you get many different weird terms okay and if you have patience and

872
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:25,870
terms okay and if you have patience and you actually homophobe has disappear all

873
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,970
you actually homophobe has disappear all the things cancel out and you get their

874
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,610
the things cancel out and you get their wonderful approximation for the love of

875
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,530
wonderful approximation for the love of the key of lambda k that looks like that

876
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:36,970
the key of lambda k that looks like that okay well this wk inversed comes to be

877
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:40,030
okay well this wk inversed comes to be this which you may think it's a

878
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:44,950
this which you may think it's a complicated expression okay and UK comes

879
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:47,590
complicated expression okay and UK comes to be u 0 plus 10 K and you know that I

880
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:49,780
to be u 0 plus 10 K and you know that I prefer this is the relative distribution

881
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:57,040
prefer this is the relative distribution effect so when you look at this right

882
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,650
effect so when you look at this right you can still submit additional under K

883
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:04,830
you can still submit additional under K but what type of distribution is this

884
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:12,070
but what type of distribution is this exponential you think I get so what you

885
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:14,050
exponential you think I get so what you gets a wizard distribution and here's

886
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:20,470
gets a wizard distribution and here's the answer okay alright so the combined

887
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,900
the answer okay alright so the combined basically distribution formula lanta is

888
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,950
basically distribution formula lanta is a Gaussian wizard okay so the Gaussian

889
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:29,380
a Gaussian wizard okay so the Gaussian the precision lambda comes with the

890
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,390
the precision lambda comes with the wizard next to it and kill all the

891
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:34,090
wizard next to it and kill all the parameters selectively the approximation

892
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:36,910
parameters selectively the approximation to the posterior of new claim of decay

893
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:41,200
to the posterior of new claim of decay it is the same 12 as the priors that we

894
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,460
it is the same 12 as the priors that we use from your lambda

895
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,590
use from your lambda the only differences the parameters

896
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:51,610
the only differences the parameters because 0 and mu 0 etc or nu 0 w0 have

897
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:54,460
because 0 and mu 0 etc or nu 0 w0 have been updated now and this have sort of

898
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:58,420
been updated now and this have sort of the updates of the parameters so

899
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:02,950
the updates of the parameters so basically using conjugate priors gave a

900
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:05,500
basically using conjugate priors gave a similar variation approximation that is

901
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,930
similar variation approximation that is the same identical for all right so this

902
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:12,480
the same identical for all right so this is very nice

903
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:12,490


904
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:24,420
okay and all right so we're gonna keep going back reports again all right so

905
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,490
going back reports again all right so tell me is the conversation here

906
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,080
tell me is the conversation here we need to go back to another question

907
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,270
we need to go back to another question over the responsibilities and I'm gonna

908
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,580
over the responsibilities and I'm gonna put all of these things up so to say

909
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,260
put all of these things up so to say that the relationship immediately

910
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:40,680
that the relationship immediately algebra so remember the of this

911
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,640
algebra so remember the of this responsibilities this out we are

912
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,800
responsibilities this out we are normalized us from civilities requires

913
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,570
normalized us from civilities requires the expectation of the log of I claim

914
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,880
the expectation of the log of I claim requires the expectation of the line of

915
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,340
requires the expectation of the line of this matrices lambda K and the

916
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,140
this matrices lambda K and the expectation with respect to me along to

917
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:58,000
expectation with respect to me along to exist okay so you know what you need to

918
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,960
exist okay so you know what you need to have taught us to do this algebra so

919
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,700
have taught us to do this algebra so let's complete this you need the

920
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:11,620
let's complete this you need the expectation respect to me Atlanta which

921
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:14,140
expectation respect to me Atlanta which is fundamental basically do every time

922
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,340
is fundamental basically do every time you see this form and you have an

923
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,950
you see this form and you have an expectation I have written this as the

924
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:20,280
expectation I have written this as the parish of lambda times xx transpose

925
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,020
parish of lambda times xx transpose have you seen that before it's a

926
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,000
have you seen that before it's a fundamental take basic and everywhere

927
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,120
fundamental take basic and everywhere when you get this you write it when you

928
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,160
when you get this you write it when you have X transpose lambda times X you I

929
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,680
have X transpose lambda times X you I this as the trace of lambda X X

930
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,810
this as the trace of lambda X X transpose okay and then we need

931
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:36,250
transpose okay and then we need expectation with the posterior of

932
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:38,130
expectation with the posterior of mylanta we use the variational

933
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,900
mylanta we use the variational approximation of those so we're gonna

934
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,730
approximation of those so we're gonna first an integration McCadden an

935
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:49,840
first an integration McCadden an integration in you need this you need to

936
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,960
integration in you need this you need to know the mean of the ways of

937
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,960
know the mean of the ways of distribution to do that so this

938
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,540
distribution to do that so this basically if you use the properties of

939
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,849
basically if you use the properties of the wizard distribution are no problem

940
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:07,349
the wizard distribution are no problem and it remains we need to calculate this

941
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:13,499
and it remains we need to calculate this expectation of the lava pie PA all right

942
00:53:13,499 --> 00:53:19,589
expectation of the lava pie PA all right okay so all right you can I am NOT going

943
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:22,289
okay so all right you can I am NOT going to elaborate on this okay for this if

944
00:53:22,289 --> 00:53:25,349
to elaborate on this okay for this if you study in Wikipedia the declared this

945
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:28,859
you study in Wikipedia the declared this tradition this expectation of a lot of

946
00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:31,199
tradition this expectation of a lot of Pi clay comes to be basically the body

947
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:34,319
Pi clay comes to be basically the body gamma function computed on alpha t minus

948
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:38,129
gamma function computed on alpha t minus the sonographer case this is the by

949
00:53:38,129 --> 00:53:41,669
the sonographer case this is the by gamma function and and then we have to

950
00:53:41,669 --> 00:53:45,479
gamma function and and then we have to complete this pain prepare but you never

951
00:53:45,479 --> 00:53:47,909
complete this pain prepare but you never satanic or in any machine landing book

952
00:53:47,909 --> 00:53:49,739
satanic or in any machine landing book actually remember he has this

953
00:53:49,739 --> 00:53:52,109
actually remember he has this calculations explicitly but you will

954
00:53:52,109 --> 00:53:54,989
calculations explicitly but you will never take a discussion of how you

955
00:53:54,989 --> 00:53:58,620
never take a discussion of how you compute the expectation with respect to

956
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,259
compute the expectation with respect to ways of distribution of the love of the

957
00:54:01,259 --> 00:54:07,349
ways of distribution of the love of the determinant of a wizard distribution all

958
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:14,999
determinant of a wizard distribution all right okay so so there is we are think

959
00:54:14,999 --> 00:54:18,959
right okay so so there is we are think okay and I am NOT going to am I going

960
00:54:18,959 --> 00:54:25,319
okay and I am NOT going to am I going backwards yeah no okay so so this is

961
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:27,059
backwards yeah no okay so so this is what we need we need to calculate the

962
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:29,789
what we need we need to calculate the expectation of this lovicott determinant

963
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:32,399
expectation of this lovicott determinant by the Council of the Gaussian with

964
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:35,099
by the Council of the Gaussian with respect to this the balanced addition of

965
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:37,499
respect to this the balanced addition of lambda which the wizard okay and I

966
00:54:37,499 --> 00:54:39,359
lambda which the wizard okay and I remember when I first open this you know

967
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:47,429
remember when I first open this you know three years ago you know the miracles of

968
00:54:47,429 --> 00:54:50,939
three years ago you know the miracles of Google okay I came across a reference

969
00:54:50,939 --> 00:54:55,139
Google okay I came across a reference but basically you can approximate this

970
00:54:55,139 --> 00:54:59,759
but basically you can approximate this as a sum of beauty square distributions

971
00:54:59,759 --> 00:55:02,879
as a sum of beauty square distributions and with some trivial answer actually

972
00:55:02,879 --> 00:55:04,409
and with some trivial answer actually which is on this slide that I'm not

973
00:55:04,409 --> 00:55:06,269
which is on this slide that I'm not going to elaborate you can actually

974
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:11,449
going to elaborate you can actually compute analytically the expectation of

975
00:55:11,449 --> 00:55:13,310
compute analytically the expectation of value

976
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,670
value the determinant of Lanka and this is the

977
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:18,740
the determinant of Lanka and this is the expression well again this is the by

978
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:22,280
expression well again this is the by gamma distribution obviously here my

979
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,470
gamma distribution obviously here my parentheses should be inside the

980
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:27,550
parentheses should be inside the argument they're gonna miss it so

981
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:31,190
argument they're gonna miss it so everything on this okay can be

982
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:33,380
everything on this okay can be calculated and I'm going to give you a

983
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,630
calculated and I'm going to give you a very compact oh and the very compact

984
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:38,830
very compact oh and the very compact point is what you see on the bottom okay

985
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:42,830
point is what you see on the bottom okay so this involves this cherry pie which

986
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:45,230
so this involves this cherry pie which we define it here to be the exponential

987
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:50,030
we define it here to be the exponential of this expectation this charaluta that

988
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:51,860
of this expectation this charaluta that we define to be the exponential of this

989
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:55,190
we define to be the exponential of this expectation and then this term inside

990
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:59,000
expectation and then this term inside we're Nikkei is mu 0 plus n K all right

991
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,680
we're Nikkei is mu 0 plus n K all right which are this idea so basically I can

992
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,600
which are this idea so basically I can find this line that is a summary of

993
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:12,680
find this line that is a summary of everything this is you can program it in

994
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:18,650
everything this is you can program it in in a few minutes okay right somebody

995
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:20,810
in a few minutes okay right somebody gives you we actually passed any of this

996
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:25,900
gives you we actually passed any of this result I would know okay now this is

997
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:29,450
result I would know okay now this is written as an easter time step because

998
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:31,190
written as an easter time step because of the similarities with the expectation

999
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:37,460
of the similarities with the expectation maximization so in the easter you have

1000
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,070
maximization so in the easter you have become a basically the responsibilities

1001
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:42,020
become a basically the responsibilities and to give make the responsibilities

1002
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:45,680
and to give make the responsibilities you need these expectations this cherry

1003
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,640
you need these expectations this cherry pie and the can be lambda K and this is

1004
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,250
pie and the can be lambda K and this is the formula for these responsibilities

1005
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,290
the formula for these responsibilities whereas we have the responsibilities we

1006
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:56,390
whereas we have the responsibilities we can bring the m-step calculate the

1007
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:57,800
can bring the m-step calculate the attractive number of points on its

1008
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,770
attractive number of points on its Gaussian carry the effective mean values

1009
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:03,110
Gaussian carry the effective mean values and variance and update all the

1010
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:04,910
and variance and update all the parameters and then you keep iterating

1011
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:10,950
parameters and then you keep iterating and human converts okay you win converts

1012
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:10,960


1013
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,859
and again as I mentioned this compressions have been extended to

1014
00:57:16,859 --> 00:57:19,740
compressions have been extended to anything he makes Raghava processes and

1015
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,910
anything he makes Raghava processes and variation have been extended also to an

1016
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:25,299
variation have been extended also to an infinite in thousand distributions and

1017
00:57:25,299 --> 00:57:27,370
infinite in thousand distributions and alternately makes mixture of Gaussian

1018
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:30,990
alternately makes mixture of Gaussian processes okay

1019
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:38,200
processes okay an example is a Python code okay I'm

1020
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,270
an example is a Python code okay I'm gonna pass this right actually on this

1021
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:43,059
gonna pass this right actually on this slide some of the equations but I'm not

1022
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:45,370
slide some of the equations but I'm not gonna show you today they somehow don't

1023
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,870
gonna show you today they somehow don't show very well because they were typed

1024
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:50,020
show very well because they were typed on there on a Mac so they I need to sort

1025
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:54,599
on there on a Mac so they I need to sort of revive some of their questions but

1026
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:56,770
of revive some of their questions but you know we will fix it today so

1027
00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:00,040
you know we will fix it today so hopefully so who's that so an example

1028
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,370
hopefully so who's that so an example that has an issue of 6,000 so these are

1029
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:06,849
that has an issue of 6,000 so these are my data points and the ellipses that you

1030
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:08,500
my data points and the ellipses that you will see is basically one side of the

1031
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,650
will see is basically one side of the nation density controls each of the

1032
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:15,299
nation density controls each of the parents I caused that has already

1033
00:58:15,299 --> 00:58:18,880
parents I caused that has already alright that inside it's eclipse that

1034
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,289
alright that inside it's eclipse that corresponds to the main content of the

1035
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:24,400
corresponds to the main content of the mix equation and this is when you start

1036
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,920
mix equation and this is when you start alright so these are the prior makes

1037
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,130
alright so these are the prior makes partitions but as we we will continue

1038
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,349
partitions but as we we will continue this this will be the color will be

1039
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:34,000
this this will be the color will be based on the posterior responsibilities

1040
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:42,670
based on the posterior responsibilities so this is this is not okay this is

1041
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:47,140
so this is this is not okay this is iteration 15 okay on this are the

1042
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:50,049
iteration 15 okay on this are the different Gaussian basically but you

1043
00:58:50,049 --> 00:58:54,370
different Gaussian basically but you compute this situation 60 and this

1044
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:57,940
compute this situation 60 and this situation 120 so basically the model

1045
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:01,030
situation 120 so basically the model collapse from 2000 now you know what

1046
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:03,309
collapse from 2000 now you know what happened you know you say I have a

1047
00:59:03,309 --> 00:59:03,920
happened you know you say I have a mixture

1048
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,920
mixture collapse on on two gaussians well yeah

1049
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,220
collapse on on two gaussians well yeah because this players that we have used

1050
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:17,210
because this players that we have used for you know they enforce with the

1051
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:20,360
for you know they enforce with the buzzword supposed to do okay so the

1052
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,340
buzzword supposed to do okay so the spires we use basically kills some of

1053
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,650
spires we use basically kills some of the components okay

1054
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,840
the components okay and the misny that's why he gives the

1055
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,280
and the misny that's why he gives the same ideas right for the name cream

1056
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,050
same ideas right for the name cream actually remember I have and into a

1057
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:34,910
actually remember I have and into a mixed so you say hundred you well 1200

1058
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:37,280
mixed so you say hundred you well 1200 would go down to five ten you know so

1059
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,820
would go down to five ten you know so here it goes down to to 120 without you

1060
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:44,660
here it goes down to to 120 without you having to do so the city is Islam sort

1061
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:49,610
having to do so the city is Islam sort of not in in a sort of violent way say

1062
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:52,760
of not in in a sort of violent way say use two components it's mostly the two

1063
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,170
use two components it's mostly the two components are not coming because the

1064
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:00,740
components are not coming because the responsibilities taken for the data

1065
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,570
responsibilities taken for the data points are basically zero alright

1066
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:14,170
points are basically zero alright there's zero these block okay this is

1067
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:14,180


1068
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:23,390
and again alright survives you to describe look at

1069
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:37,300
alright survives you to describe look at this code right thing works okay so

1070
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:37,310


1071
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:43,040
component survived all right and it takes so much of it relations ninety

1072
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:47,150
takes so much of it relations ninety iterations you notice this is the an in

1073
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,220
iterations you notice this is the an in opposite monotonically increases okay

1074
01:00:49,220 --> 01:01:01,410
opposite monotonically increases okay and this is this would work here

1075
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:01,420


1076
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:11,110
so this time if you know of this different basically I supposed this

1077
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:13,060
different basically I supposed this isn't the postilion values of alpha

1078
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:13,840
isn't the postilion values of alpha chainsaw

1079
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,720
chainsaw okay the Brazilian values of alpha K and

1080
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,620
okay the Brazilian values of alpha K and you notice eventually you know after

1081
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,330
you notice eventually you know after interation 94 so this is some

1082
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:25,240
interation 94 so this is some intermediate response iteration after

1083
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:29,010
intermediate response iteration after iteration 912 only 2000 volunteers

1084
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:32,020
iteration 912 only 2000 volunteers survived okay so this actually may be

1085
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:35,020
survived okay so this actually may be the same data set as the one I saw you

1086
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:38,680
the same data set as the one I saw you with the Python code just a few seconds

1087
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:46,650
with the Python code just a few seconds ago

1088
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:46,660


1089
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:54,170
don't want to say anything about okay

1090
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:54,180


1091
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:59,220
let me see what else I know where what I need to tell you

1092
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:03,390
need to tell you so we need to you may ask me since you

1093
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:07,220
so we need to you may ask me since you got very excited with this you may say

1094
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:12,780
got very excited with this you may say an evaluation all right who is the

1095
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:15,180
an evaluation all right who is the distribution is there any hope drops

1096
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:18,210
distribution is there any hope drops recompute any of them telling me I've no

1097
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:22,650
recompute any of them telling me I've no example slide 47 because obviously

1098
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:27,960
example slide 47 because obviously what's the perfect ultra-light would say

1099
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,570
what's the perfect ultra-light would say here is how the data fit you know in so

1100
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:32,640
here is how the data fit you know in so many components where I'm interested to

1101
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:39,030
many components where I'm interested to know is can actually compute the

1102
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:45,770
know is can actually compute the posterior of a new data point okay so

1103
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:50,250
posterior of a new data point okay so this equation so this is the posterior

1104
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,710
this equation so this is the posterior distribution tell me exactly everything

1105
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:56,190
distribution tell me exactly everything you see on this equation isopropyl

1106
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:58,740
you see on this equation isopropyl integrates information on Z so tell me

1107
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:01,790
integrates information on Z so tell me exactly what's going on their

1108
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:09,260
exactly what's going on their distribution

1109
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:09,270


1110
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:14,960
what's the predictive distribution

1111
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:14,970


1112
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:19,620
parameters and length and variables so these are the parameters right and this

1113
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:21,480
these are the parameters right and this C heart is the latent variable

1114
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,060
C heart is the latent variable corresponding to X heart in other words

1115
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:28,820
corresponding to X heart in other words if I knew that that component you know

1116
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:31,020
if I knew that that component you know complain to the mixture of generates the

1117
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:33,270
complain to the mixture of generates the point X 1/2 all right this would be the

1118
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:37,320
point X 1/2 all right this would be the likelihood or not right that's what we

1119
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,060
likelihood or not right that's what we must be an integration on all the

1120
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:42,420
must be an integration on all the unknowns including Z bar and I picked as

1121
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:44,310
unknowns including Z bar and I picked as a summation because the bar takes what

1122
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:49,910
a summation because the bar takes what values it's a it's a it's a

1123
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:53,510
values it's a it's a it's a you know so so I'm going it said this

1124
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:54,950
you know so so I'm going it said this country which I'm going to pick the

1125
01:03:54,950 --> 01:04:43,750
country which I'm going to pick the Grantham Z alright okay okay

1126
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:43,760


1127
01:04:43,760 --> 01:05:03,020
generated by this version the next coefficient by K and this will become

1128
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:12,290
coefficient by K and this will become this Gaussian and obviously this mistake

1129
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:14,720
this Gaussian and obviously this mistake is very complicated so we're going to

1130
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,660
is very complicated so we're going to approximate it with a variational

1131
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:21,950
approximate it with a variational distribution so Q PI Q mu K lambda K so

1132
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:25,010
distribution so Q PI Q mu K lambda K so this the distribution we welcome this

1133
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:30,040
this the distribution we welcome this remember we got this restrictor izing of

1134
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:34,420
remember we got this restrictor izing of Delta and Kelly and this came to be

1135
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:37,130
Delta and Kelly and this came to be optimization of the K of thousand wizard

1136
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:38,810
optimization of the K of thousand wizard distributions okay

1137
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,420
distributions okay and of course what they are now trying

1138
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:45,980
and of course what they are now trying to perform this integration right now

1139
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,450
to perform this integration right now what that means you never give up right

1140
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:50,150
what that means you never give up right because if the least a closed-form

1141
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:52,280
because if the least a closed-form solution and you go and you say now my

1142
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,230
solution and you go and you say now my references computer program to do this

1143
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:56,000
references computer program to do this people would be laughing is like you

1144
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,830
people would be laughing is like you must be kidding you know when we read

1145
01:05:57,830 --> 01:06:00,339
must be kidding you know when we read the book starts because there is a

1146
01:06:00,339 --> 01:06:04,180
the book starts because there is a mythical solution this can you guess I

1147
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,249
mythical solution this can you guess I mean before I show you anything can you

1148
01:06:06,249 --> 01:06:09,219
mean before I show you anything can you guess you know it's just from your birth

1149
01:06:09,219 --> 01:06:11,019
guess you know it's just from your birth time scale what type of distribution

1150
01:06:11,019 --> 01:06:15,640
time scale what type of distribution this may come to be I mean just yes so

1151
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,200
this may come to be I mean just yes so again we have a browse unique slots

1152
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,019
again we have a browse unique slots heart rate right okay components and now

1153
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:22,180
heart rate right okay components and now we try to produce from you X you know

1154
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:25,210
we try to produce from you X you know what's the probability what do you think

1155
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:26,920
what's the probability what do you think is going to happen I mean just give you

1156
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,640
is going to happen I mean just give you some choices

1157
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:33,789
some choices let me account so the level is just

1158
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:36,249
let me account so the level is just again it collapse to some mixed of some

1159
01:06:36,249 --> 01:06:39,039
again it collapse to some mixed of some capital K components so what will the

1160
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:41,529
capital K components so what will the predictive distribution look like at the

1161
01:06:41,529 --> 01:06:47,569
predictive distribution look like at the end of the day

1162
01:06:47,569 --> 01:06:47,579


1163
01:06:47,579 --> 01:06:57,610
I'm not surprised you know anyways

1164
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:57,620


1165
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:04,410
well discipline is sing to you through it becomes to the mix of gaussians

1166
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:04,420


1167
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:09,220
mixture of gaussians no I mean it will not surprise me

1168
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,110
not surprise me and that's how it doesn't come to be a

1169
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,760
and that's how it doesn't come to be a minister of gaussians unless you have a

1170
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:16,240
minister of gaussians unless you have a lots of data but it goes to the next

1171
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:21,820
lots of data but it goes to the next third of what distribution what what is

1172
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:25,720
third of what distribution what what is very close to browse it didn't take this

1173
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:29,950
very close to browse it didn't take this to be a okay so it comes to be a mixture

1174
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:32,890
to be a okay so it comes to be a mixture of didn t distributions and only on the

1175
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:34,660
of didn t distributions and only on the limit of you only have a lots of data so

1176
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,510
limit of you only have a lots of data so the prior effects basically disappear

1177
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:47,190
the prior effects basically disappear this qt- becomes a Gaussian it and okay

1178
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:47,200


1179
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:53,740
the answer bar is actually it's not as painful as I make it to look like right

1180
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:59,020
painful as I make it to look like right so you will you need basically the

1181
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,060
so you will you need basically the expectations of this coefficients YK

1182
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:04,420
expectations of this coefficients YK coming from the declare distribution you

1183
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,550
coming from the declare distribution you will need basically to work with this

1184
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:14,350
will need basically to work with this okay and so you can see actually we know

1185
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:16,360
okay and so you can see actually we know it comes that the predictive

1186
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,060
it comes that the predictive distribution is an integration of the

1187
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:22,690
distribution is an integration of the lambda of the for each K lambda K over

1188
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:27,160
lambda of the for each K lambda K over diffusion okay but we precision that you

1189
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:30,270
diffusion okay but we precision that you see here that's a wizard distribution

1190
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:36,190
see here that's a wizard distribution okay so again it is an integration of

1191
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:39,849
okay so again it is an integration of Atlanta of gaussians with Wizards you

1192
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:41,860
Atlanta of gaussians with Wizards you know actually mattresses and actually I

1193
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:43,420
know actually mattresses and actually I should have given you this is a homework

1194
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:46,120
should have given you this is a homework right in an ideal environment because

1195
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:51,310
right in an ideal environment because seeing even in bishops book it it has a

1196
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:54,670
seeing even in bishops book it it has a little example that

1197
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:57,340
little example that you know when the hint reduces for

1198
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,990
you know when the hint reduces for remember we all like chapter 2

1199
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:04,240
remember we all like chapter 2 introduces the student t distribution

1200
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,770
introduces the student t distribution you know how he introduces it as a

1201
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,380
you know how he introduces it as a mixture of gaussians for the precision

1202
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:14,080
mixture of gaussians for the precision in the mixture so that components in the

1203
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,570
in the mixture so that components in the mixture of what they are gamma

1204
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,600
mixture of what they are gamma distributions

1205
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,730
distributions so actually obviously you can see here

1206
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:24,130
so actually obviously you can see here if you have a multivariate Gaussian

1207
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:28,210
if you have a multivariate Gaussian right and you take for this for this

1208
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:32,050
right and you take for this for this precision a wizard you know you will get

1209
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:34,150
precision a wizard you know you will get a student T distribution a multivariate

1210
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:36,760
a student T distribution a multivariate unity distribution okay if you don't

1211
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,780
unity distribution okay if you don't believe me look on chapter 2 where she

1212
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:45,510
believe me look on chapter 2 where she introduces a student P you know with

1213
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:48,340
introduces a student P you know with sort of this construct that in one

1214
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:50,620
sort of this construct that in one dimension I think so basically here

1215
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:54,300
dimension I think so basically here we'll we have this exact the same thing

1216
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:58,090
we'll we have this exact the same thing we you know student eat some trivial

1217
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:01,000
we you know student eat some trivial algebra basically looking on how much

1218
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,790
algebra basically looking on how much the distribution looks like

1219
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:05,800


1220
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:21,100
okay okay the membership today comes from the display posterior and we write

1221
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,020
from the display posterior and we write the coefficients in the Dirac

1222
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:25,210
the coefficients in the Dirac distribution I have times the sum of

1223
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:26,830
distribution I have times the sum of application so these are the mixture

1224
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:30,480
application so these are the mixture components and then I have the student T

1225
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:35,470
components and then I have the student T with a precision basically that is given

1226
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:37,330
with a precision basically that is given by this formula and the bomb in your

1227
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:41,320
by this formula and the bomb in your case we had completed them before from

1228
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,510
case we had completed them before from these labs and wizard distribution okay

1229
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:47,140
these labs and wizard distribution okay so very nice formula okay all right I

1230
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:49,690
so very nice formula okay all right I don't know why so negative put okay so

1231
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:52,450
don't know why so negative put okay so this is it's an approximation obviously

1232
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:54,089
this is it's an approximation obviously of the predicted

1233
01:10:54,089 --> 01:10:55,950
of the predicted tribution it's an approximation because

1234
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:58,560
tribution it's an approximation because the percent of the parameters we use was

1235
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,479
the percent of the parameters we use was not the exact posterior it was the

1236
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:03,990
not the exact posterior it was the variation approximation okay so these

1237
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:10,379
variation approximation okay so these exercises in in the notes so you're

1238
01:11:10,379 --> 01:11:12,930
exercises in in the notes so you're interested what you can do this and

1239
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:15,990
interested what you can do this and again it's a very nice exercise if you

1240
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:19,350
again it's a very nice exercise if you look at this formula and take let me

1241
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:20,879
look at this formula and take let me look at the other parameters what

1242
01:11:20,879 --> 01:11:23,609
look at the other parameters what happens when I have a lots of data so

1243
01:11:23,609 --> 01:11:25,410
happens when I have a lots of data so when you take have to go to infinity or

1244
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:27,180
when you take have to go to infinity or I usually have a lots of data you can

1245
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:29,510
I usually have a lots of data you can say with some trivial calculations

1246
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:33,689
say with some trivial calculations basically that this predicting posterior

1247
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:37,140
basically that this predicting posterior distribution comes to be a mixture of

1248
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:42,120
distribution comes to be a mixture of options okay and you could have some

1249
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,700
options okay and you could have some even have just this officer alright

1250
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,950
even have just this officer alright because you know if you have a list to

1251
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:48,810
because you know if you have a list to data to get all the powers forget

1252
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:51,290
data to get all the powers forget everything you know what then you think

1253
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:54,240
everything you know what then you think so every dollar cell is defined by the

1254
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,160
so every dollar cell is defined by the averages of the points like when we play

1255
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,959
averages of the points like when we play Nia that belongs to the Gaussian with

1256
01:11:57,959 --> 01:12:01,530
Nia that belongs to the Gaussian with this covariance okay and then basically

1257
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:04,109
this covariance okay and then basically the mixing questions is the persons

1258
01:12:04,109 --> 01:12:06,359
the mixing questions is the persons having that component there's the total

1259
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:09,149
having that component there's the total number of points okay I mean you know

1260
01:12:09,149 --> 01:12:11,370
number of points okay I mean you know you could have you know if you can its

1261
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:14,399
you could have you know if you can its money to predict what's to know this

1262
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:17,760
money to predict what's to know this answer this is a price they did promise

1263
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,609
answer this is a price they did promise me if you try to do the answer block and

1264
01:12:20,609 --> 01:12:25,410
me if you try to do the answer block and then you get some water and when you

1265
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:27,569
then you get some water and when you have a lots of vapor you don't bother to

1266
01:12:27,569 --> 01:12:32,339
have a lots of vapor you don't bother to say is this correct in other ways is it

1267
01:12:32,339 --> 01:12:33,780
say is this correct in other ways is it going to give me a bit if it is not

1268
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,010
going to give me a bit if it is not going to give you that you know

1269
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:36,419
going to give you that you know something is very wrong with the algebra

1270
01:12:36,419 --> 01:12:39,209
something is very wrong with the algebra okay so in this case when you take the

1271
01:12:39,209 --> 01:12:41,729
okay so in this case when you take the limit to lots of data the algebra comes

1272
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:45,089
limit to lots of data the algebra comes to be correct to do this limit you have

1273
01:12:45,089 --> 01:12:48,209
to be correct to do this limit you have and I

1274
01:12:48,209 --> 01:12:52,109
and I you know encourage you to try I mean no

1275
01:12:52,109 --> 01:12:54,569
you know encourage you to try I mean no everything's in the nose at least pull

1276
01:12:54,569 --> 01:12:58,949
everything's in the nose at least pull it and then get dizzy okay so if you

1277
01:12:58,949 --> 01:13:01,799
it and then get dizzy okay so if you follow the algebra you have to use nice

1278
01:13:01,799 --> 01:13:03,810
follow the algebra you have to use nice approximations you know I can see

1279
01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:05,850
approximations you know I can see because there's run of actions you have

1280
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:07,859
because there's run of actions you have you Steve thinks approximation formula

1281
01:13:07,859 --> 01:13:12,779
you Steve thinks approximation formula and approximation kolento paste it

1282
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:14,399
and approximation kolento paste it consists of basically all the posterior

1283
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:17,100
consists of basically all the posterior distribution because you are the limit

1284
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,709
distribution because you are the limit of many data become Delta functions and

1285
01:13:19,709 --> 01:13:21,299
of many data become Delta functions and at the end of the day without the

1286
01:13:21,299 --> 01:13:28,470
at the end of the day without the function you get right up okay

1287
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:32,130
function you get right up okay all right I don't really have any

1288
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:34,110
all right I don't really have any minutes so we might tell you we need to

1289
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:37,760
minutes so we might tell you we need to do we need to go back whistling was it

1290
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:42,420
do we need to go back whistling was it 16 thank you continue you can generalize

1291
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:57,479
16 thank you continue you can generalize this and okay okay

1292
01:13:57,479 --> 01:13:57,489


1293
01:13:57,489 --> 01:14:06,040
because rate and the likes you can actually generalize this for many many

1294
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:12,430
actually generalize this for many many problems for situations where the joint

1295
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:15,129
problems for situations where the joint affection Z or I come from the

1296
01:14:15,129 --> 01:14:18,939
affection Z or I come from the exponential problem okay and I think

1297
01:14:18,939 --> 01:14:22,390
exponential problem okay and I think it's many distributions so wherever here

1298
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:26,250
it's many distributions so wherever here is I expand the joint likelihood alright

1299
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,839
is I expand the joint likelihood alright in the form of an exponential family

1300
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:31,240
in the form of an exponential family distribution so these are the sufficient

1301
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,910
distribution so these are the sufficient statistics it are the natural parameter

1302
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:36,640
statistics it are the natural parameter this organization factor this the

1303
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:42,129
this organization factor this the function fraction is d right so so

1304
01:14:42,129 --> 01:14:44,319
function fraction is d right so so actually in the new knowledge okay that

1305
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:48,040
actually in the new knowledge okay that when I gave you you can use so that this

1306
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,540
when I gave you you can use so that this creative innovation will hang on the

1307
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:53,080
creative innovation will hang on the next slide actually Nations we did for

1308
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,270
next slide actually Nations we did for the multi body of value alright because

1309
01:14:55,270 --> 01:15:08,160
the multi body of value alright because this is a very general problem okay so

1310
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:08,170


1311
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:14,109
the results from the exponential family so you talk to the information from

1312
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:17,890
so you talk to the information from there alright so the statistics here

1313
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:23,620
there alright so the statistics here really become new 0 X 0 ok this museum

1314
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:30,669
really become new 0 X 0 ok this museum becomes your prior and an f of X 0 u 0

1315
01:15:30,669 --> 01:15:35,290
becomes your prior and an f of X 0 u 0 okay so you can read bishops you can

1316
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:37,540
okay so you can read bishops you can look at my notes in the fall formal

1317
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,220
look at my notes in the fall formal information of the exponential family

1318
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:42,459
information of the exponential family but basically you can put in this for

1319
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:45,220
but basically you can put in this for many distributions right so the question

1320
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:48,339
many distributions right so the question is can you actually divide by a small

1321
01:15:48,339 --> 01:15:52,419
is can you actually divide by a small difference approximations this general

1322
01:15:52,419 --> 01:15:55,259
difference approximations this general scenario if we can

1323
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:57,989
scenario if we can we have seen about 50 problems all in

1324
01:15:57,989 --> 01:16:02,370
we have seen about 50 problems all in one slide and the answer yes you can

1325
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:04,979
one slide and the answer yes you can so what you have to do to be put on

1326
01:16:04,979 --> 01:16:09,290
so what you have to do to be put on everything up because the time is over

1327
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:09,300


1328
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:17,759
okay okay you have to use exactly the same ideas as before right

1329
01:16:17,759 --> 01:16:20,669
same ideas as before right so you capitalize this as Q of Z times Q

1330
01:16:20,669 --> 01:16:23,250
so you capitalize this as Q of Z times Q fitnah and you are looking for kids in

1331
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,169
fitnah and you are looking for kids in your people to be the exponential colony

1332
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:27,209
your people to be the exponential colony and surprise surprise cubes it'll be

1333
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:29,819
and surprise surprise cubes it'll be optimal comes to be exactly exponential

1334
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:31,379
optimal comes to be exactly exponential family the only thing you need is the

1335
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:34,200
family the only thing you need is the expectation of the parameters and QP

1336
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,879
expectation of the parameters and QP become so should be the exponential

1337
01:16:35,879 --> 01:16:39,600
become so should be the exponential family and you can see the updates are

1338
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,669
family and you can see the updates are standard and the only thing you need is

1339
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:44,339
standard and the only thing you need is the expectation with respect to Z of the

1340
01:16:44,339 --> 01:16:47,339
the expectation with respect to Z of the sufficient statistics here affection and

1341
01:16:47,339 --> 01:16:51,419
sufficient statistics here affection and Xia okay so basically the problem where

1342
01:16:51,419 --> 01:16:53,459
Xia okay so basically the problem where this distribution is the exponential

1343
01:16:53,459 --> 01:16:56,069
this distribution is the exponential family conflicting with in this

1344
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:58,439
family conflicting with in this variation of observation in a certain

1345
01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:00,779
variation of observation in a certain area in step where you compute this

1346
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:05,370
area in step where you compute this expectation using P of Z N and then you

1347
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:09,330
expectation using P of Z N and then you plug this same here and you compute this

1348
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:11,100
plug this same here and you compute this variation distribution actually the only

1349
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,439
variation distribution actually the only thing you need is you need the

1350
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:15,930
thing you need is you need the expectation of beta so you eat the rate

1351
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:19,799
expectation of beta so you eat the rate and you can get you know height you can

1352
01:17:19,799 --> 01:17:21,270
and you can get you know height you can get two results for multi variate

1353
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:25,379
get two results for multi variate thousand you can get the result any

1354
01:17:25,379 --> 01:17:27,270
thousand you can get the result any distribution any example that we see in

1355
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:29,939
distribution any example that we see in the literature you can use this prognost

1356
01:17:29,939 --> 01:17:33,750
the literature you can use this prognost and it will fit in all right so I'm

1357
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:38,419
and it will fit in all right so I'm gonna leave and we're gonna use the

1358
01:17:38,419 --> 01:17:44,180
gonna leave and we're gonna use the enjoy Friday happy Easter and see you on

1359
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:47,720
enjoy Friday happy Easter and see you on Tuesday

1360
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:47,730


1361
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:54,620
  I like it
