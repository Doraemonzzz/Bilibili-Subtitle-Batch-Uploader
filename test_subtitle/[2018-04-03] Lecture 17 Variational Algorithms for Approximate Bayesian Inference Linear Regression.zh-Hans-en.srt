197
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:11,800
好的，这是正确的说法，不正确，这是一个近似值
no it's not right it's an approximation that's what variation of variational

198
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,060

approximations are about they are approximate methods all right so we

201
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,800
好的近似方法，所以我们将这个后验分解为

为什么不期望W
why don't in expectation of W

247
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,930
好的，谢谢你，我的意思是我的东西正确
why don't in expectation of W

thank you all right I mean something right in my

250
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:04,559
好的，谢谢你，我的意思是我的东西正确
all right I mean something right in my eyes looks wrong I have to think myself

251
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,129
眼睛看起来不对劲，我必须考虑一下自己，这样也很好，
all right I mean something right in my eyes looks wrong I have to think myself

252
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:09,259
眼睛看起来不对劲，我必须考虑一下自己，这样也很好，
eyes looks wrong I have to think myself so it's good that your things up too and

253
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:09,269
眼睛看起来不对劲，我必须考虑一下自己，这样也很好，
so it's good that your things up too and you say oh he's paid all right but it's

254
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:12,229
你说哦，他还清所有款项，但这显然不是一个错误，所以当
so it's good that your things up too and you say oh he's paid all right but it's

255
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:15,650
你说哦，他还清所有款项，但这显然不是一个错误，所以当
you say oh he's paid all right but it's obviously not a mistake okay so when

256
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:15,660
你说哦，他还清所有款项，但这显然不是一个错误，所以当
obviously not a mistake okay so when remember the constant terms are things

257
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,229
记住常数项是要依赖的东西，例如也许只是我在这里
obviously not a mistake okay so when remember the constant terms are things

258
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:21,679
记住常数项是要依赖的东西，例如也许只是我在这里
remember the constant terms are things to depend for example maybe just me here

259
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:21,689
记住常数项是要依赖的东西，例如也许只是我在这里
to depend for example maybe just me here and there constant times really and we

260
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:24,799
确实有固定的时间，我们不在乎，因为这是分布
to depend for example maybe just me here and there constant times really and we

261
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,239
确实有固定的时间，我们不在乎，因为这是分布
and there constant times really and we don't care because this is distribution

262
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:26,249
确实有固定的时间，我们不在乎，因为这是分布
don't care because this is distribution on alpha the only way she will keep this

263
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:28,549
在Alpha上，她保留此唯一方法是因为您要放置Alpha，所以

264
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:30,710
在Alpha上，她保留此唯一方法是因为您要放置Alpha，所以
on alpha the only way she will keep this is because you want to place alpha so

265
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
在Alpha上，她保留此唯一方法是因为您要放置Alpha，所以
is because you want to place alpha so you can email you see you can combine

266
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,329
您可以发送电子邮件给您，看到您可以将此日志双点组合在一起，就可以
is because you want to place alpha so you can email you see you can combine

267

268
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:34,319
您可以发送电子邮件给您，看到您可以将此日志双点组合在一起，就可以
this log double dot there you can combine this constant however this term

269
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:36,079
结合这个常数，但是这个术语乘以alpha，基本上就是你得到的
this log double dot there you can combine this constant however this term

271
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:38,549
结合这个常数，但是这个术语乘以alpha，基本上就是你得到的
times alpha and basically what you get is the log of it when you gamma

272
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:40,159
是您使用更新参数进行伽玛分布时的日志，因此
times alpha and basically what you get is the log of it when you gamma

273

训练完系统后，您现在要在给定的XI上说，想知道
once you train the system you say now at the given X I want to know what the

367
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:47,910
训练完系统后，您现在要在给定的XI上说，想知道
the given X I want to know what the response is I'm taking the response yet

00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,389
回应是我正在接受回应，但尚未成为扫描程序，这赏金是
response is I'm taking the response yet to be scanner and this bounty is the

370
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:53,399
回应是我正在接受回应，但尚未成为扫描程序，这赏金是
to be scanner and this bounty is the data right so that's the prolific

371
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,090
正确的数据，因此这是多产的后验，因此基本上是
to be scanner and this bounty is the data right so that's the prolific

372
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,100
正确的数据，因此这是多产的后验，因此基本上是
data right so that's the prolific posterior so that's basically the

373
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,110
正确的数据，因此这是多产的后验，因此基本上是
posterior so that's basically the likelihood

374
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,169
如果您知道W，您为什么会得到
posterior so that's basically the likelihood

375
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:02,090
如果您知道W，您为什么会得到
likelihood why would you get if you if you know W

376
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:02,100
如果您知道W，您为什么会得到
why would you get if you if you know W times the posterior what all the

377
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,829
乘以后验是什么，所有的参数都被整合出来，
why would you get if you if you know W times the posterior what all the

378
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:06,139
乘以后验是什么，所有的参数都被整合出来，
times the posterior what all the parameters are integrated out and the

379
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:06,149
乘以后验是什么，所有的参数都被整合出来，
parameters are integrated out and the King radium here is we are not going to

380
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:08,389
镭王在这里是我们不会插入实际的后路
parameters are integrated out and the King radium here is we are not going to

381
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,360
镭王在这里是我们不会插入实际的后路
King radium here is we are not going to plug in the actual posterior

382
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,370
镭王在这里是我们不会插入实际的后路
plug in the actual posterior you actually plug in the variational

383
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,390
你实际上插入了变分近似值，这就是你的罂粟好吗
plug in the actual posterior you actually plug in the variational

384
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,910
你实际上插入了变分近似值，这就是你的罂粟好吗
you actually plug in the variational approximation which is your poppy okay

385
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,110
现在确切的Pastino是非常随和的高斯，所以我们可以
you actually plug in the variational approximation which is your poppy okay

386
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,120
现在确切的Pastino是非常随和的高斯，所以我们可以


387
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:28,250
现在确切的Pastino是非常随和的高斯，所以我们可以
now is the exact pastino is is very easygoing Gaussian so we could about

388
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:28,260
现在确切的Pastino是非常随和的高斯，所以我们可以
easygoing Gaussian so we could about this but here we demonstrate this is an

389
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,230
这个，但是在这里我们演示这是一个例子，所以您插入qw，这是
easygoing Gaussian so we could about this but here we demonstrate this is an

390
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,970
这个，但是在这里我们演示这是一个例子，所以您插入qw，这是
this but here we demonstrate this is an example so you plug in qw and this is

391
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:34,980
这个，但是在这里我们演示这是一个例子，所以您插入qw，这是
example so you plug in qw and this is the marginalization you remember you

392
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,980
边缘化，你记得你有最好的东西，拍卖有
example so you plug in qw and this is the marginalization you remember you

393
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,480
边缘化，你记得你有最好的东西，拍卖有
the marginalization you remember you have something best the auction has a

394
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:41,490
边缘化，你记得你有最好的东西，拍卖有
have something best the auction has a mean that's a linear function of gamma

395
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,070
就是说，这是伽玛nu的线性函数，然后你有x应该
have something best the auction has a mean that's a linear function of gamma

396
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,870
就是说，这是伽玛nu的线性函数，然后你有x应该
mean that's a linear function of gamma nu you know and then you have x should

397
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
就是说，这是伽玛nu的线性函数，然后你有x应该
nu you know and then you have x should not be an integration of that view right

398
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,600
不能整合这种观点，所以这确实是一个边际
nu you know and then you have x should not be an integration of that view right

399
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,670
不能整合这种观点，所以这确实是一个边际
not be an integration of that view right so this is really a marginal

400
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
不能整合这种观点，所以这确实是一个边际
so this is really a marginal distribution on P and if you look at the

401
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,480
分布在P上，如果您查看进度，方便的原始系统I
so this is really a marginal distribution on P and if you look at the

402
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,990
分布在P上，如果您查看进度，方便的原始系统I
distribution on P and if you look at the progress convenient origin systems I

403
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
分布在P上，如果您查看进度，方便的原始系统I
progress convenient origin systems I told you to have them perfect in your

404
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,329
告诉你让它们完美地放在你的书桌上
progress convenient origin systems I told you to have them perfect in your

405
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:00,740
告诉你让它们完美地放在你的书桌上
told you to have them perfect in your desk all right

406
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:00,750
告诉你让它们完美地放在你的书桌上
desk all right look at them every day because these

407
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,260
每天看看它们，因为您每天都会使用这些方程式十
desk all right look at them every day because these

408
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,150
每天看看它们，因为您每天都会使用这些方程式十
look at them every day because these equations you use them every day ten

409
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,160
每天看看它们，因为您每天都会使用这些方程式十
equations you use them every day ten times so you don't have to search okay

410
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,890
时间，因此您不必搜索就可以了，因此，如果将它们插入电源，便可以查看它们
equations you use them every day ten times so you don't have to search okay

411
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,680
时间，因此您不必搜索就可以了，因此，如果将它们插入电源，便可以查看它们
times so you don't have to search okay so you look at them if you plug them in

412
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:12,690
时间，因此您不必搜索就可以了，因此，如果将它们插入电源，便可以查看它们
so you look at them if you plug them in and basically you get another Gaussian

413
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,920
基本上你得到另一个高斯，你可以看到方差
so you look at them if you plug them in and basically you get another Gaussian

414
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,960
基本上你得到另一个高斯，你可以看到方差
and basically you get another Gaussian and you can see the the variance so of

415
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:20,970
基本上你得到另一个高斯，你可以看到方差
and you can see the the variance so of course dependent on X so it varies with

416
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,900
当然取决于X，所以它随X的变化而变化，如果再放一遍，一切都会好起来的
and you can see the the variance so of course dependent on X so it varies with

417
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,820
当然取决于X，所以它随X的变化而变化，如果再放一遍，一切都会好起来的
course dependent on X so it varies with X and if you put again things okay

418
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:28,830
当然取决于X，所以它随X的变化而变化，如果再放一遍，一切都会好起来的
X and if you put again things okay you will notice again that this matrix

419
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,370
您会再次注意到，该矩阵为n取决于您知道期望值
X and if you put again things okay you will notice again that this matrix

420
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,390
您会再次注意到，该矩阵为n取决于您知道期望值
you will notice again that this matrix is n depends on you know the expectation

421
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:35,400
您会再次注意到，该矩阵为n取决于您知道期望值
is n depends on you know the expectation of alpha and the design matrix P okay so

422
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,280
α和设计矩阵P的确定，所以很显然是对功率的期望
is n depends on you know the expectation of alpha and the design matrix P okay so

423
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,900
α和设计矩阵P的确定，所以很显然是对功率的期望
of alpha and the design matrix P okay so obviously the expectation of power power

424
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:41,910
α和设计矩阵P的确定，所以很显然是对功率的期望
obviously the expectation of power power we know it assuming we have computed the

425
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,100
假设我们已经计算了的变分近似，我们就知道了
obviously the expectation of power power we know it assuming we have computed the

426
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,620
假设我们已经计算了的变分近似，我们就知道了
we know it assuming we have computed the the variational approximation for of the

427
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:48,630
假设我们已经计算了的变分近似，我们就知道了
the variational approximation for of the posterior Palko okay the thing that I'm

did a very nice answer okay end of story okay and this is this

495
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:10,800
做了一个很好的答案，好了，故事结束了，这是这个
end of story okay and this is this rebound in connection so for example if

496
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,880
连接反弹，例如，如果您正在集成并且您有一个
end of story okay and this is this rebound in connection so for example if

501
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:20,920
一堆数据，您说您知道，假设您在这种情况下使用多项式
say you use polynomials in this case you say what's the other of polynomials that

502
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,590
说出我需要使用的多项式中的其他多项式更好地表示

509
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:43,380
因为它会不断增加，但是你永远不会消失，所以随着变化
because the will keep increasing but you will never fade okay so with variation

510
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:43,390
因为它会不断增加，但是你永远不会消失，所以随着变化
will never fade okay so with variation influenced and using these lower bounds

511
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,180
影响并使用案例的这些下限，您可以在这里看到它说
will never fade okay so with variation influenced and using these lower bounds

00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,970
影响并使用案例的这些下限，您可以在这里看到它说
influenced and using these lower bounds of the case and you can see here it says

513
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:47,980
影响并使用案例的这些下限，您可以在这里看到它说
of the case and you can see here it says M equal trees what explains the data

514
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,350
M个相等的树解释了数据还可以，我想我们已经讨论过了

and I may come back today also if you do notice election right and you put let's

519
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:04,390
如果您确实注意到选举权，并且我提出了，那么我今天也可能会回来
notice election right and you put let's say some vehicle prior over the space of

520
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,200
说一些车辆本质上在多项式数量的空间上
notice election right and you put let's say some vehicle prior over the space of

522
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:09,780
说一些车辆本质上在多项式数量的空间上
the number of polynomials in essence this this is you know very you know this

523
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:15,150
这是你知道的，你知道这个人口有效地给你
the number of polynomials in essence this this is you know very you know this

524
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,020
这是你知道的，你知道这个人口有效地给你
this this is you know very you know this population effectively gives you an

525
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,030
这是你知道的，你知道这个人口有效地给你
population effectively gives you an approximation to the posterior of the

526
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,180
近似于模型的后验，所以基本上这没什么
population effectively gives you an approximation to the posterior of the

527
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,390
近似于模型的后验，所以基本上这没什么
approximation to the posterior of the model right so basically this is nothing

528
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,400
近似于模型的后验，所以基本上这没什么
model right so basically this is nothing else but the posterior of the model with

529
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,040
否则，当您知道L 7等于3时，模型的后验与

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:31,480
否则，当您知道L 7等于3时，模型的后验与
when you know L 7 equal to three okay so this is a very nice way to do model

532
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,530
这是选择模型的好方法
when you know L 7 equal to three okay so this is a very nice way to do model

polynomial okay the lowest model is what you need but when you increase the

557
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,940
您需要，但是当您增加数据量时，例如在这里
you need but when you increase the number of data for example here it

558
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:28,950
您需要，但是当您增加数据量时，例如在这里
number of data for example here it immediately puts the posterior on m

559
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,460
立即将后验放在m等于3的极低点，它告诉您
number of data for example here it immediately puts the posterior on m

569
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,520
他们正在阅读机器学习的高个子，这基本上是
the tall they are reading machine learning looks this is basically the

570
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:55,530
他们正在阅读机器学习的高个子，这基本上是
learning looks this is basically the evidence approximation it doesn't do as

571
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,070
证据近似，效果也不佳
learning looks this is basically the evidence approximation it doesn't do as

evidence approximation it doesn't do as well

573
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:58,530
证据近似，效果也不佳
well so you can see for example in the

574
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,980
因此，例如，您可以在观察证据中看到
well so you can see for example in the

575
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,740
因此，例如，您可以在观察证据中看到
so you can see for example in the evidence of observation here it puts a

576
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:03,750
因此，例如，您可以在观察证据中看到
evidence of observation here it puts a lot on this posterior for m equal to R

577
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,560
这个后验的很多，m等于R，但是这里基本上可以说是当前

分布的我们有一些数据，因为在那种情况下是先验数据
in that case is the prior that dominate the

583
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,850
这个后验这里真的没有
in that case is the prior that dominate the

584
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,440
这个后验这里真的没有
this posterior here there's no really such a thing so this is not cool evasion

585
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,490
这样的事情，所以这不是很酷的逃避，而是这个很酷的逃避
this posterior here there's no really such a thing so this is not cool evasion

00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,039
爱情的几率，所以这有点像一个非常沉重，非常简单的图表，但是
probability of new given lambda and the probability of love so this is sort of a

731
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,999
爱情的几率，所以这有点像一个非常沉重，非常简单的图表，但是
probability of love so this is sort of a very heavy very simple graph but the

732
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:19,009
爱情的几率，所以这有点像一个非常沉重，非常简单的图表，但是
very heavy very simple graph but the calculation you will see it's not it's

733
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:23,080
计算，您会发现不是很痛苦
very heavy very simple graph but the calculation you will see it's not it's

734
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,950
计算，您会发现不是很痛苦
calculation you will see it's not it's painful

735
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:23,960
计算，您会发现不是很痛苦
painful okay but it is a calculation that again

736
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,860
好的，但这是一种计算，如果再次执行此操作，您将感觉到
painful okay but it is a calculation that again

737
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,070
好的，但这是一种计算，如果再次执行此操作，您将感觉到
okay but it is a calculation that again if you do it once you will get the sense

738
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,080
好的，但这是一种计算，如果再次执行此操作，您将感觉到
if you do it once you will get the sense of what it is and how it works

739
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,799
它是什么以及如何运作的，所以在我看来，例如
if you do it once you will get the sense of what it is and how it works

740
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,019
它是什么以及如何运作的，所以在我看来，例如
of what it is and how it works okay so in my view for example in the

741
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:38,029
它是什么以及如何运作的，所以在我看来，例如
okay so in my view for example in the midst of noxious right if you put this

742
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,490
如果把这个关节放在有害的权利中间
okay so in my view for example in the midst of noxious right if you put this

743
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,639
如果把这个关节放在有害的权利中间
midst of noxious right if you put this joint

744
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:42,649
如果把这个关节放在有害的权利中间
joint replica together this comes to be

745
00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:44,740
复制品一起成为高斯，如果条件作用一个
joint replica together this comes to be

746
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,490
复制品一起成为高斯，如果条件作用一个
replica together this comes to be Gaussian and if a condition actions a

747
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:48,500
复制品一起成为高斯，如果条件作用一个
Gaussian and if a condition actions a young get a gout okay

748
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,799
年轻人会痛风好吗
Gaussian and if a condition actions a young get a gout okay

749
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:54,870
条件很好，如果我整合拇指D好的，你不会走对的
Gaussian and if a condition actions a young get a gout okay

750
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:54,880
条件很好，如果我整合拇指D好的，你不会走对的


751
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,650
条件很好，如果我整合拇指D好的，你不会走对的
the condition excellency if I integrate thumbs D okay you're not gonna go right

752
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:01,660
条件很好，如果我整合拇指D好的，你不会走对的
thumbs D okay you're not gonna go right but the joint likelihood is a Gaussian

753
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,390
但是联合的可能性是高斯，这就是为什么我们运作良好，所以我想要
thumbs D okay you're not gonna go right but the joint likelihood is a Gaussian

754
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:11,160
但是联合的可能性是高斯，这就是为什么我们运作良好，所以我想要
but the joint likelihood is a Gaussian and that's why we operate okay so I want

755
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,170
但是联合的可能性是高斯，这就是为什么我们运作良好，所以我想要
and that's why we operate okay so I want you to look at this distribution that

756
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,630
你看看这个分布，告诉我你了解什么，所以px
and that's why we operate okay so I want you to look at this distribution that

757
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,830
你看看这个分布，告诉我你了解什么，所以px
you to look at this distribution that tells me what you understand it so px

758
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:16,840
你看看这个分布，告诉我你了解什么，所以px
tells me what you understand it so px given Z looks like that then you tell me

759
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:24,930
鉴于Z看起来像那样，那么你告诉我一切都不好
tells me what you understand it so px given Z looks like that then you tell me

760
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,840
鉴于Z看起来像那样，那么你告诉我一切都不好
given Z looks like that then you tell me everything is not okay

761
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,810
我的意思是我需要每学期写一次，所以给定Z时x的P
given Z looks like that then you tell me everything is not okay

762
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:30,820
我的意思是我需要每学期写一次，所以给定Z时x的P


763
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,490
我的意思是我需要每学期写一次，所以给定Z时x的P
I mean I'm going to need to compute write this every term so P of x given Z

764
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:35,500
我的意思是我需要每学期写一次，所以给定Z时x的P
write this every term so P of x given Z and V other parameters is given like

765
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,350
和V其他参数是这样给出的，所以我有n个数据点，我有一个
write this every term so P of x given Z and V other parameters is given like

766
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,780
和V其他参数是这样给出的，所以我有n个数据点，我有一个
and V other parameters is given like that so I have n data points I have a

767
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:39,790
和V其他参数是这样给出的，所以我有n个数据点，我有一个
that so I have n data points I have a mixed with K components so does this

768
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,820
与K成分混合在一起，这样才有意义，所以C和K采取什么-什么
that so I have n data points I have a mixed with K components so does this

769
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:51,090
与K成分混合在一起，这样才有意义，所以C和K采取什么-什么
mixed with K components so does this make sense so C and K takes what - what

770
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,100
与K成分混合在一起，这样才有意义，所以C和K采取什么-什么
make sense so C and K takes what - what is the one of the values in K takes Z so

771
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:57,890
是K中的值之一取Z，所以仅对每个数据点而言
make sense so C and K takes what - what is the one of the values in K takes Z so

772
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,080
是K中的值之一取Z，所以仅对每个数据点而言
is the one of the values in K takes Z so so for every data point right only

773
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,090
是K中的值之一取Z，所以仅对每个数据点而言
so for every data point right only assume this time see that product is

774
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,210
假设这次看到乘积将是高斯，那将是
so for every data point right only assume this time see that product is

775
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,080
假设这次看到乘积将是高斯，那将是
assume this time see that product is going to be a Gaussian and that would be

776
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,090
假设这次看到乘积将是高斯，那将是
going to be a Gaussian and that would be only for the K equals e and k equal to 1

777
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,550
仅当K等于e且k等于1时
going to be a Gaussian and that would be only for the K equals e and k equal to 1

778
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:13,560
仅当K等于e且k等于1时
only for the K equals e and k equal to 1 right

779
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,190
我们已经看到了大约一千次的面额，非常接近
only for the K equals e and k equal to 1 right

780
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,200
我们已经看到了大约一千次的面额，非常接近


781
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,420
我们已经看到了大约一千次的面额，非常接近
we have seen this about the thousand times of denominated so close to a very

782
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:21,430
我们已经看到了大约一千次的面额，非常接近
times of denominated so close to a very compact way of writing things everyone

783
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,540
每个人都可以的紧凑写作方式，您知道的我们最多
times of denominated so close to a very compact way of writing things everyone

784
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:33,330
每个人都可以的紧凑写作方式，您知道的我们最多
compact way of writing things everyone is in okay you know the most we listen

785
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:33,340
每个人都可以的紧凑写作方式，您知道的我们最多
is in okay you know the most we listen this tapes from home because they have

786
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,770
这是家中的磁带，因为他们无事可做，才是真正的爱
is in okay you know the most we listen this tapes from home because they have

00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,450
这是家中的磁带，因为他们无事可做，才是真正的爱
this tapes from home because they have nothing else to do right is true love

788
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:36,460
这是家中的磁带，因为他们无事可做，才是真正的爱
nothing else to do right is true love maybe scream once or say something

789
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,030
也许尖叫一次或说些什么，所以他们认为我不是在和一个
nothing else to do right is true love maybe scream once or say something

790
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,010
也许尖叫一次或说些什么，所以他们认为我不是在和一个
maybe scream once or say something so they think that I'm not talking to a

791
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,020
也许尖叫一次或说些什么，所以他们认为我不是在和一个
so they think that I'm not talking to a wall alright because you know lots of

792
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:46,500
好吧，因为你知道很多教授喜欢自言自语
so they think that I'm not talking to a wall alright because you know lots of

793
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,320
好吧，因为你知道很多教授喜欢自言自语
wall alright because you know lots of professors like talking to themselves

794
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:49,330
好吧，因为你知道很多教授喜欢自言自语
professors like talking to themselves alright so okay I can even pass you the

795
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,950
好吧，好吧，我什至可以把麦克风传给你，所以Z很奇怪，记得如此
professors like talking to themselves alright so okay I can even pass you the

796
00:28:52,950 --> 00:29:07,770
好吧，好吧，我什至可以把麦克风传给你，所以Z很奇怪，记得如此
alright so okay I can even pass you the microphone so weird so Z and remember so

00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:07,780
好吧，好吧，我什至可以把麦克风传给你，所以Z很奇怪，记得如此
microphone so weird so Z and remember so you know we are thinking about the next

798
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,960
你知道我们正在考虑下一个有人发现这种混合
microphone so weird so Z and remember so you know we are thinking about the next

你知道我们正在考虑下一个有人发现这种混合
another somebody find this mixing quotation spy and I want you to look at

801
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,100
报价间谍，我想让你看看这个，对我来说，我要么
another somebody find this mixing quotation spy and I want you to look at

802
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:21,840
报价间谍，我想让你看看这个，对我来说，我要么
quotation spy and I want you to look at this and to me it's okay that I'm either

803
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:21,850
报价间谍，我想让你看看这个，对我来说，我要么
this and to me it's okay that I'm either way we have it here remember every point

804
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:27,270
我们在这里拥有它的方式记住每个点xn3 Seussian，所以这是什么
this and to me it's okay that I'm either way we have it here remember every point

805
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:31,860
我们在这里拥有它的方式记住每个点xn3 Seussian，所以这是什么
way we have it here remember every point xn3 Seussian so so what is this here the

806
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:31,870
我们在这里拥有它的方式记住每个点xn3 Seussian，所以这是什么
xn3 Seussian so so what is this here the player that I am using is so over all

807
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,730
我正在使用的播放器是如此，所以在所有数据点上，我都会写什么
xn3 Seussian so so what is this here the player that I am using is so over all

808
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,460
我正在使用的播放器是如此，所以在所有数据点上，我都会写什么
player that I am using is so over all the data points I would write what is

809
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:38,470
我正在使用的播放器是如此，所以在所有数据点上，我都会写什么
the data points I would write what is this what is this conditional

810
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,220
这是给定PI的Z的条件分布是什么，所以它将
the data points I would write what is this what is this conditional

811
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:47,760
这是给定PI的Z的条件分布是什么，所以它将
this what is this conditional distribution of Z given PI so it would

812
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:47,770
这是给定PI的Z的条件分布是什么，所以它将
distribution of Z given PI so it would say at the given point and only one of

813
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,550
在给定的时间点说，并且只有其中一种情况是其中一种
distribution of Z given PI so it would say at the given point and only one of

833
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:36,950
cozinha上的参数要记住表示法还可以，您可能会说为什么
of the notation okay and you may say why did the clip prior because based is

834
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,650
事先做了剪辑，因为基于将使所有后代成为
of the notation okay and you may say why did the clip prior because based is

835
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,310
事先做了剪辑，因为基于将使所有后代成为
did the clip prior because based is going to make all the posteriors to be

836
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:41,320
事先做了剪辑，因为基于将使所有后代成为
going to make all the posteriors to be nothing else but updates basically the

837
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,980
只是更新了您所分配的分布参数而已
going to make all the posteriors to be nothing else but updates basically the

00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,570
只是更新了您所分配的分布参数而已
nothing else but updates basically the parameters of the distributions that you

839
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:46,580
只是更新了您所分配的分布参数而已
parameters of the distributions that you see right now so basically these are

840
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,500
现在看，所以基本上这些是共轭先验好，所以他们要去
parameters of the distributions that you see right now so basically these are

841
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,240
现在看，所以基本上这些是共轭先验好，所以他们要去
see right now so basically these are conjugate priors okay so they are going

842
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,250
现在看，所以基本上这些是共轭先验好，所以他们要去
conjugate priors okay so they are going to make the algebra easy okay the

843
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:59,500
为了使代数变得容易，参数的意思是亚特兰大，你可能有
conjugate priors okay so they are going to make the algebra easy okay the

844
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,920
为了使代数变得容易，参数的意思是亚特兰大，你可能有

00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:02,930
为了使代数变得容易，参数的意思是亚特兰大，你可能有
parameters mean atlanta and you may have seen this for evaluation you may not

846
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:07,780
看过这个用于评估，您可能还没有看过，所以基本上我们写这个
parameters mean atlanta and you may have seen this for evaluation you may not

847
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,440
看过这个用于评估，您可能还没有看过，所以基本上我们写这个
seen this for evaluation you may not have seen it so basically we write this

848
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:10,450
看过这个用于评估，您可能还没有看过，所以基本上我们写这个
have seen it so basically we write this as a product over all the components of

849
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,260
作为产品的不足，所有缺陷的所有组成部分
have seen it so basically we write this as a product over all the components of

what should I become below the regression problem what was the point of

868
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:48,980
在回归问题下我应该成为什么？
regression problem what was the point of the precision he was a memo said the

869
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:54,340
巫师先生说，他是备忘录的精确度。以任务为基础

874
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:02,690
我对伽玛分布权的多元变量的概括
of the gamma distribution right I mean if you think you know the wizard

875
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,240
如果您认为自己知道向导分发是某种分发
of the gamma distribution right I mean if you think you know the wizard

876
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,039
如果您认为自己知道向导分发是某种分发
if you think you know the wizard distribution is sort of a distribution

877
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:06,049
如果您认为自己知道向导分发是某种分发
distribution is sort of a distribution although symmetric positive-definite

878
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,220
虽然对称正定矩阵可以很好的分布我

879
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:14,440
虽然对称正定矩阵可以很好的分布我
although symmetric positive-definite matrices okay very nice distribution I

880
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:14,450
虽然对称正定矩阵可以很好的分布我
matrices okay very nice distribution I me if you think distribution of a matrix

881
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,960
我，如果您认为矩阵的分布较少，那么对称
matrices okay very nice distribution I me if you think distribution of a matrix

882
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,629
我，如果您认为矩阵的分布较少，那么对称
me if you think distribution of a matrix is less and what about symmetric

883
00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:19,639
我，如果您认为矩阵的分布较少，那么对称
is less and what about symmetric positive matrices here is the Parthians

884
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:21,460
正矩阵在这里是Parthians lambda k好的，所以这再次没问题
is less and what about symmetric positive matrices here is the Parthians

885
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:26,710
正矩阵在这里是Parthians lambda k好的，所以这再次没问题
positive matrices here is the Parthians lambda k okay so this is again all right

886
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:26,720
正矩阵在这里是Parthians lambda k好的，所以这再次没问题
lambda k okay so this is again all right so when you have that mean and precision

887
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,440
因此，当您具有未知的均值和精度时，可以这样写：
lambda k okay so this is again all right so when you have that mean and precision

888
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,049
因此，当您具有未知的均值和精度时，可以这样写：
so when you have that mean and precision unknown okay you write like that if

889
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:32,059
因此，当您具有未知的均值和精度时，可以这样写：
unknown okay you write like that if actually he did not use the precision

890
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:33,850
实际上，他没有使用精度，而是使用方差，这可以
unknown okay you write like that if actually he did not use the precision

891
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,039
实际上，他没有使用精度，而是使用方差，这可以
actually he did not use the precision but use the variance this can you can

892
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:36,049
实际上，他没有使用精度，而是使用方差，这可以
but use the variance this can you can write the same thing but instead of a

893
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:37,840
写同样的东西，但是代替了向导分发，而是放了英文
but use the variance this can you can write the same thing but instead of a

894
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,360
写同样的东西，但是代替了向导分发，而是放了英文
write the same thing but instead of a wizard distribution you put an English

895
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:40,370
写同样的东西，但是代替了向导分发，而是放了英文
wizard distribution you put an English wizard distribution

896
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,680
向导分发还可以，所以您可以使用所用的东西进行操作
wizard distribution you put an English wizard distribution

897
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,450
向导分发还可以，所以您可以使用所用的东西进行操作

898
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:46,460
向导分发还可以，所以您可以使用所用的东西进行操作
okay so what you use you can manipulate you one way or another but using here

899
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,570
您以一种或另一种方式使用，但是使用此处的精确度使代数方式是您

00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,019
可能吧，所以当其中之一时，我们将扩展所有这些
Jaime Lanka of the log of the joint of likelihood right okay so when one of

974
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:25,170
可能吧，所以当其中之一时，我们将扩展所有这些
likelihood right okay so when one of these we're going to expand this all

975
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:25,180
可能吧，所以当其中之一时，我们将扩展所有这些
these we're going to expand this all right and keep on in the terms the

976
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,970
正确并继续保持依存关系，让我们看看是什么类型
these we're going to expand this all right and keep on in the terms the

977
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:29,160
正确并继续保持依存关系，让我们看看是什么类型
right and keep on in the terms the dependency all right let's see what type

978
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,170
正确并继续保持依存关系，让我们看看是什么类型
dependency all right let's see what type of distribution it comes out so the only

979
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,859
分布的结果，所以唯一依赖于Z的时间就是这样
dependency all right let's see what type of distribution it comes out so the only

980
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,870
分布的结果，所以唯一依赖于Z的时间就是这样
of distribution it comes out so the only times that depend on Z is from this

981
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:33,880
分布的结果，所以唯一依赖于Z的时间就是这样
times that depend on Z is from this condition of Z given the mixing

982
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,430
给定混合系数，Z的条件，这可能是Patel可以
times that depend on Z is from this condition of Z given the mixing

983
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:40,049
给定混合系数，Z的条件，这可能是Patel可以
condition of Z given the mixing coefficients and this likely Patel okay

984
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:40,059
给定混合系数，Z的条件，这可能是Patel可以
coefficients and this likely Patel okay this depends on a and PI so these

985
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:41,849
这取决于a和PI，因此这些期望值受到尊重
coefficients and this likely Patel okay this depends on a and PI so these

986
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:44,370
这取决于a和PI，因此这些期望值受到尊重
this depends on a and PI so these expectations with respected by which

987
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:44,380
这取决于a和PI，因此这些期望值受到尊重
expectations with respected by which depends on in Atlanta so the expectation

988
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,180
取决于亚特兰大，所以期望是对亚特兰大的尊重
expectations with respected by which depends on in Atlanta so the expectation

989
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,109
取决于亚特兰大，所以期望是对亚特兰大的尊重
depends on in Atlanta so the expectation is with respect in the Atlanta possible

990
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:52,119
取决于亚特兰大，所以期望是对亚特兰大的尊重
is with respect in the Atlanta possible never share okay

991
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,260
永远都不会同意，我以前一直坚持要你的原因
is with respect in the Atlanta possible never share okay

992
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:58,490
永远都不会同意，我以前一直坚持要你的原因
never share okay and the reason I used to insist that you

993
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:58,500
永远都不会同意，我以前一直坚持要你的原因
and the reason I used to insist that you guys type this things in your homework

994
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,890
当你的时间很明显的时候，伙计们在你的家庭作业中输入这些东西
and the reason I used to insist that you guys type this things in your homework

995
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,940
当你的时间很明显的时候，伙计们在你的家庭作业中输入这些东西
guys type this things in your homework when your time the answers obvious if

996
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:04,950
当你的时间很明显的时候，伙计们在你的家庭作业中输入这些东西
when your time the answers obvious if you do this by chance you you never gave

997
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,750
您是偶然地做到这一点的，您从未选择让它起作用的选项，
when your time the answers obvious if you do this by chance you you never gave

998
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,200
您是偶然地做到这一点的，您从未选择让它起作用的选项，
you do this by chance you you never gave option to make this to work you have a

999
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,210
您是偶然地做到这一点的，您从未选择让它起作用的选项，
option to make this to work you have a complete mess so if you take P of Z

1000
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,000
完全是一团糟，所以如果您给定Z的给定值P等于Z
option to make this to work you have a complete mess so if you take P of Z

1001
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,030
完全是一团糟，所以如果您给定Z的给定值P等于Z
complete mess so if you take P of Z given pile given like this you take the

1002
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,040
完全是一团糟，所以如果您给定Z的给定值P等于Z
given pile given like this you take the likelihood you know like all this have

1003
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,590
您可能知道所有这些都有以前的公式，所以您记得
given pile given like this you take the likelihood you know like all this have

1004
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,680
您可能知道所有这些都有以前的公式，所以您记得
likelihood you know like all this have the previous formulas so you remember

1005
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:21,690
您可能知道所有这些都有以前的公式，所以您记得
the previous formulas so you remember you will take it next year so it will be

1006
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,300
您将在明年使用它，因此它将是PI的0倍，然后是
the previous formulas so you remember you will take it next year so it will be

1007
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,630
您将在明年使用它，因此它将是PI的0倍，然后是
you will take it next year so it will be 0 times R over PI and then will be an

1008
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:26,640
您将在明年使用它，因此它将是PI的0倍，然后是
0 times R over PI and then will be an expectation with respect to PI and here

1009
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,310
关于PI的期望值，这里我们将Z乘以
0 times R over PI and then will be an expectation with respect to PI and here

1010
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:34,190
关于PI的期望值，这里我们将Z乘以
expectation with respect to PI and here we're going to have Z times the end of

1011
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:34,200
关于PI的期望值，这里我们将Z乘以
we're going to have Z times the end of this with sigasi so obviously it going

1012
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,770
与sigasi一起使用，因此很明显它会给Z或抛出相同的东西，
we're going to have Z times the end of this with sigasi so obviously it going

1013
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,950
与sigasi一起使用，因此很明显它会给Z或抛出相同的东西，
this with sigasi so obviously it going to give Z or throw the same thing and

1014
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:38,960
与sigasi一起使用，因此很明显它会给Z或抛出相同的东西，
to give Z or throw the same thing and that same thing is what you see here all

1015
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,330
那件事就是你在这里看到的，好吧，这件事，这件事来自
to give Z or throw the same thing and that same thing is what you see here all

1016
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,720
那件事就是你在这里看到的，好吧，这件事，这件事来自
that same thing is what you see here all right this comes this thing comes from

1017
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:47,730
那件事就是你在这里看到的，好吧，这件事，这件事来自
right this comes this thing comes from here and all of the stones come from

1018
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,730
在这里，所有的石头都来自这个家伙的地方，你可以看到它吗
right this comes this thing comes from here and all of the stones come from

00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:55,340
在这里，所有的石头都来自这个家伙的地方，你可以看到它吗
where from this guy's you can you see it yes ok so this time wasted for

1021
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:01,640
是的，好的，所以这次浪费了记忆因素，我们不在乎
where from this guy's you can you see it yes ok so this time wasted for

1022
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,370
是的，好的，所以这次浪费了记忆因素，我们不在乎
yes ok so this time wasted for memorization factor we don't really care

1023
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:04,380
是的，好的，所以这次浪费了记忆因素，我们不在乎
memorization factor we don't really care about the cost of the time and okay and

1024
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,170
关于时间的花费，还可以，而且他们花钱跳舞，因为现在

when you do this graphs they look wonderful

1086
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,849
很棒，在文学中，人们就是这样
wonderful and in the literature that's how people

1087
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:44,859
很棒，在文学中，人们就是这样
and in the literature that's how people demonstrate the Costera supposed to be

1088
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:47,160
演示一下如果您还可以的话，Costera应该是现在，但是这些是

1093
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:00,960
帖子不负责任，好，我们讨论这个问题时，
okay and we have discussed this when we were talking about expectation

1094
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,180
在谈论期望最大化时，我们进行了讲座和
okay and we have discussed this when we were talking about expectation

1095
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,890
在谈论期望最大化时，我们进行了讲座和
were talking about expectation maximization we spent lectures and

1096
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:03,900
在谈论期望最大化时，我们进行了讲座和
maximization we spent lectures and lectures on this because this is

1097
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,480
关于这方面的讲座，因为这是
maximization we spent lectures and lectures on this because this is

1098
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:08,830
Z和K的宝贵基本期望是我们的NK，您还记得，因为
maximization we spent lectures and lectures on this because this is

1099
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:08,840
Z和K的宝贵基本期望是我们的NK，您还记得，因为


1100
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:15,830
Z和K的宝贵基本期望是我们的NK，您还记得，因为
valuable basically expectation of Z and K is our NK you remember that because

1101
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:15,840
Z和K的宝贵基本期望是我们的NK，您还记得，因为
K is our NK you remember that because you can only take values 0 and 1 right

1102
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,690
您只能正确取值0和1，因此期望值等于
K is our NK you remember that because you can only take values 0 and 1 right

1103
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,370
您只能正确取值0和1，因此期望值等于
you can only take values 0 and 1 right so the expectation is equal to the

1104
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:19,380
您只能正确取值0和1，因此期望值等于
so the expectation is equal to the probability that's the posterior

1105
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,380
这就是后验概率，即R和K直到现在
so the expectation is equal to the probability that's the posterior

1106
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,030
这就是后验概率，即R和K直到现在
probability that's the posterior probability which is R and K now up to

1107
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:26,040
这就是后验概率，即R和K直到现在
probability which is R and K now up to now is right that we have a nice job for

1108
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,940
现在是正确的，我们为此做得很好，但是此R的此设置取决于
probability which is R and K now up to now is right that we have a nice job for

1109
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,740
现在是正确的，我们为此做得很好，但是此R的此设置取决于
now is right that we have a nice job for this but this setting for this R depends

1110
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:33,750
现在是正确的，我们为此做得很好，但是此R的此设置取决于
this but this setting for this R depends on many expectations with respect to the

1111
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,690
对其他分布有很多期望，所以请注意我们可以
this but this setting for this R depends on many expectations with respect to the

1112
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,030
对其他分布有很多期望，所以请注意我们可以
on many expectations with respect to the other distributions so notice we can

1113
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,040
对其他分布有很多期望，所以请注意我们可以
other distributions so notice we can actually complete all of this we are

1114
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,440
实际上完成了所有这些工作，我们要下班了，我的意思是很高兴地说
other distributions so notice we can actually complete all of this we are

1115
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,290
实际上完成了所有这些工作，我们要下班了，我的意思是很高兴地说
actually complete all of this we are going off work I mean it's nice to say

1116
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:42,300
实际上完成了所有这些工作，我们要下班了，我的意思是很高兴地说
going off work I mean it's nice to say this is what it is but how do you

1117
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,600
就是这样，但是您如何计算侧倾，所以我们将继续
going off work I mean it's nice to say this is what it is but how do you

1118
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,100
就是这样，但是您如何计算侧倾，所以我们将继续
this is what it is but how do you compute a roll and and so we will keep

1119
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:49,110
就是这样，但是您如何计算侧倾，所以我们将继续
compute a roll and and so we will keep going and see how about I think we have

1120
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:58,430
去看看怎么样，当我们讨论关于
compute a roll and and so we will keep going and see how about I think we have

1121
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,960
去看看怎么样，当我们讨论关于
going and see how about I think we have seen them when we discuss about

1122
00:40:59,960 --> 00:40:59,970
去看看怎么样，当我们讨论关于
seen them when we discuss about expectation maximization so this is the

1123
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:05,740
期望最大化，所以这是垃圾中的要点，随身携带
seen them when we discuss about expectation maximization so this is the

1124
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:12,200
期望最大化，所以这是垃圾中的要点，随身携带
expectation maximization so this is the point in the garbage and carry all right

1125
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:12,210
期望最大化，所以这是垃圾中的要点，随身携带
point in the garbage and carry all right so basically whatever the points when

1126
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,420
因此，基本上，无论您总结这个神秘的看跌期权的要点如何
point in the garbage and carry all right so basically whatever the points when

1127
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,640
因此，基本上，无论您总结这个神秘的看跌期权的要点如何
so basically whatever the points when you sum this mysterious puts benefits

1128
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:16,650
因此，基本上，无论您总结这个神秘的看跌期权的要点如何
you sum this mysterious puts benefits now this is the effective sample name on

1129
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,310
现在这是高斯K上的有效样本名称
you sum this mysterious puts benefits now this is the effective sample name on

1130
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,090
现在这是高斯K上的有效样本名称
now this is the effective sample name on the Gaussian K all right so you take on

1131
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:23,100
现在这是高斯K上的有效样本名称
the Gaussian K all right so you take on the exist you want to apply them with

1132
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,010
您想将它们应用于后验可能性，这是
the Gaussian K all right so you take on the exist you want to apply them with

1133
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,390
您想将它们应用于后验可能性，这是
the exist you want to apply them with the posterior possibilities and this is

1134
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:26,400
您想将它们应用于后验可能性，这是
the posterior possibilities and this is the effective area okay so basically I

1135
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,240
有效区域好吧，所以基本上我在定义这个，因为如果你有
the posterior possibilities and this is the effective area okay so basically I

1136
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,700
有效区域好吧，所以基本上我在定义这个，因为如果你有
the effective area okay so basically I am defining this because if you have

1137
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:31,710
有效区域好吧，所以基本上我在定义这个，因为如果你有
am defining this because if you have these definitions you will see that the

1138
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,680
这些定义，您将看到代数将被简化，并且一个
am defining this because if you have these definitions you will see that the

1139
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,230
这些定义，您将看到代数将被简化，并且一个
these definitions you will see that the algebra is going to simplify and one

1140
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:36,240
这些定义，您将看到代数将被简化，并且一个
algebra is going to simplify and one identity that you may want to pay

1141
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,800
您可能要注意的身份，因为这些条款不能
algebra is going to simplify and one identity that you may want to pay

1142
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,960
您可能要注意的身份，因为这些条款不能
identity that you may want to pay attention because the terms can be not

1143
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:41,970
您可能要注意的身份，因为这些条款不能
attention because the terms can be not just on this setting but in many related

1144
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:44,690
只是在此设置上，但在许多相关设置中将具有这些
attention because the terms can be not just on this setting but in many related

1145
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,710
只是在此设置上，但在许多相关设置中将具有这些
just on this setting but in many related settings will have these

1146
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:45,720
只是在此设置上，但在许多相关设置中将具有这些
settings will have these responsibilities it is very nice

1147
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,770
责任是一个很好的身份，基本上直接来自
settings will have these responsibilities it is very nice

1148
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,650
责任是一个很好的身份，基本上直接来自
responsibilities it is very nice identity that comes directly basically

1149
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:51,660
责任是一个很好的身份，基本上直接来自
identity that comes directly basically by taking the definition of SK and

1150
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,270
通过采用SK的定义并将其扩展为可以
identity that comes directly basically by taking the definition of SK and

1151
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,800
通过采用SK的定义并将其扩展为可以
by taking the definition of SK and expanding it okay

1152
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:54,810
通过采用SK的定义并将其扩展为可以
expanding it okay so somewhere in the derivations we've

1153
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:57,800
所以在推导中的某个地方，我们今天没有说过，但是当我们阅读
expanding it okay so somewhere in the derivations we've

1154
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,960
所以在推导中的某个地方，我们今天没有说过，但是当我们阅读
so somewhere in the derivations we've not said today but when we read the

1155
00:41:59,960 --> 00:41:59,970
所以在推导中的某个地方，我们今天没有说过，但是当我们阅读
not said today but when we read the notes

1156
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:00,880
注意这是一个计算或概念，所以
not said today but when we read the notes

1157
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,040
注意这是一个计算或概念，所以
notes this is a calculation or concept okay so

1158
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,050
注意这是一个计算或概念，所以
this is a calculation or concept okay so we want to calculate Q up by mu and

1159
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,620
我们想通过mu和lambda来计算Q，所以这就是那个的爱
this is a calculation or concept okay so we want to calculate Q up by mu and

1160
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:13,500
我们想通过mu和lambda来计算Q，所以这就是那个的爱
we want to calculate Q up by mu and lambda so this would be the love of that

1161
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:13,510
我们想通过mu和lambda来计算Q，所以这就是那个的爱
lambda so this would be the love of that advocate pioneer lanta will be the

1162
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:16,570
倡导者开拓者兰塔将是对原木Z的期望
lambda so this would be the love of that advocate pioneer lanta will be the

1163
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,450
倡导者开拓者兰塔将是对原木Z的期望
advocate pioneer lanta will be the expectation with respect to Z of the log

1164
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:19,460
倡导者开拓者兰塔将是对原木Z的期望
expectation with respect to Z of the log of the join the likelihood with the only

1165
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,830
我们唯一要保持的加入可能性是
expectation with respect to Z of the log of the join the likelihood with the only

1166
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,180
我们唯一要保持的加入可能性是
of the join the likelihood with the only times we're going to be keeping is

1167
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:25,190
我们唯一要保持的加入可能性是
times we're going to be keeping is anything that depends on P near Atlanta

1168
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,640
在亚特兰大附近依赖P的任何东西，在那个时候
times we're going to be keeping is anything that depends on P near Atlanta

1169
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,530
在亚特兰大附近依赖P的任何东西，在那个时候
anything that depends on P near Atlanta and in those times anything that

1170
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:29,540
在亚特兰大附近依赖P的任何东西，在那个时候
and in those times anything that contains it will take expectations so

1171
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,410
包含期望，所以基本上你会从中得到
and in those times anything that contains it will take expectations so

1172
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:37,240
包含期望，所以基本上你会从中得到
contains it will take expectations so basically what you get is you get from

1173
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:37,250
包含期望，所以基本上你会从中得到
basically what you get is you get from the prior to get love of the prior from

1174
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:41,320
从堆中获得先验的先验记得我们有一个联合
basically what you get is you get from the prior to get love of the prior from

1175
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,840
从堆中获得先验的先验记得我们有一个联合
the prior to get love of the prior from the pile remember we had a joint

1176
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:43,850
从堆中获得先验的先验记得我们有一个联合
the pile remember we had a joint distribution of in Atlanta but Gaussian

1177
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:47,200
在亚特兰大的分布，但高斯向导的分布有一个0取决于
the pile remember we had a joint distribution of in Atlanta but Gaussian

1178
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,750
在亚特兰大的分布，但高斯向导的分布有一个0取决于
distribution of in Atlanta but Gaussian wizard distribution there is a 0 depends

1179
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:52,760
在亚特兰大的分布，但高斯向导的分布有一个0取决于
wizard distribution there is a 0 depends on PI so we can have an expectation this

1180
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,380
在PI上，所以我们可以期望在此时间内有这个Z记住我们有
wizard distribution there is a 0 depends on PI so we can have an expectation this

1181
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,070
在PI上，所以我们可以期望在此时间内有这个Z记住我们有
on PI so we can have an expectation this Z here inside the time remember we have

1182
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:00,080
在PI上，所以我们可以期望在此时间内有这个Z记住我们有
Z here inside the time remember we have the Gaussian to the powers east of the

1183
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,620
信号以东的高斯下降了，所以我们有一个
Z here inside the time remember we have the Gaussian to the powers east of the

1184
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,090
信号以东的高斯下降了，所以我们有一个
the Gaussian to the powers east of the signal comes down so we have an

1185
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:04,100
信号以东的高斯下降了，所以我们有一个
signal comes down so we have an expectation times the log of the

1186
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,530
期望乘以高斯对数加上常数就可以了，
signal comes down so we have an expectation times the log of the

1187
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:08,790
期望乘以高斯对数加上常数就可以了，
expectation times the log of the Gaussian plus constants okay and

1188
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:08,800
期望乘以高斯对数加上常数就可以了，
Gaussian plus constants okay and interestingly enough right when you look

1189
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,410
有趣的是，当您查看此分布时，就好了
Gaussian plus constants okay and interestingly enough right when you look

1190
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:14,800
有趣的是，当您查看此分布时，就好了
interestingly enough right when you look at this distribution okay my thing just

1191
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:14,810
有趣的是，当您查看此分布时，就好了
at this distribution okay my thing just died okay alright so when you look on on

1192
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:21,510
死了好吧，好吧，所以当你继续观察别人与你在一起时，
at this distribution okay my thing just died okay alright so when you look on on

1193
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:27,130
死了好吧，好吧，所以当你继续观察别人与你在一起时，
died okay alright so when you look on on the does anybody else with you that's a

1194
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:27,140
死了好吧，好吧，所以当你继续观察别人与你在一起时，
the does anybody else with you that's a very stupid question right it's like

1195
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,260
非常愚蠢的问题，就像问您是否有整个森林
the does anybody else with you that's a very stupid question right it's like

1196
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,650
非常愚蠢的问题，就像问您是否有整个森林
very stupid question right it's like asking if you have any an entire forest

1197
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:32,660
非常愚蠢的问题，就像问您是否有整个森林
asking if you have any an entire forest walking right something like that okay

1198
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:36,040
像这样走路就可以了，所以你没有电池怎么办
asking if you have any an entire forest walking right something like that okay

1199
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,530
像这样走路就可以了，所以你没有电池怎么办
walking right something like that okay so you have no batteries how can you

1200
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:38,540
像这样走路就可以了，所以你没有电池怎么办
so you have no batteries how can you leave home without batteries that's

1201
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,820
没有电池就离开家，这是不可接受的
so you have no batteries how can you leave home without batteries that's

1202
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,570
没有电池就离开家，这是不可接受的
leave home without batteries that's unacceptable

1203
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:40,580
没有电池就离开家，这是不可接受的
unacceptable okay so you can circle the equation they

1204
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:46,300
好吧，你可以圈出等式，它们是正确的，但肯定超过K的权利
unacceptable okay so you can circle the equation they

1205
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:55,300
好吧，你可以圈出等式，它们是正确的，但肯定超过K的权利
okay so you can circle the equation they are right but the certainly over K right

1206
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:55,310
好吧，你可以圈出等式，它们是正确的，但肯定超过K的权利
are right but the certainly over K right because you can see the two summations

1207
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,550
因为你可以看到凯利的两个总结，当你
are right but the certainly over K right because you can see the two summations

1208
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,010
因为你可以看到凯利的两个总结，当你
because you can see the two summations from Kelly and we have no joy when you

1209
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:00,020
因为你可以看到凯利的两个总结，当你
from Kelly and we have no joy when you get rid of the log basically you get the

1210
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,960
摆脱日志，基本上可以得到K的因式分解，所以29
from Kelly and we have no joy when you get rid of the log basically you get the

1211
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,380
摆脱日志，基本上可以得到K的因式分解，所以29
get rid of the log basically you get the factorization over K so 29

1212
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:04,390
摆脱日志，基本上可以得到K的因式分解，所以29
factorization over K so 29 okay so so tsunamis I'm gonna put in the

1213
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:10,970
好吧，所以我要把海啸放到
factorization over K so 29 okay so so tsunamis I'm gonna put in the

1214
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:16,529
好吧，所以我要把海啸放到
okay so so tsunamis I'm gonna put in the the probably shall we have the condition

1215
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:16,539

the algebra but there are some tricky things that come all the time

1254
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:25,559
代数，但总有一些棘手的事情
things that come all the time so if I notice them I need to tell you

1255
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:28,010
所以如果我注意到他们，我需要告诉你发生了什么，所以基本上我们开始
things that come all the time so if I notice them I need to tell you

1256
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:29,809
所以如果我注意到他们，我需要告诉你发生了什么，所以基本上我们开始
so if I notice them I need to tell you what's going on so basically we start

1257
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:29,819
所以如果我注意到他们，我需要告诉你发生了什么，所以基本上我们开始
what's going on so basically we start killed in this expectation of respect to

1258
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:34,370
在对零的期望中被杀死，可能性还可以，并且
what's going on so basically we start killed in this expectation of respect to

1259
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:39,619
在对零的期望中被杀死，可能性还可以，并且
killed in this expectation of respect to zero the joint of likelihood okay and

1263
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:53,670
以某种精确度进行超额结余决策，然后以某种方式带来
precision that then comes with some way start so you don't have to take the one

1264
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,390
开始，所以您不必进行一项服务，您可能会说平常的话
precision that then comes with some way start so you don't have to take the one

00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,000
开始，所以您不必进行一项服务，您可能会说平常的话
start so you don't have to take the one service and you may say well the usual

1266
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,010
开始，所以您不必进行一项服务，您可能会说平常的话
service and you may say well the usual distribution of a distribution or posted

因为这个角色正确而要做，所以你必须这样做，这样你就可以做到
do it because of this character right you have to do this so you take most

1272
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:08,670
因为这个角色正确而要做，所以你必须这样做，这样你就可以做到
you have to do this so you take most launched etc etc and and you get

1273
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:14,359
推出等等等等，基本上您会看到
you have to do this so you take most launched etc etc and and you get

1274
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:15,950
推出等等等等，基本上您会看到
launched etc etc and and you get basically you look at the terms that

1275
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:15,960
推出等等等等，基本上您会看到
basically you look at the terms that they were warning me

1276
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,859
他们警告我兰塔，他看着最佳
basically you look at the terms that they were warning me

1277
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:19,259
他们警告我兰塔，他看着最佳
they were warning me Lanta and he looked at the optimal

1278
00:47:19,259 --> 00:47:19,269
他们警告我兰塔，他看着最佳
Lanta and he looked at the optimal distribution so out of this you can

1279
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,900
分布，因此您可以提取伦敦的音素，您可以看到
Lanta and he looked at the optimal distribution so out of this you can

1280
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,700
分布，因此您可以提取伦敦的音素，您可以看到
distribution so out of this you can extract phoneme in London you can see

1281
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:23,710
分布，因此您可以提取伦敦的音素，您可以看到
extract phoneme in London you can see lower to start up in Atlanta is

1282
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:26,190
较低的亚特兰大开始基本上是这两条线好了
extract phoneme in London you can see lower to start up in Atlanta is

1283
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:31,259
较低的亚特兰大开始基本上是这两条线好了
lower to start up in Atlanta is basically this two lines here alright

1284
00:47:31,259 --> 00:47:34,009
令人惊讶的好吧，所以这是
lower to start up in Atlanta is basically this two lines here alright

1285
00:47:34,009 --> 00:47:34,019
令人惊讶的好吧，所以这是


1286
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:45,089
令人惊讶的好吧，所以这是
surprising okay alright so this is the

1287
00:47:45,089 --> 00:47:56,420
好吧，例如好吧，如果你用这个表达式
surprising okay alright so this is the

1288
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:56,430
好吧，例如好吧，如果你用这个表达式


1289
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:25,890
好吧，例如好吧，如果你用这个表达式
okay for example okay and if you with in this expression

1290
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:25,900
好吧，例如好吧，如果你用这个表达式
okay and if you with in this expression you basically get a Gaussian in new all

1291
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,210
您基本上会得到一个新的高斯函数，如果您将它放在
okay and if you with in this expression you basically get a Gaussian in new all

1292
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,650
您基本上会得到一个新的高斯函数，如果您将它放在
you basically get a Gaussian in new all right you can see it if you place the

1293
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:31,660
您基本上会得到一个新的高斯函数，如果您将它放在
right you can see it if you place the square and that's the mastership

1294
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,910
广场，那是大师的权利，所以如果您和
right you can see it if you place the square and that's the mastership

1295
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:41,670
广场，那是大师的权利，所以如果您和
square and that's the mastership alright so from this again if you and

1296
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:41,680
广场，那是大师的权利，所以如果您和
alright so from this again if you and now how do you defend the posterior is

1297
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:50,339
现在，你如何捍卫后方是有条件的几次
alright so from this again if you and now how do you defend the posterior is

1298
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:54,299
现在，你如何捍卫后方是有条件的几次
now how do you defend the posterior is the conditional for several times the

1299
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:54,309
现在，你如何捍卫后方是有条件的几次
the conditional for several times the variation distribution of Ishita so if

1300
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:56,819
石田的变化分布，所以如果您采取行动，您实际上可以
the conditional for several times the variation distribution of Ishita so if

1301
00:48:56,819 --> 00:49:00,029
石田的变化分布，所以如果您采取行动，您实际上可以
variation distribution of Ishita so if you take an action that you can actually

1302
00:49:00,029 --> 00:49:00,039
石田的变化分布，所以如果您采取行动，您实际上可以
you take an action that you can actually compute the I'll keep going backwards if

1303
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:04,589
计算一下，如果您采用可以的功能，我将继续往前走
you take an action that you can actually compute the I'll keep going backwards if

1304
00:49:04,589 --> 00:49:06,329
计算一下，如果您采用可以的功能，我将继续往前走
compute the I'll keep going backwards if you take the function that you can

1305
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:06,339
计算一下，如果您采用可以的功能，我将继续往前走
you take the function that you can actually compute the approximation of

1306
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:10,950
实际计算lambda的后验的近似值，所以如果您这样做
you take the function that you can actually compute the approximation of

1307
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:14,099
实际计算lambda的后验的近似值，所以如果您这样做
actually compute the approximation of the posterior of lambda and so if you do

1308
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:14,109
实际计算lambda的后验的近似值，所以如果您这样做
the posterior of lambda and so if you do the algebra you get many different weird

1309
00:49:14,109 --> 00:49:16,470
代数，您会得到许多不同的怪异术语，如果您有耐心，并且
the posterior of lambda and so if you do the algebra you get many different weird

1310
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:22,210
代数，您会得到许多不同的怪异术语，如果您有耐心，并且
the algebra you get many different weird terms okay and if you have patience and

1311
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:22,220
代数，您会得到许多不同的怪异术语，如果您有耐心，并且
terms okay and if you have patience and you actually homophobe has disappear all

1312
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:25,870
你实际上同性恋已经消失了所有的东西抵消了，你得到他们的
terms okay and if you have patience and you actually homophobe has disappear all

1313
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,970
你实际上同性恋已经消失了所有的东西抵消了，你得到他们的
you actually homophobe has disappear all the things cancel out and you get their

1314
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:27,980
你实际上同性恋已经消失了所有的东西抵消了，你得到他们的
the things cancel out and you get their wonderful approximation for the love of

1315
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,610
对lambda k键的热爱，这是一个奇妙的近似值
the things cancel out and you get their wonderful approximation for the love of

1316
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,530
对lambda k键的热爱，这是一个奇妙的近似值
wonderful approximation for the love of the key of lambda k that looks like that

1317
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:32,540
对lambda k键的热爱，这是一个奇妙的近似值
the key of lambda k that looks like that okay well this wk inversed comes to be

1318
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:36,970
好吧，这周倒过来就是这个，你可能会认为这是一个
the key of lambda k that looks like that okay well this wk inversed comes to be

1319
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:40,030
好吧，这周倒过来就是这个，你可能会认为这是一个
okay well this wk inversed comes to be this which you may think it's a

1320
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:40,040
好吧，这周倒过来就是这个，你可能会认为这是一个
this which you may think it's a complicated expression okay and UK comes

1321
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,950
复杂的表达式好了，英国变成u 0加10 K，你知道我
this which you may think it's a complicated expression okay and UK comes

1322
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:47,590
复杂的表达式好了，英国变成u 0加10 K，你知道我
complicated expression okay and UK comes to be u 0 plus 10 K and you know that I

1323
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:47,600
复杂的表达式好了，英国变成u 0加10 K，你知道我
to be u 0 plus 10 K and you know that I prefer this is the relative distribution

1324
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,780
偏爱这是相对分布效应，所以当你看这个权利的时候
to be u 0 plus 10 K and you know that I prefer this is the relative distribution

1325
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:57,040
偏爱这是相对分布效应，所以当你看这个权利的时候
prefer this is the relative distribution effect so when you look at this right

1326
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,050
偏爱这是相对分布效应，所以当你看这个权利的时候
effect so when you look at this right you can still submit additional under K

1327
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:59,650
您仍然可以在K下提交其他内容，但这是什么类型的分布
effect so when you look at this right you can still submit additional under K

1328
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:04,830
您仍然可以在K下提交其他内容，但这是什么类型的分布
you can still submit additional under K but what type of distribution is this

1329
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:04,840
您仍然可以在K下提交其他内容，但这是什么类型的分布
but what type of distribution is this exponential you think I get so what you

1330
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:12,070
您认为我得到了指数，所以您得到了向导分发，这是
but what type of distribution is this exponential you think I get so what you

1331
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:14,050
您认为我得到了指数，所以您得到了向导分发，这是
exponential you think I get so what you gets a wizard distribution and here's

1332
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:14,060
您认为我得到了指数，所以您得到了向导分发，这是
gets a wizard distribution and here's the answer okay alright so the combined

1333
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:20,470
答案很好，所以组合的基本分布公式兰塔是
gets a wizard distribution and here's the answer okay alright so the combined

1334
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,900
答案很好，所以组合的基本分布公式兰塔是
the answer okay alright so the combined basically distribution formula lanta is

1335
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:22,910
答案很好，所以组合的基本分布公式兰塔是
basically distribution formula lanta is a Gaussian wizard okay so the Gaussian

1336
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:26,950
高斯向导还可以，因此高斯精度lambda随带
basically distribution formula lanta is a Gaussian wizard okay so the Gaussian

1337
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:29,380
高斯向导还可以，因此高斯精度lambda随带
a Gaussian wizard okay so the Gaussian the precision lambda comes with the

1338
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:29,390
高斯向导还可以，因此高斯精度lambda随带
the precision lambda comes with the wizard next to it and kill all the

1339
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:31,390
向导旁边，并有选择地杀死所有参数
the precision lambda comes with the wizard next to it and kill all the

1340
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:34,090
向导旁边，并有选择地杀死所有参数
wizard next to it and kill all the parameters selectively the approximation

1341
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:34,100
向导旁边，并有选择地杀死所有参数
parameters selectively the approximation to the posterior of new claim of decay

1342
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,910
到新的衰变要求的后部，与我们之前的先验是相同的12
parameters selectively the approximation to the posterior of new claim of decay

1343
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:41,200
到新的衰变要求的后部，与我们之前的先验是相同的12
to the posterior of new claim of decay it is the same 12 as the priors that we

1344
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:41,210
到新的衰变要求的后部，与我们之前的先验是相同的12
it is the same 12 as the priors that we use from your lambda

1345
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:42,460
使用lambda的唯一区别是参数
it is the same 12 as the priors that we use from your lambda

1346
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,590
使用lambda的唯一区别是参数
use from your lambda the only differences the parameters

1347
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:44,600
使用lambda的唯一区别是参数
the only differences the parameters because 0 and mu 0 etc or nu 0 w0 have

1348
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:51,610
因为0和mu 0 etc或nu 0 w0现在已经更新，所以有
the only differences the parameters because 0 and mu 0 etc or nu 0 w0 have

1349
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:54,460
因为0和mu 0 etc或nu 0 w0现在已经更新，所以有
because 0 and mu 0 etc or nu 0 w0 have been updated now and this have sort of

1350
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:54,470
因为0和mu 0 etc或nu 0 w0现在已经更新，所以有
been updated now and this have sort of the updates of the parameters so

1351
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:58,420
参数的更新，因此基本上使用共轭先验给出了
been updated now and this have sort of the updates of the parameters so

1352
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:02,950
参数的更新，因此基本上使用共轭先验给出了
the updates of the parameters so basically using conjugate priors gave a

1353
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:02,960
参数的更新，因此基本上使用共轭先验给出了
basically using conjugate priors gave a similar variation approximation that is

1354
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,500
相似的变化近似值，对于所有相同的事物来说都是相同的，所以这
basically using conjugate priors gave a similar variation approximation that is

1355
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,930
相似的变化近似值，对于所有相同的事物来说都是相同的，所以这
similar variation approximation that is the same identical for all right so this

1356
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:07,940
相似的变化近似值，对于所有相同的事物来说都是相同的，所以这
the same identical for all right so this is very nice

1357
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,480
是非常好的
the same identical for all right so this is very nice

mix equation and this is when you start alright so these are the prior makes

1559
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:26,920
好了，所以这些是先前的制造分区，但随着我们的进行，我们将继续
mix equation and this is when you start alright so these are the prior makes

1560
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,130

1564
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,010
这将是颜色，将基于后继职责
based on the posterior responsibilities so this is this is not okay this is

1565
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:42,670
所以这是不好的，这是迭代15好的，这是
based on the posterior responsibilities so this is this is not okay this is

1566
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:47,140
所以这是不好的，这是迭代15好的，这是
so this is this is not okay this is iteration 15 okay on this are the

1567
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:47,150
所以这是不好的，这是迭代15好的，这是
iteration 15 okay on this are the different Gaussian basically but you

1568
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:50,049
基本上是不同的高斯，但是您计算这种情况60
iteration 15 okay on this are the different Gaussian basically but you

1569
00:58:50,049 --> 00:58:54,370
基本上是不同的高斯，但是您计算这种情况60
different Gaussian basically but you compute this situation 60 and this

1570
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:54,380
基本上是不同的高斯，但是您计算这种情况60
compute this situation 60 and this situation 120 so basically the model

1571
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,940
情况120，所以从2000年开始模型基本上崩溃了，现在您知道了
compute this situation 60 and this situation 120 so basically the model

1576
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:03,930
碰巧你知道你说我混了
mixture collapse on on two gaussians well yeah

1577
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:06,920
对两个高斯人崩溃了，是的，因为我们使用过的这个球员
mixture collapse on on two gaussians well yeah

对两个高斯人崩溃了，是的，因为我们使用过的这个球员
collapse on on two gaussians well yeah because this players that we have used

1579
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:10,230
对两个高斯人崩溃了，是的，因为我们使用过的这个球员
because this players that we have used for you know they enforce with the

1580
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:17,210
因为您知道他们会用流行词强制执行，所以
because this players that we have used for you know they enforce with the

1581
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:20,360
因为您知道他们会用流行词强制执行，所以
for you know they enforce with the buzzword supposed to do okay so the

1582
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:20,370
因为您知道他们会用流行词强制执行，所以
buzzword supposed to do okay so the spires we use basically kills some of

1583
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,340
我们使用的尖刺基本上可以杀死某些组件
buzzword supposed to do okay so the spires we use basically kills some of

1584
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,650
我们使用的尖刺基本上可以杀死某些组件
spires we use basically kills some of the components okay

1585
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:24,660
我们使用的尖刺基本上可以杀死某些组件
the components okay and the misny that's why he gives the

1586
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,840
这就是为什么他对乳脂这个名字也给出了相同的想法的原因
the components okay and the misny that's why he gives the

1587
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,280
这就是为什么他对乳脂这个名字也给出了相同的想法的原因
and the misny that's why he gives the same ideas right for the name cream

1588
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:28,290
这就是为什么他对乳脂这个名字也给出了相同的想法的原因
same ideas right for the name cream actually remember I have and into a

1589
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:30,050
真的记得我有一个混在一起，所以你说一百你好1200
same ideas right for the name cream actually remember I have and into a

1590
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:34,910
真的记得我有一个混在一起，所以你说一百你好1200
actually remember I have and into a mixed so you say hundred you well 1200

1591
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:34,920
真的记得我有一个混在一起，所以你说一百你好1200
mixed so you say hundred you well 1200 would go down to five ten you know so

1592
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,280
会下降到五点十，你知道，所以在没有你的情况下会下降到120
mixed so you say hundred you well 1200 would go down to five ten you know so

1593
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,820
会下降到五点十，你知道，所以在没有你的情况下会下降到120
would go down to five ten you know so here it goes down to to 120 without you

1594
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:40,830
会下降到五点十，你知道，所以在没有你的情况下会下降到120
here it goes down to to 120 without you having to do so the city is Islam sort

1595
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:44,660
必须这样做，这座城市是伊斯兰教，而不是以某种暴力的方式说
here it goes down to to 120 without you having to do so the city is Islam sort

1596
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:49,610
必须这样做，这座城市是伊斯兰教，而不是以某种暴力的方式说
having to do so the city is Islam sort of not in in a sort of violent way say

1597
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:49,620
必须这样做，这座城市是伊斯兰教，而不是以某种暴力的方式说
of not in in a sort of violent way say use two components it's mostly the two

1598
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:52,760
使用两个组件，主要是两个组件都不会出现，因为
of not in in a sort of violent way say use two components it's mostly the two

1599
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,170
使用两个组件，主要是两个组件都不会出现，因为
use two components it's mostly the two components are not coming because the

1600
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:57,180
使用两个组件，主要是两个组件都不会出现，因为
components are not coming because the responsibilities taken for the data

1601
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:00,740
数据点承担的责任基本上为零
components are not coming because the responsibilities taken for the data

1602
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,570
数据点承担的责任基本上为零
responsibilities taken for the data points are basically zero alright

1603
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:02,580
数据点承担的责任基本上为零
points are basically zero alright there's zero these block okay this is

1604
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:12,110
这些块为零，好吧，这是
points are basically zero alright there's zero these block okay this is

1605
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:14,170
再一次幸存下来，您可以描述一下
points are basically zero alright there's zero these block okay this is

1606
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:14,180
再一次幸存下来，您可以描述一下


1607
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:23,390
再一次幸存下来，您可以描述一下
and again alright survives you to describe look at

1608
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:23,400
再一次幸存下来，您可以描述一下
alright survives you to describe look at this code right thing works okay so

1609
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:36,380
这段代码正确的事情很好，所以
alright survives you to describe look at this code right thing works okay so

1610
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,300
组件幸免于难，它花费了九十年代的大部分时间
alright survives you to describe look at this code right thing works okay so

1611
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:37,310
组件幸免于难，它花费了九十年代的大部分时间


1612
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:43,040
组件幸免于难，它花费了九十年代的大部分时间
component survived all right and it takes so much of it relations ninety

1613
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:43,050
组件幸免于难，它花费了九十年代的大部分时间
takes so much of it relations ninety iterations you notice this is the an in

1614
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:47,150
迭代，您会注意到这是一个相反的单调增加
takes so much of it relations ninety iterations you notice this is the an in

1615
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,220
迭代，您会注意到这是一个相反的单调增加
iterations you notice this is the an in opposite monotonically increases okay

1616
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:49,230
迭代，您会注意到这是一个相反的单调增加
opposite monotonically increases okay and this is this would work here

1617
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:58,400
这是这将在这里工作
opposite monotonically increases okay and this is this would work here

1618
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,410
所以这一次，如果您知道这种不同，基本上我认为这是
opposite monotonically increases okay and this is this would work here

1619
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:01,420
所以这一次，如果您知道这种不同，基本上我认为这是


1620
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:11,110
所以这一次，如果您知道这种不同，基本上我认为这是
so this time if you know of this different basically I supposed this

1621
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:11,120
所以这一次，如果您知道这种不同，基本上我认为这是
different basically I supposed this isn't the postilion values of alpha

1622
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,060
不是alpha电锯的postilion值
different basically I supposed this isn't the postilion values of alpha

1623
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:13,840
不是alpha电锯的postilion值
isn't the postilion values of alpha chainsaw

1624
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:13,850
不是alpha电锯的postilion值
chainsaw okay the Brazilian values of alpha K and

1625
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:16,720
好吧，alpha K的巴西值，您注意到最终您知道
chainsaw okay the Brazilian values of alpha K and

1626
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,620
好吧，alpha K的巴西值，您注意到最终您知道
okay the Brazilian values of alpha K and you notice eventually you know after

1627
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:20,630
好吧，alpha K的巴西值，您注意到最终您知道
you notice eventually you know after interation 94 so this is some

1628
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:22,330
交互94，所以这是之后的一些中间响应迭代
you notice eventually you know after interation 94 so this is some

1629
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:25,240
交互94，所以这是之后的一些中间响应迭代
interation 94 so this is some intermediate response iteration after

1630
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:25,250
交互94，所以这是之后的一些中间响应迭代
intermediate response iteration after iteration 912 only 2000 volunteers

1631
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:29,010
912次迭代只有2000名志愿者幸存下来，所以这实际上可能是
intermediate response iteration after iteration 912 only 2000 volunteers

1632
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:32,020
912次迭代只有2000名志愿者幸存下来，所以这实际上可能是
iteration 912 only 2000 volunteers survived okay so this actually may be

1633
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:32,030
912次迭代只有2000名志愿者幸存下来，所以这实际上可能是
survived okay so this actually may be the same data set as the one I saw you

1634
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:35,020
与我在几秒钟内用Python代码看到的数据集相同的数据集
survived okay so this actually may be the same data set as the one I saw you

1635
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:38,680
与我在几秒钟内用Python代码看到的数据集相同的数据集

1692
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,510
你知道，所以我要说的是这个国家，我要选择
values it's a it's a it's a you know so so I'm going it said this

1693
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:54,950
你知道，所以我要说的是这个国家，我要选择
you know so so I'm going it said this country which I'm going to pick the

1694
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:54,960
你知道，所以我要说的是这个国家，我要选择
country which I'm going to pick the Grantham Z alright okay okay

1777
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:53,750
答案栏实际上并不像我让它看起来正确时那样痛苦
painful as I make it to look like right so you will you need basically the

1778
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:59,020
所以您基本上需要该系数YK的期望值
painful as I make it to look like right so you will you need basically the

1779
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,060

1851
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:43,520
如果我们之前已经通过这些实验室和向导分发完成了它们
these labs and wizard distribution okay so very nice formula okay all right I

1852
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,140
很好的公式，好吧，我不知道为什么这么消极地讲好吧，所以
these labs and wizard distribution okay so very nice formula okay all right I

1853
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:49,690
很好的公式，好吧，我不知道为什么这么消极地讲好吧，所以
so very nice formula okay all right I don't know why so negative put okay so

1854
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:49,700
很好的公式，好吧，我不知道为什么这么消极地讲好吧，所以
don't know why so negative put okay so this is it's an approximation obviously

1855
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,450
这显然是预测的近似值
don't know why so negative put okay so this is it's an approximation obviously

1856
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:54,089
这显然是预测的近似值
this is it's an approximation obviously of the predicted

1857
01:10:54,089 --> 01:10:54,099
这显然是预测的近似值
of the predicted tribution it's an approximation because

1858
01:10:54,099 --> 01:10:55,950
贡献，这是一个近似值，因为我们使用的参数百分比为

01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:58,560
贡献，这是一个近似值，因为我们使用的参数百分比为
tribution it's an approximation because the percent of the parameters we use was

1860
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:58,570
贡献，这是一个近似值，因为我们使用的参数百分比为
the percent of the parameters we use was not the exact posterior it was the

1861
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:00,479
不是确切的后验，而是变化近似，所以这些
the percent of the parameters we use was not the exact posterior it was the

1862
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:03,990
不是确切的后验，而是变化近似，所以这些
not the exact posterior it was the variation approximation okay so these

1863
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:04,000
不是确切的后验，而是变化近似，所以这些
variation approximation okay so these exercises in in the notes so you're

1864
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,379
在笔记中进行练习，以便您对可以执行的操作感兴趣，并且
variation approximation okay so these exercises in in the notes so you're

1865

再次，这是一个非常好的练习，如果你看一下这个公式，让我
interested what you can do this and again it's a very nice exercise if you

1868
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:19,350
再次，这是一个非常好的练习，如果你看一下这个公式，让我
again it's a very nice exercise if you look at this formula and take let me

1869
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:19,360
再次，这是一个非常好的练习，如果你看一下这个公式，让我
look at this formula and take let me look at the other parameters what

1870
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,879
看一下其他参数，当我有很多数据时会发生什么
look at this formula and take let me look at the other parameters what

1871
01:11:20,879 --> 01:11:23,609
看一下其他参数，当我有很多数据时会发生什么
look at the other parameters what happens when I have a lots of data so

1872
01:11:23,609 --> 01:11:23,619
看一下其他参数，当我有很多数据时会发生什么
happens when I have a lots of data so when you take have to go to infinity or

1873
01:11:23,619 --> 01:11:25,410
当您必须去无穷大或者我通常有很多数据时，您可以
happens when I have a lots of data so when you take have to go to infinity or

1874
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:27,180
当您必须去无穷大或者我通常有很多数据时，您可以
when you take have to go to infinity or I usually have a lots of data you can

1875
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:27,190
当您必须去无穷大或者我通常有很多数据时，您可以
I usually have a lots of data you can say with some trivial calculations

1876
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:29,510
通过一些琐碎的计算，基本上可以得出这种预测后验
I usually have a lots of data you can say with some trivial calculations

1877
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:33,689
通过一些琐碎的计算，基本上可以得出这种预测后验
say with some trivial calculations basically that this predicting posterior

1878
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:33,699
通过一些琐碎的计算，基本上可以得出这种预测后验
basically that this predicting posterior distribution comes to be a mixture of

1879
01:11:33,699 --> 01:11:37,140
发行将混合多种选择，您可能会有一些选择
basically that this predicting posterior distribution comes to be a mixture of

1880
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:42,120
发行将混合多种选择，您可能会有一些选择
distribution comes to be a mixture of options okay and you could have some

1881
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:42,130
发行将混合多种选择，您可能会有一些选择
options okay and you could have some even have just this officer alright

1882
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:44,700
甚至只请这个军官好吧，因为您知道您是否有要
options okay and you could have some even have just this officer alright

1883
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,950
甚至只请这个军官好吧，因为您知道您是否有要
even have just this officer alright because you know if you have a list to

1884
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:46,960
甚至只请这个军官好吧，因为您知道您是否有要
because you know if you have a list to data to get all the powers forget

1885
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,810
拥有全部权力的数据会忘记所有您知道的事情，然后再思考
because you know if you have a list to data to get all the powers forget

1886
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:51,290
拥有全部权力的数据会忘记所有您知道的事情，然后再思考
data to get all the powers forget everything you know what then you think

1887
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:51,300
拥有全部权力的数据会忘记所有您知道的事情，然后再思考
everything you know what then you think so every dollar cell is defined by the

1888
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:54,240
所以每个美元单元格都由积分的平均值来定义，例如当我们玩游戏时
everything you know what then you think so every dollar cell is defined by the

1889
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,160
所以每个美元单元格都由积分的平均值来定义，例如当我们玩游戏时
so every dollar cell is defined by the averages of the points like when we play

1890
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:56,170
所以每个美元单元格都由积分的平均值来定义，例如当我们玩游戏时
averages of the points like when we play Nia that belongs to the Gaussian with

1891
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:57,959
属于高斯的Nia具有这种协方差，然后基本上
averages of the points like when we play Nia that belongs to the Gaussian with

1892
01:11:57,959 --> 01:12:01,530
属于高斯的Nia具有这种协方差，然后基本上
Nia that belongs to the Gaussian with this covariance okay and then basically

1893
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:01,540
属于高斯的Nia具有这种协方差，然后基本上
this covariance okay and then basically the mixing questions is the persons

1894
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:04,109
混合的问题是那些具有该组成部分的人
this covariance okay and then basically the mixing questions is the persons

1895
01:12:04,109 --> 01:12:06,359
混合的问题是那些具有该组成部分的人
the mixing questions is the persons having that component there's the total

1896
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:06,369
混合的问题是那些具有该组成部分的人
having that component there's the total number of points okay I mean you know

1897
01:12:06,369 --> 01:12:09,149
点数好吧，我的意思是你知道你可以知道你是否可以
having that component there's the total number of points okay I mean you know

1898
01:12:09,149 --> 01:12:11,370
点数好吧，我的意思是你知道你可以知道你是否可以
number of points okay I mean you know you could have you know if you can its

1899
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:11,380
点数好吧，我的意思是你知道你可以知道你是否可以
you could have you know if you can its money to predict what's to know this

1900
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:14,399
钱来预测这个答案是什么，这是他们承诺的价格
you could have you know if you can its money to predict what's to know this

1901
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:17,760
钱来预测这个答案是什么，这是他们承诺的价格
money to predict what's to know this answer this is a price they did promise

1902
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:17,770
钱来预测这个答案是什么，这是他们承诺的价格
answer this is a price they did promise me if you try to do the answer block and

1903
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:20,609
我，如果您尝试做答案块，那么您会得到一些水，当您
answer this is a price they did promise me if you try to do the answer block and

1904
01:12:20,609 --> 01:12:25,410
我，如果您尝试做答案块，那么您会得到一些水，当您
me if you try to do the answer block and then you get some water and when you

1905
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:25,420
我，如果您尝试做答案块，那么您会得到一些水，当您
then you get some water and when you have a lots of vapor you don't bother to

1906
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:27,569
有很多蒸气，您不用理会，这在其他方面是正确的，是吗
then you get some water and when you have a lots of vapor you don't bother to

1907
01:12:27,569 --> 01:12:32,339
有很多蒸气，您不用理会，这在其他方面是正确的，是吗
have a lots of vapor you don't bother to say is this correct in other ways is it

1908
01:12:32,339 --> 01:12:32,349
有很多蒸气，您不用理会，这在其他方面是正确的，是吗
say is this correct in other ways is it going to give me a bit if it is not

1909
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:33,780
如果不会给你一点你知道的话，我会给我一点
say is this correct in other ways is it going to give me a bit if it is not

1910
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,010
如果不会给你一点你知道的话，我会给我一点
going to give me a bit if it is not going to give you that you know

1911
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:35,020
如果不会给你一点你知道的话，我会给我一点
going to give you that you know something is very wrong with the algebra

1912
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,419
代数还好，所以在这种情况下
going to give you that you know something is very wrong with the algebra

1913
01:12:36,419 --> 01:12:39,209
代数还好，所以在这种情况下
something is very wrong with the algebra okay so in this case when you take the

1914
01:12:39,209 --> 01:12:39,219
代数还好，所以在这种情况下
okay so in this case when you take the limit to lots of data the algebra comes

1915
01:12:39,219 --> 01:12:41,729
限制大量数据代数变得正确以执行此限制
okay so in this case when you take the limit to lots of data the algebra comes

1916
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:45,089
限制大量数据代数变得正确以执行此限制
limit to lots of data the algebra comes to be correct to do this limit you have

1917
01:12:45,089 --> 01:12:45,099
限制大量数据代数变得正确以执行此限制
to be correct to do this limit you have and I

1918
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:48,209
我知道你鼓励你尝试我的意思是不
to be correct to do this limit you have and I

1919
01:12:48,209 --> 01:12:52,109
我知道你鼓励你尝试我的意思是不
and I you know encourage you to try I mean no

1920
01:12:52,109 --> 01:12:52,119
我知道你鼓励你尝试我的意思是不
you know encourage you to try I mean no everything's in the nose at least pull

1921
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:54,569
一切都在鼻子上，至少拉一下，然后变得头晕好吧，所以如果你
you know encourage you to try I mean no everything's in the nose at least pull

1922
01:12:54,569 --> 01:12:58,949
一切都在鼻子上，至少拉一下，然后变得头晕好吧，所以如果你
everything's in the nose at least pull it and then get dizzy okay so if you

1923
01:12:58,949 --> 01:12:58,959
一切都在鼻子上，至少拉一下，然后变得头晕好吧，所以如果你
it and then get dizzy okay so if you follow the algebra you have to use nice

1924
01:12:58,959 --> 01:13:01,799
跟随代数，您必须使用很好的近似值，您知道我能看到
it and then get dizzy okay so if you follow the algebra you have to use nice

1925
01:13:01,799 --> 01:13:03,810
跟随代数，您必须使用很好的近似值，您知道我能看到
follow the algebra you have to use nice approximations you know I can see

1926
01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:03,820
跟随代数，您必须使用很好的近似值，您知道我能看到
approximations you know I can see because there's run of actions you have

1927
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:05,850
因为你有很多动作，史蒂夫（Steve）认为近似公式
approximations you know I can see because there's run of actions you have

1928
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:07,859
因为你有很多动作，史蒂夫（Steve）认为近似公式
because there's run of actions you have you Steve thinks approximation formula

1929
01:13:07,859 --> 01:13:07,869
因为你有很多动作，史蒂夫（Steve）认为近似公式
you Steve thinks approximation formula and approximation kolento paste it

1930
01:13:07,869 --> 01:13:12,779
和近似kolento粘贴，它基本上包括所有后验
you Steve thinks approximation formula and approximation kolento paste it

1931
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:14,399
和近似kolento粘贴，它基本上包括所有后验
and approximation kolento paste it consists of basically all the posterior

1932
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:14,409

consists of basically all the posterior distribution because you are the limit

1933
01:13:14,409 --> 01:13:17,100
分布，因为您是许多数据的限制，成为Delta函数，并且
consists of basically all the posterior distribution because you are the limit

1934
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,709
分布，因为您是许多数据的限制，成为Delta函数，并且

function you get right up okay all right I don't really have any

1939
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,130
好吧，我真的没有时间，所以我们可能会告诉你我们需要
function you get right up okay all right I don't really have any

1940
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:34,110
好吧，我真的没有时间，所以我们可能会告诉你我们需要
all right I don't really have any minutes so we might tell you we need to

1941
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:34,120
好吧，我真的没有时间，所以我们可能会告诉你我们需要
minutes so we might tell you we need to do we need to go back whistling was it

1942
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:37,760
我们需要回口哨吗16谢谢继续，您可以一概而论
minutes so we might tell you we need to do we need to go back whistling was it
